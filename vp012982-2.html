The date and location of the recording was not given. The following is the text as broadcast: <br>We praise God, seek His help, and ask for His forgiveness. <br><br>We seek refuge in God from the evils of our souls and our bad deeds. <br><br>A person who is guided by God will never be misguided by anyone and a person who is misguided by God can never be guided by anyone. <br><br>I bear witness that there is no God but Allah alone, Who has no partner. <br><br><br><br>Attacks divide world <br><br>Amid the huge developments and in the wake of the great strikes that hit the United States in its most important locations in New York and Washington, a huge media clamour has been raised. <br><br>This clamour is unprecedented. It conveyed the opinions of people on these events. <br><br>People were divided into two parts. The first part supported these strikes against US tyranny, while the second denounced them. <br><br>Afterward, when the United States launched the unjust campaign against the Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan, people also split into two parties. <br><br>The first supported these campaigns, while the second denounced and rejected them. <br><br>These tremendous incidents, which have split people into two parties, are of great interest to the Muslims, since many of the rulings pertain to them. <br><br><br><br><br>The polls showed that the vast majority of the sons of the Islamic world were happy about these strikes. <br>Bin Laden on 11 September attacks <br><br><br>These rulings are closely related to Islam and the acts that corrupt a person's Islam. <br><br>Therefore, the Muslims must understand the nature and truth of this conflict so that it will be easy for them to determine where they stand. <br><br>While talking about the truth of the conflict, opinion polls in the world have shown that a little more than 80 per cent of Westerners, of Christians in the United States and elsewhere, have been saddened by the strikes that hit the United States. <br><br>The polls showed that the vast majority of the sons of the Islamic world were happy about these strikes because they believe that the strikes were in reaction to the huge criminality practiced by Israel and the United States in Palestine and other Muslim countries. <br><br>After the strikes on Afghanistan began, these groups changed positions. <br><br>Those who were happy about striking the United States felt sad when Afghanistan was hit, and those who felt sad when the United States was hit were happy when Afghanistan was hit. These groups comprise millions of people. <br><br><br><br>"Barbaric" West <br><br>The entire West, with the exception of a few countries, supports this unfair, barbaric campaign, although there is no evidence of the involvement of the people of Afghanistan in what happened in America. <br><br>The people of Afghanistan had nothing to do with this matter. The campaign, however, continues to unjustly annihilate the villagers and civilians, children, women, and innocent people. <br><br><br>The entire West, with the exception of a few countries, supports this unfair, barbaric campaign. <br><br><br><br>Bin Laden on the West <br><br><br>The positions of the two sides are very clear. Mass demonstrations have spread from the farthest point in the eastern part of the Islamic world to the farthest point in the western part of the Islamic world, and from Indonesia, Philippines, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan to the Arab world and Nigeria and Mauritania. <br><br><br><br>War "fundamentally religious" <br><br>This clearly indicates the nature of this war. This war is fundamentally religious. The people of the East are Muslims. They sympathized with Muslims against the people of the West, who are the crusaders. <br><br>Those who try to cover this crystal clear fact, which the entire world has admitted, are deceiving the Islamic nation. <br><br>They are trying to deflect the attention of the Islamic nation from the truth of this conflict. <br><br>This fact is proven in the book of God Almighty and in the teachings of our messenger, may God's peace and blessings be upon him. <br><br>Under no circumstances should we forget this enmity between us and the infidels. For, the enmity is based on creed. <br><br><br><br>Muslims must stand together <br><br>We must be loyal to the believers and those who believe that there is no God but Allah. <br><br>We should also renounce the atheists and infidels. It suffices me to seek God's help against them. <br><br>God says: "Never will the Jews or the Christians be satisfied with thee unless thou follow their form of religion." <br><br>It is a question of faith, not a war against terrorism, as Bush and Blair try to depict it. <br><br>Many thieves belonging to this nation were captured in the past. But, nobody moved. <br><br><br>It is a question of faith, not a war against terrorism, as Bush and Blair try to depict it. <br><br><br>bin Laden on the war <br><br>The masses which moved in the East and West have not done so for the sake of Osama. <br><br>Rather, they moved for the sake of their religion. This is because they know that they are right and that they resist the most ferocious, serious, and violent Crusade campaign against Islam ever since the message was revealed to Muhammad, may God's peace and blessings be upon. <br><br>After this has become clear, the Muslim must know and learn where he is standing vis-a-vis this war. <br><br><br>"Crusader war" <br><br>After the US politicians spoke and after the US newspapers and television channels became full of clear crusading hatred in this campaign that aims at mobilizing the West against Islam and Muslims, Bush left no room for doubts or the opinions of journalists, but he openly and clearly said that this war is a crusader war. He said this before the whole world to emphasize this fact. <br><br><br>Anyone who lines up behind Bush in this campaign has committed one of the 10 actions that sully one's Islam. <br>Bin Laden names names <br><br><br><br>What can those who allege that this is a war against terrorism say? What terrorism are they speaking about at a time when the Islamic nation has been slaughtered for tens of years without hearing their voices and without seeing any action by them? <br><br>But when the victim starts to take revenge for those innocent children in Palestine, Iraq, southern Sudan, Somalia, Kashmir and the Philippines, the rulers' ulema (Islamic leaders) and the hypocrites come to defend the clear blasphemy. It suffices me to seek God's help against them. <br><br>The common people have understood the issue, but there are those who continue to flatter those who colluded with the unbelievers to anesthetized the Islamic nation to prevent it from carrying out the duty of jihad so that the word of God will be above all words. <br><br>The unequivocal truth is that Bush has carried the cross and raised its banner high and stood at the front of the queue. <br><br>Anyone who lines up behind Bush in this campaign has committed one of the 10 actions that sully one's Islam. <br><br>Muslim scholars are unanimous that allegiance to the infidels and support for them against the believers is one of the major acts that sully Islam. <br><br>Latest stage in "Crusade" <br><br>There is no power but in God. Let us investigate whether this war against Afghanistan that broke out a few days ago is a single and unique one or if it is a link to a long series of crusader wars against the Islamic world. <br><br>Following World War I, which ended more than 83 years ago, the whole Islamic world fell under the crusader banner - under the British, French, and Italian governments. <br><br>They divided the whole world, and Palestine was occupied by the British.  <br><br><br>Since then, and for more than 83 years, our brothers, sons, and sisters in Palestine have been badly tortured. <br><br>Hundreds of thousands of them have been killed, and hundreds of thousands of them have been imprisoned or maimed. <br><br>"Crusade" against Chechens <br><br>Let us examine the recent developments. Take for example the Chechens. <br><br>They are a Muslim people who have been attacked by the Russian bear which embraces the Christian Orthodox faith. <br><br>Russians have annihilated the Chechen people in their entirety and forced them to flee to the mountains where they were assaulted by snow and poverty and diseases. <br><br>Nonetheless, nobody moved to support them. There is no strength but in God. <br><br>"Crusade" against Bosnia <br><br>This was followed by a war of genocide in Bosnia in sight and hearing of the entire world in the heart of Europe. <br><br>For several years our brothers have been killed, our women have been raped, and our children have been massacred in the safe havens of the United Nations and with its knowledge and cooperation. <br><br>Those who refer our tragedies today to the United Nations so that they can be resolved are hypocrites who deceive God, His Prophet and the believers. <br><br>UN "collusion"<br><br>Are not our tragedies but caused by the United Nations? Who issued the Partition Resolution on Palestine in 1947 and surrendered the land of Muslims to the Jews? It was the United Nations in its resolution in 1947. <br><br>Those who claim that they are the leaders of the Arabs and continue to appeal to the United Nations have disavowed what was revealed to Prophet Muhammad, God's peace and blessings be upon him. <br><br>Those who refer things to the international legitimacy have disavowed the legitimacy of the Holy Book and the tradition of Prophet Muhammad, God's peace and blessings be upon him. <br><br>This is the United Nations from which we have suffered greatly. Under no circumstances should any Muslim or sane person resort to the United Nations. The United Nations is nothing but a tool of crime. <br><br>We are being massacred everyday, while the United Nations continues to sit idly by. <br><br>Kashmir and Chechens <br><br>Our brothers in Kashmir have been subjected to the worst forms of torture for over 50 years. They have been massacred, killed, and raped. Their blood has been shed and their houses have been trespassed upon.  <br><br><br>Still, the United Nations continues to sit idly by. <br><br>Today, and without any evidence, the United Nations passes resolutions supporting unjust and tyrannical America, which oppresses these helpless people who have emerged from a merciless war at the hands of the Soviet Union. <br><br>Let us look at the second war in Chechnya, which is still underway. The entire Chechen people are being embattled once again by this Russian bear. <br><br>The humanitarian agencies, even the US ones, demanded that President Clinton should stop supporting Russia. <br><br>However, Clinton said that stopping support for Russia did not serve US interests. <br><br>A year ago, Putin demanded that the cross and the Jews should stand by him. He told them: You must support us and thank us because we are waging a war against Muslim fundamentalism. <br><br>The enemies are speaking very clearly. While this is taking place, the leaders of the region hide and are ashamed to support their brothers. <br><br>East Timor and Somalia <br><br>Let us examine the stand of the West and the United Nations in the developments in Indonesia when they moved to divide the largest country in the Islamic world in terms of population. <br><br><br>We should view events not as separate links, but as links in a long series of conspiracies, a war of annihilation. <br>Bin Laden on "Crusade" <br><br><br><br>This criminal, Kofi Annan, was speaking publicly and putting pressure on the Indonesian government, telling it: You have 24 hours to divide and separate East Timor from Indonesia. <br><br>Otherwise, we will be forced to send in military forces to separate it by force. <br><br>The crusader Australian forces were on Indonesian shores, and in fact they landed to separate East Timor, which is part of the Islamic world. <br><br>Therefore, we should view events not as separate links, but as links in a long series of conspiracies, a war of annihilation in the true sense of the word. <br><br>In Somalia, on the excuse of restoring hope, 13,000 of our brothers were killed. In southern Sudan, hundreds of thousands were killed. <br><br>Palestinians and Iraqis <br><br>But when we move to Palestine and Iraq, there can be no bounds to what can be said. <br><br>Over one million children were killed in Iraq. The killing is continuing. <br><br>As for what is taking place in Palestine these days, I can only say we have no one but God to complain to. <br><br>What is taking place cannot be tolerated by any nation. I do not say from the nations of the human race, but from other creatures, from the animals. They would not tolerate what is taking place. <br><br>A confidant of mine told me that he saw a butcher slaughtering a camel in front of another camel. <br><br>The other camel got agitated while seeing the blood coming out of the other camel. Thus, it burst out with rage and bit the hand of the man and broke it. <br><br>How can the weak mothers in Palestine endure the killing of their children in front of their eyes by the unjust Jewish executioners with US support and with US aircraft and tanks? <br><br>Israel and US "are one" <br><br>Those who distinguish between America and Israel are the real enemies of the nation. They are traitors who betrayed God and His prophet, and who betrayed their nation and the trust placed in them. They anesthetize the nation. <br><br>These battles cannot be viewed in any case whatsoever as isolated battles, but rather, as part of a chain of the long, fierce, and ugly crusader war. <br><br>Every Muslim must stand under the banner of There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is God's Prophet.  <br><br><br>I remind you of what our Prophet, may God's peace and blessings upon him, told Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with him. <br><br>He told him: Boy, I am going to teach you a few words. Obey God, He will protect you. Obey Him, you will find Him on your side. If you ask for something, ask God. If you seek help, seek the help of God. <br><br>You should know that if all people come together to help you, they will only help you with something that God has already preordained for you. <br><br>And if they assemble to harm you, they will only harm you with something that God has already preordained for you. God wrote man's fate and it will never change. <br><br>I Tell the Muslims who did their utmost during these weeks: You must continue along the same march. <br><br>Your support for us will make us stronger and will further support your brothers in Afghanistan. <br><br>Exert more efforts in combating this unprecedented war crime. <br><br>Fear God, O Muslims and rise to support your religion. Islam is calling on you: O Muslims, O Muslims, O Muslims. <br><br>God bear witness that I have conveyed the message. God bear witness that I have conveyed the message. God bear witness that I have conveyed the message. <br><br>God's peace and blessings be upon you. <br><br><br><br>
