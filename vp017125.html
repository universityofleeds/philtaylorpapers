<br>Blair in hot water over execution claim 
<br>
<br>March 30 2003, 8:08 AM 
<br>
<br>London: The bodies of the first British servicemen to die in the Iraq war were flown home today amid controversy over Prime Minister Tony Blair's claims that two soldiers were executed by Iraqi forces.
<br>
<br>As anti-war demonstrations were kicking off across the country, Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon and Prince Andrew, Queen Elizabeth's second son, attended a ceremony to mark the return of ten dead soldiers at a Royal Air Force base in Brize Norton, west England.
<br>
<br>A C-17 military cargo aircraft carrying their bodies touched down at the base just after midday (2300 AEDT).
<br>
<br>With an air force flag flying at half mast, a Royal Marines band played as each coffin was slowly brought from the aircraft to a waiting hearse before being driven to a temporary mortuary.
<br>
<br>Eight of the dead British servicemen were killed when the US Sea Knight helicopter they were aboard crashed south of the Kuwaiti border on March 21.
<br>
<br>The other two bodies were those of the crew of the British GR4 Tornado warplane which was hit near the Kuwaiti border by a US Patriot missile last Sunday.
<br>
<br>According to official figures, 23 British soldiers have been killed in total since the start of the US-led war on March 20 - 14 in helicopter accidents, four in combat, and five as a result of "friendly fire".
<br>
<br>In London, the defence ministry said it had apologised to the families of two soldiers after Prime Minister Tony Blair, Washington's staunchest ally in the US-led war, publicly denounced their "execution" by Iraqi forces before the men's relatives had been told.
<br>
<br>A defence ministry spokesman told AFP: "We have apologised that they weren't informed about the possibility that their loved ones were executed before they learnt about it from the media."
<br>
<br>During a press conference after a summit with US President George W Bush Thursday at Camp David near Washington, Blair said that two British soldiers, whose bodies were displayed on footage taken by Arabic TV station Al-Jazeera in southern Iraq, were "executed".
<br>
<br>"If anyone needed any further evidence of the depravity of (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein's regime, this atrocity provides it. It is yet one more flagrant breach of all the proper conventions of war," Blair said.
<br>
<br>But the family of one of the dead soldiers accused the prime minister of "lying".
<br>
<br>The sister of sapper Luke Allsopp told the Daily Mirror tabloid that officers from his barracks told her he had died on the spot in battle.
<br>
<br>At a news conference in London yesterday, armed forces minister Adam Ingram expressed "regret" for any distress that had been caused, while acknowledging that it had not formally been established that the soldiers were executed.
<br>
<br>Asked about media reports of a pause of four to six days in the offensive towards Baghdad, British military spokesman Captain Al Lockwood told Sky News today: "I would not call it a pause. It is purely a case of shaping the battlefield, getting out our troops equipped and in the right place for the next part of the campaign."
<br>
<br>Meanwhile, a British military spokesman today denied media reports that up to five other British soldiers had been captured in Basra, saying that no British troops had gone missing overnight.
<br>
<br>But the defence ministry did confirm that one British soldier was missing, presumed dead, and four others were injured in a separate incident apparently involving friendly fire.
<br>
<br>Britain's Press Association reported that the soldier was killed after a US A10 tankbuster plane targeted two armoured vehicles near Basra but the defence ministry said it was still investigating the circumstances.
<br>
<br>The Daily Mirror tabloid reported today that the number of British troops serving in the Gulf could be cut dramatically from 45,000 to 5,000 if the US-led war against Iraq drags on for at least six months.
<br>
<br>Britain's main anti-war group, the Stop The War Coalition, said protest marches against the conflict were being staged in at least 20 cities as a way of "expressing mounting anger at the news of the rising civilian casualties".
<br>
<br>A rally was planned outside BBC television offices in London as part of a campaign for more media coverage of deaths and injuries to civilians.
