<br>
<br>TITLE:   AN  ANALYSIS  OF  GULF WAR  PSYOPS  AND  THEIR APPLI-
<br>         CABILITY TO FUTURE OPERATIONS
<br>
<br>AUTHOR:  Major Peter A. Whitenack, United States Marine Corps
<br>
<br>THESIS:  The  many-faceted  PSYOP  contribution  to victory in the  Persian  Gulf  War  should  be examined in more detail to determine  how  its  lessons  may  be  better  integrated into preparations  for  dealing  with  conflicts  in the lean times ahead.
<br>
<br>BACKGROUND:   U.S.   military   planners   were   pivotal  in developing   and   executing   a  coordinated,  multi-national combined  arms  theater  campaign  that succeeded in defeating Iraq.    Time  for  planning  and  coordination was a decisive determinant  of this success, and this type of opportunity maynot  be  afforded  us  to  prepare similarly for future operations.    PSYOPS  in the Persian Gulf War actively spanned the conflict  and  supported all elements of the theater campaign.
<br>
<br>While  integration of PSYOPS into operational planning was not conducted   according   to   doctrine,   it  was  nevertheless effective  in  all mediums, significantly contributing to mass capitulation  of  Iraqi forces and an overwhelming victory for the  Coalition.    While  PSYOPS  efforts successfully complmented  operations  in  the field, planning was initiated from the bottom up for approval.
<br>
<br>RECOMMENDATION:   That  psychological  warfare  operations  in the  Persian  Gulf War be thoroughly studied for establishment of  future  doctrinal  concepts  in  order to realize the full potential of this effective force multiplier.

<br>           AN ANALYSIS OF GULF WAR PSYOPS AND THEIR
<br>              APPLICABILITY TO FUTURE OPERATIONS
<br>
<br>
<br>    U.S.  military  planners  were  pivotal  in developing and executing  a coordinated, multi-national combined arms theater campaign  that  succeeded  in  defeating  Iraq.   The U.S.-led Coalition built a multi-national armed force capable of offensive  operations,  and executed massive logistics preparations in  order  to  support  and  sustain  it.    Inasmuch  as  the Coalition  had  sufficient  time  to  plan and prepare for the offensive,  forces  exploited  the time available to reach the 
<br>highest  possible  levels  of unit proficiency.  Time, in this case,  as a decisive determinant of success, was a significant advantage  that  may not be available in future crises.  This, coupled  with  the  new  politics  of  the  defense budget and ongoing  force  restructuring,  is  forcing  us to think about ways to fight more efficiently.
<br>
<br>    In   searching   for  ways  to  maintain  future  mission effectiveness  in the face of force drawdown, it would be wise to  examine  the impact that psychological operations (PSYOPS) had  in facilitating U.S. objectives in the Gulf War.  According  to  the  final  report  to  Congress by the Department of Defense,  CONDUCT  OF  THE  PERSIAN GULF WAR, (3:87) the PYSOP effort  was focused on breaking  the Iraqi will to resist, and on increasing the fears of Iraqi soldiers.  On G-Day, 24 February 1991, the Commander-in-Chief, Central Command remarked  that ".... .we  were  succeeding  beyond  our expectations...I  was  overwhelmed,"  (10:456) regarding his campaign in  which  the  first  day of the ground offensive saw a shift from  deliberate  attack  to  exploitation.    The  unexpected degree  of  success  enjoyed  by the Coalition can be directly attributed  to  the manner  in  which PSYOPS complemented the overall  conduct of operations against the enemy in the Kuwait Theater of Operations.
<br>
<br>    As  traditional  "users  of propaganda against the enemy," PSYOP  units generated initiatives during the Persian Gulf War which   employed  standard,  dedicated  communications  assets (principally  broadcasting   and printing equipment) in support of  combat  operations.    (8:25)    Across the theater, these activities complemented Coalition operations and directly contributed  to  the  unexpectedly  rapid  demise of Saddam's war machine.    Psychological  warfare  operations  took  on  both
<br>subtle  and  overt forms during the Gulf War.  In combination, they  constituted  a  significant force multiplier in enabling the  Coalition to inflict a crushing defeat upon Iraqi forces, and  in  decisively concluding operations with minimal loss of life.    The many-faceted PSYOP contribution to victory in the Gulf  War  is  worth examining in more detail to determine how its  lessons  may  be  better integrated into preparations for dealing with conflicts in the lean times ahead.
<br>
<br>    Before  Coalition  forces  fired  the  first  shots in the Persian  Gulf  War, a different type of force had already been assembled  for months, and was engaged in a pitched battle for dominance  over  Iraqi  forces.    Far away from headlines and newscasts,  PSYOPS initiatives were bombarding Saddam's empire in  the   form of wave upon wave of leaflet and radio assaults.
<br>
<br>Planing   for  psychological operations began immediately after the  invasion  of  Kuwait.    In  early  August  1990, a PSYOP planning  group  consisting of military and civilian personnel from  CENTCOM,  SOCOM,  and  the  4th Psychological Operations Group  (POG)  from  Fort  Bragg  was  formed  at  HQ, CENTCOM, MacDill  Air  Force  Base,  Florida.    This  group became the nucleus   of  the  PSYOP  command  and  control  element  that deployed  to Saudi Arabia in late August.  The 4th POG command element  was  followed  shortly thereafter in September by its subordinate  8th PSYOP Battalion, task-organized with elements of  the  PSYOP  Dissemination Battalion (PDB), to form the 8th Psychological  Operations  Task  Force.  The POTF's deployment began  what was to become a highly successful use of PSYOPS in support  of  combat  operations  in  Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iraq.
<br>
<br>    Persian  Gulf  War  strategic  and  tactical  field  level psychological  operations  supported  the goals and conditions set  forth  by President Bush and other Coalition leaders upon an  international  scale.    The field level implementation of those  international goals and conditions were, as a matter of course,  effected  through  theater level military operations. Integral  to  those  campaign executions were a series of well established,  time-tested  precepts,  judiciously  applied  by CENTCOM  psychological  warfare  operators.   The Persian Gulf War  PSYOP  campaign  basically mirrored the missions of CINC,US  CENTCOM, and alternately the Saudi Armed Forces Commander, Lieutenant  General  Kahlid  Bin Sultan.  Upon deployment, the 4th  PSYOP  began  a  comprehensive  analysis of both of these commanders'  missions,  as  well  as  the combined missions of units  subordinate to their command, and developed a guideline of probable PSYOP-based mission objectives.
<br>
<br>    During  the  initial  stages  of  Operation DESERT SHIELD, CENTCOM's  principal  goal  was  the  defense of Saudi Arabia.  The  rapid  deployment  of  tens of thousands of U.S. and non-Arab  foreign  forces  to what had for almost 600 years been a "closed  kingdom",  set  the stage for complicating an already extremely  tense  situation.    In  support  of  easing  these tensions,  the  4th PSYOP augmented the commander's mission by demonstrating  to the regional Arab population that the United States  was  only  one  member  of  a broader coalition force. Further,  through  a  portrayal  of  encompassed  unity  which included  Arab  forces,  the goal of the United States government  was  not  to  conquer  or  dominate the Arab world as an imperialist  venture.   This task was principally accomplished during the initial months of DESERT SHIELD through the distribution  of  a videocassette message to Saudi Arabian and other regional  television stations.  The regional broadcast of this multinational-power videotape  was  "designed  to demonstrate U.S.  resolve  and  encourage support for Coalition efforts in the  region."    (12:7)    The format of the videocassette was grafted  from international news cuts which featured prominent Arab  and  other  international  speakers  at  United  Nations councils  and various  Arab  regional  summits.    First,  it demonstrated  the  political  and military  strength  of  the combined  forces  which  were arrayed against Iraq.  Moreover, the  tape  not  only  strengthened  America's  argument  as to Coalition  partnership, but also assured in no uncertain terms that   the  U.S.  was  there  to  do  good  things  and,  more importantly,  that  the  Iraqis  were not.  As Coalition force levels   in  Saudi  Arabia    increased and missions changed with respect  to  the    changing  political  and military situation, these  videocassette  supporting efforts similarly changed, by phase,   to   reflect   offensive,  consolidation,  and  enemy prisoner operations throughout Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq.
<br>
<br>    With  closure  of  forces, the anticipation of hostilities dictated  the  development of other, more traditional forms of propaganda.    Several  specific  campaigns were orchestrated, including   operations   dealing  with  the  individual  Iraqi soldier,   elements  within  the  Iraqi  command  and  control structure,  and  operations  which  exclusively  addressed the Iraqi  civilian  population.    The campaign organized against
<br>the  individual  Iraqi soldier was divided into specific time-phased  campaigns  including  pre-air war and several post-air war  segments.    These  distinct  campaigns began development simultaneously  during  early  September,  and  were  executed variously as opportunities became available, or as required.
<br>
<br>    The  Persian  Gulf  War  PSYOPS  campaign  began  with the utilization   of  standard,  doctrinal  psychological  warfare processes.    (4:54)    The initial process of target analysis allowed  for development of PSYOPS campaign objectives in line with military  objectives,  as  determined  and delineated by CENTCOM.     Probable  psychological  vulnerabilities  of  the target  audience  were  analyzed  and  projected  over time to determine  a systematic methodology for delivery.  An order of relevant  priorities  was  then  established, which 4th PSYOPS eventually  utilized  as a flexible baseline in the conduct of its  campaign.    This  target analysis effort culminated in a PSYOP  campaign  which  emphasized  continual  themes  of "the futility  of  resistance;  inevitability of defeat; surrender; desertion   and   defection;  abandonment  of  equipment;  and blaming  the  war  on Saddam Hussein."  (1:16)  The consideration  of  national  policy  guidelines  was also indoctrinated within  that  process;  a process which, in essence, is not at all  unlike a civilian advertising campaign, which attempts to ascertain  audience  acceptance  and appeal to any given topic through analytical research.
<br>
<br>    Throughout  the  buildup period from September to December 1990,  the  majority of effort concentrated on target analysis and  campaign  control efforts, with initial planning directed toward  easily  coordinated and obtainable PSYOP dissemination methods.    In addition to the videocassette operation already discussed, PSYOP materials  were  disseminated  upon  their distinctive  audiences through three basic methodologies.  The first  method, and most effective, was aerial leaflet dissemination.    Scripted  field  level  radio  transmissions, and a combination  of  both  ground  and  air loudspeaker broadcasts provided  the  two  additional  techniques used throughout the conflict.
<br>
<br>    Kuwait  Theater  of  Operations-generated PSYOPS materials were  required  to  pass through several approval levels prior to  achieving  final acceptance for target audience dissemination.   These various acceptance levels included, but were not limited  to,  the  Commander,  4th PSYOPS, CENTCOM's J-3 staff coordinator,   as  well  as  Headquarters  for  Saudi  Arabian General  Khalid  and  General  Schwarzkopf.   Although General Schwartzkopf  did  not  personally approve or disapprove every product   type,   there   were  specific  instances  where  he personally  did  become involved in the process.  
<br>
<br>Streamlining measures  in  the  approval process were delegated to subordinate  echelons.    Fail-safe  approval  mechanisms were established  to  avoid  the  possible  stating, negative impact which  an  improper message  or  appeal  might  incur upon an already  hostile   Iraqi  audience.   If leaflets, tapes, radio scripts  or  any   other  PSYOP materials did not meet specific cultural,  contextual  or  tactical criteria as defined by the various  levels  of approval authority, they were returned for modification,   resubmission   or   destruction,   as   deemed appropriate.
<br>
<br>    Leaflet  development  proved to be a very tedious process, due  in  principle  to  the  many  layers of consideration and acceptance  as  discussed,  as  well  as the physical distance between  staffing  and  printing  facilities.   Actual leaflet development   occurred   at  Riyadh,  with  digitized  imagery transmission  to PDB printing facilities at Dhahran.  Although leaflet   themes   were   being  continually  generated  since September,  the  first  officially  acknowledged  instance  of dissemination  did  not  occur until the 12th of January, when Kuwait  City  was targeted with two distinct leaflet variants.
<br>
<br>(6:45)
<br>
<br>    Development  of the 29.1 million propaganda leaflets which were  eventually  printed  for  dissemination  in  the  Kuwait Theater   of   Operations   took  place   within  a  jointly-coordinated,  combined propaganda cell in Riyadh.  (12.7)  The combined  cell established functional control over the generation  of  all  leaflet,  radio,  script,  deceptive, and other PSYOP  materials.    Available  within  the combined cell were experienced  Saudi   and  Kuwaiti military PSYOP personnel, who worked  both in the development of new propaganda concepts and in  modifying  many  of  the  concepts  which had already been
<br>developed.    Leaflet  development  was designed to foster and expound  upon  key  action  points  or  "verbs"  determined in target analysis  as enemy vulnerabilities.  (6:42)  These key "verbs"  were  considered essential to successful execution of the  PSYOP  campaign  as it related to the operational scheme.
<br>
<br>For  example,  during  the pre-ground war campaign, key action leaflet   verbs  were  developed  for  exploitation  such  as:
<br>
<br>Saddam--Death--Hunger--Bombing--Family--Cease   Resistance--Be Safe,  etc.    
<br>
<br>Key verbiage, multi- national expertise, PSYOP themes  integrated with operational planning, and high quality
<br>printing  control  resulted in a viable PSYOP medium which was extensively used throughout the Kuwait Theater of Operations.
<br>
<br>    While  efforts  for  popular support of Saddam's overthrow were  being made  by  President  Bush and other Coalition and world  leaders, PSYOP leaflet and radio broadcasting campaigns disseminated  parallel  messages  upon  the Iraqi military and civilian  populations.    The  principal  method  for  leaflet dissemination  was  through  aerial delivery.  Prior to combat operations,  leaflets  were  disseminated  by  C-130 aircraft; they  were  dropped  from  high  altitudes  along the southern
<br>Kuwaiti  border  and  followed  wind  patterns  to  cover  the majority  of  front-line  Iraqi  units  in  Kuwait.  Specially configured  M-129E1   leaflet   bombs   were  later  utilized effectively  by  B-52, F-16 and F/A-18 aircraft throughout the theater.
<br>
<br>    Leaflet  delivery  supported  both  combat  and  deception operations  across  the  entire  theater and had a significant impact  in  contributing  to  degradation  of enemy morale and will  to  fight.   The coordination of leaflet operations with bombing   of   enemy  front-line  positions  was  particularly effective.    Leaflet  deliveries warning of impending bombing missions  on  specific  units and sites were actually followed by  the   promised bombings, making the PSYOP campaign credible among    Iraqi  soldiers,   and  producing  large  numbers  of desertions   and  defections.     (11:9)  Leaflets  warning of impending   amphibious  invasion  by U.S.  forces  were  given credence  and  likewise   supported that deception and, even by conservative  estimates,  helped  to divert at least two enemy divisions  to  the  coast.   (1:18)  Leaflets overprinted with VII   and  XVIII  Airborne Corps' unit insignia were intentionally   disseminated  along  avenues  of  approach  into  Iraqi
<br>positions  where CENTCOM wanted the Iraqis to believe the main U.S.  effort  would  be  concentrated.   Iraqi troop movements were  subsequently monitored, confirming the credibility which the leaflets had in eliciting such a response.
<br>
<br>    Radio  and  loudspeaker  operations similarly complemented combat  and deception operations.  Throughout the Persian Gulf War,  many  hundreds  of  hours  of intrusive radio broadcasts were  made  through  both  open  and  clandestine radio transmissions.    "Voice  of  the Gulf" and the "Radio Free Kuwait" campaigns  are examples of such 4th PSYOP initiatives.  "Radio Free  Kuwait,"  for  example,  communicated exclusively to the Kuwaiti   resistance   movement   with  instructions  to  that
<br>organization's   operations  in  support  of  the  coalition's invasion timetable.
<br>
<br>    Other  PSYOP  radio  intrusions  into  Iraqi airspace were physically  accomplished  by two methods.  The first method to be  initiated  entailed ground based Special Forces teams dispersed  along  the  Saudi/Kuwaiti  border in early October and November.      Utilizing  vehicular  mounted  low  power  (AM) transmitters,  these  early broadcasts targeted Iraqi military personnel  within  occupied  Kuwait.    The  second  4th PSYOP broadcast  initiative  consisted  of  Voice  of the Gulf (VOG) transmissions,  which  typically broadcast 18 hours per day on multiple  AM and FM frequencies.  Radio scripts were developed within  a  distinct  4th  PSYOP  combined cell in Riyadh, with emphasis  that  VOG not be identified as a PSYOPS station.  In that  regard,  the  station's  format  consisted  primarily of regional  Arabic  music.   The abundance of music was designed to  hold  Iraqi  and Kuwaiti target audiences' attention, with only  periodic  interruption  with  selected  script read by a native Kuwaiti broadcaster.
<br>
<br>    A  deficiency  in  U.S. Army active duty field-level loudspeaker  assets  early in Operation DESERT SHIELD necessitated the  activation of reserve loudspeaker teams.  Drawn primarily from  six  locations  in  the  U.S., they comprised a total of sixty-six  three-man, vehicular-mounted teams with 4th PSYOPS, and  were  attached  to  virtually  every brigade-level ground maneuver  unit  within the Kuwait Theater of Operations.  Once assigned,  loudspeaker  teams  were  tasked  with broadcasting
<br>specific,  audience  taped  messages  upon the Iraqi military.
<br>
<br>In  addition to deceptive noises and sound effects, tapes were used  in issuing vocal appeals and instructions to the Iraqis, to  coerce  them into surrendering.  Limited PSYOP loudspeaker support  missions  were also conducted by helicopter, but were not   acknowledged  as  efficient  due  to  conflicting  rotor noise.    A loudspeaker team from 9th POB, attached to the 1st Marine  Division's  300-man  Task  Force  "TROY,"  contributed significantly  to  that unit's deception mission.  Deployed to mask  the  movement  of 2d Marine Division to its new assembly area  prior  to the ground assault, the contribution of PSYOPS 
<br>loudspeakers  to  the  Task  Force's  success was evidenced in captured  Iraqi  intelligence documents.  Three separate Iraqi brigades  in  the  Wafrah  area  listed  Task  Force TROY as a division-sized unit, mechanized, preparing to attack.  (7:77)
<br>
<br>    Operational  and tactical considerations for theater-level PSYOPS  objective  were,  for  the  most  part,  collected and staffed  by  planners  and  liaison  officers  affiliated with major  commands  within the Kuwait Theater of Operations.  One prominent  staff  officer  and  participant  within the Riyadh coordination  cell  indicated  that planning for PSYOP support to  operations  was,  more  often than not, conducted from the
<br>bottom  up  in  formulating objectives.  (1:20)   Procedurally, this  deviates  from  established  doctrine  which states that PSYOPS  must  be  coordinated  from theater to division level, and  that the G-3 is responsible for integrating psychological and  combat  operations.    (5:7-22,  23)    During Operations DESERT  SHIELD  and   DESERT  STORM approval actually did occur through   the  J-3.     More  aggressive,  doctrinally  correct coordination  may  have produced even more successful results.
<br>
<br>J-3   generation  of  PSYOP  requirements to enhance the operational  scheme  would  have  not  only  streamlined propaganda production,  but could have ensured that maximum support would be given during preassault, assault and consolidation phases.
<br>
<br>    The  impact  of the basic doctrinal forms of psychological operations  exercised against the Iraqi military in Kuwait was complemented,  and  actually  made possible, by forces, operations,  and  events.    PSYOPS exploited the full potential of these  factors  and  acted  as a force multiplier in regard to establishing  Coalition  advantages which undoubtedly affected the  decision   of  many Iraqis to surrender.  PSYOPS magnified the  presence   of  the  Coalition in the eyes of the enemy and amplified  its potential and advantages to the maximum extent, particularly in the following areas:
<br>
<br>    Sea Power
<br>
<br>    Amphibious Capability
<br>
<br>    Air Superiority
<br>
<br>    Weapons and Equipment Terminology
<br>
<br>    Night Operations Capability
<br>
<br>    Force Presence
<br>
<br>    Training State
<br>
<br>    Sense of Purpose, Just Cause and Coalition
<br>
<br>    NBC Defense
<br>
<br>PSYOPS  further  contributed  to  the  enemy's rapid demise by exploiting  the  following perceived weaknesses common to many Iraqi ground units in Kuwait:
<br>
<br>    Interrupted Command and Control
<br>
<br>    Isolation
<br>
<br>    Hunger
<br>
<br>    Morality of Invasion ("19th Province", Unjust Cause)
<br>

<br>
<br>    Prior  to  military  offensive  operations,  PSYOP efforts prompted   the   individual  Iraqi  soldier  to  question  the validity  of why he was physically stationed in Kuwait.  In so doing,  soldiers were automatically and implicitly questioning the  judgment of their superiors in placing them there.  Later widespread  lack  of confidence in leaders, dwindling supplies and  a  feeling  of  helplessness  in  the face of a perceived superior  foe,  attrition  and imminent threat of invasion all contributed  to  incapacitate many units' combat effectiveness with  bad  morale  and lack of cohesion.  PSYOPS supported the
<br>operational  scheme  by enhancing the overriding atmosphere of despair  which  had  been  made more acute through devastating air attacks prior to commencement of the ground war.
<br>
<br>    Psychological  operations  not  only  channelled  a common emotional  commitment from Iraqi combatants and provided sound reasonings  for  ceasing the struggle, but demonstrated proper surrender  techniques so as to avoid needless death.  Explicit PSYOP verbal  and visual direction was given to units of all types  with  specific  direction as to method of surrender for dismounted  or mechanized personnel when approaching Coalition
<br>forces.    In only one instance did this instruction result in treachery,  when  elements of the Iraqi 5th Mechanized Brigade used  PSYOP  surrender  procedures  as  a  ruse  in  order  to approach  Al  Khafji  unmolested.   (13:270)  By demonstrating that   Iraqi   military   hardware,  and  not  the  combatants themselves,  were  the  object  of Coalition targetings, Iraqi soldiers  quickly  garnered  a  sincere  respect for Coalition motives  and  thereby  found  it easier to show commitment and eventually   engage  in wholesale surrender.  As a proven force multiplier,  the  impact of PSYOPS on the Persian Gulf War was perhaps  best  alluded  to  by  Lieutenant  General W. Boomer, USMC,  COM  FOR MARCENT,  on  the  day  of  the  cease  fire:
<br>
<br>"...Their  morale  being  extremely  low  in  this  case,  the clean-up  didn't  turn  out  to  be  the  huge  fight  we  had anticipated."  (2)
<br>
<br>    The   effective   manipulation  of  the  enemy's  tactical perception  of  the  battlefield  helped  create the degree of security  and  cover  needed  to  execute  CENTCOM's  flanking maneuver.    The  result  was  the  destruction of much of the regular  Army,  significant  damage  to  the Republican Guard, overall  mission  accomplishment  and  minimal  loss  of  life through a supportive and complementary PSYOP campaign.
<br>
<br>    The   Persian   Gulf  War  has  shown  that  psychological operations  are  more than just a "minor appendage to military operations."    (9:9)   Clausewitz saw war as "an act of force to  compel our adversary to do our will; .. .to impose our will upon  the  enemy is the object."  (14.3)  In a world where the potential  for simultaneous involvement of U.S. forces in more than  one  conflict is not unlikely, and at a time when we are experiencing  a  seemingly  irreversible  reduction  in force, perhaps  more  attention  to PSYOPS and its proper application is  warranted.    Regardless  of  the environment and level of conflict  intensity,  it  would  seem  prudent to explore this possibility  further,  and  expand  the lessons of the Persian Gulf  War  PSYOP  campaign  to  facilitate  future operations, integrated with this proven force multiplier.
