<br>British Soldier Held Over Iraqis Torture Photos
<br>
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>LONDON, May 30 2003(IslamOnline.net & News Agencies) - A British soldier has been questioned over sickening "torture" photos of Iraqi prisoners of war while the U.S.-led invasion was raging.
<br>
<br>Military police quizzed a British soldier in custody after photographs emerged showing invasion forces "torturing" Iraqi PoWs, the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) said.
<br>
<br>The photos showed an Iraqi PoW dangling from a fork-lift truck, and others depict soldiers committing sex acts near captured Iraqis, The Sun newspaper charged.
<br>
<br>One snap showed an Iraqi PoW who was bound and gagged. He was bundled up in netting suspended from the fork-lift which was driven by a British soldier, said the best-selling tabloid.
<br>
<br>It is believed the prisoner was alive when the pictures were taken in southern Iraq as the aggression was running, said the British paper.
<br>
<br>The MoD confirmed that a soldier was being held in military custody while the Special Investigations Branch of the Royal Military Police launched an inquiry, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported.
<br>
<br>"We confirm an investigation is under way into allegations of photos depicting maltreatment of Iraqi PoWs," a ministry spokeswoman said.
<br>
<br>If the pictures are found to show real Iraqis, and have not been stage-managed, such treatment would be a breach of the Geneva Convention which governs the treatment of POWs, she admitted.
<br>
<br>"We cannot comment further. But if there is any truth in these allegations the MoD is appalled. We take responsibility to PoWs extremely seriously."
<br>
<br>The MoD refused to confirm the soldiers' identity, unit or hometown.
<br>
<br>But the BBC News Online said the pictures are believed to have been taken by a soldier serving with the 1st Royal Regiment of Fusiliers in southern Iraq at the time of the events.
<br>
<br>The Sun said the soldier was arrested by civilian police at his home in the English Midlands, where he was on leave following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.
<br>
<br>Britain contributed 45,000 military personnel, a naval task force and more than 100 aircraft to the war, and British forces currently occupy the southern part of Iraq.
<br>
<br>An investigation is already underway into charges that a colonel in the Royal Irish Regiment, Tim Collins, abused Iraqi PoWs and civilians.
<br>
<br>The charges were made by a U.S. army reservist tongue-lashed by Collins for handing out lollipops to Iraqi children.
<br>
<br>The 1st battalion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers -- part of the 7th Armoured Brigade, nicknamed the Desert Rats -- is based in Celle, Germany.
<br>
<br>The Fusiliers were also involved in Gulf War I in 1991 - and lost nine men when American jets strafed their armoured personnel carriers.
<br>
<br>Cluster Bombs Used
<br>
<br>The investigations into torturing Iraqi PoWs come as British Defense Minister Adam Ingram admitted that the Anglo-American forces did use cluster bombs in densely populated areas during the Iraq invasion.
<br>
<br>Seventy-five Labor MPs are calling for cluster bombs, which can leave unexploded "bomblets", to be banned because of the threat they pose to civilians, the BBC News Online reported.
<br>
<br>British Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon on April 3 told lawmakers that cluster bombs were used only when it was "absolutely justified" because it would "make the battlefield safer for our armed forces".
