<br>US 'Psyops' broadcasts Celine Dion leads
<br>US propaganda war
<br>
<br> 
<br>No jokes about 'weapons of mass destruction' please: US 'Psyops' broadcasters have added songs by Canadian singer Celine Dion to their assault on Iraqi radio audiences. Takuya Hirayama of Clandestine Radio Watch Japan listened in. 
<br>US 'psyops' station Information Radio was monitored on December 18 broadcasting on both 9715 and 11292 kHz to southern Iraq. 
<br>
<br>The signals, registered across Europe and the Middle East as well as Japan, were monitored by supporters of Clandestine Radio Watch, a volunteer group that studies the activities of covert radio broadcasters. 
<br>
<br>With one female and two male native Iraqi speakers as announcers the station aired popular Arabic music, including songs by Iraqi and Lebanese artists, and some western music, notably the theme song from the film Titanic, 'My Heart Will Go On' by Celine Dion. 
<br>
<br>"The music did not immediately appear to carry subversive undertones," reported the monitor, Takuya Hirayama, of Clandestine Radio Watch Japan. The station identifies itself in Arabic as "Idha'at Radiyo Al-Ma'ulumat," and occasionally as "Masdar Ma'ulumatikum, Idha'at Radiyo al-Ma'ulumat" (Your Source of Information, Information Radio). 
<br>
<br>Hirayama's record of the broadcasts included a profile of Egyptian born International Atomic Energy Agency Director, Dr. Mohamed el-Baradei, a report on the US military exercise 'Internal Look' to test the ability of US command and control teams to relocate to the Middle East, and a repeat of President George W. Bush and United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan's comments on the Iraq situation on November 8. 
<br>
<br>Follows, some selections from the transcripts. 
<br>
<br>16:00 hrs: An announcer concludes his remarks: "...dear listeners, every member of the United Nations Security Council voted in favour of United Nations Security Resolution 1441 on November 8th, 2002. The unanimity of the vote is evidence that the United Nations is unwavering in its resolve to see Saddam Hussein's regime disarmed in a peaceful manner. UNSCR 1441 has clearly strengthened the cause of peace throughout the world. We can only hope that Saddam Hussein seizes the opportunity to begin the end of the isolation and suffering that his non-compliance with past UN resolutions has brought on the Iraqi people." 
<br>
<br>16:14: Song by an Iraqi female pop singer. 
<br>
<br>16:19: Station identification read by female announcer. 
<br>
<br>16:20: Another song by an Iraqi female pop singer. 
<br>
<br>16:26: Celine Dion sings the theme song from Titanic 
<br>
<br>16:30: Station identification read by female announcer. "Your source of Information, Information Radio" (Masdar Ma'ulumatikum, Idha'at Radiyo al-Ma'ulumat) 1631- Song by an Iraqi male pop singer. 
<br>
<br>16:37: Station identification read by a male announcer followed by a reading by a female announcer: "People of Iraq. Throughout the history of the world, mankind has shown a desire to progress and expand. Great leaders have built vast civilizations and empires that spanned continents. These leaders have sponsored education programs, paved vast roads, and built housing for the less fortunate. The leaders of the past have turned deserts into arable land, and created innovations which made life easier for their people. 
<br>
<br>"The great leaders of the past are known for their generosity and charity towards their own people, as well as their neighbouring lands. In Afghanistan, once the Taleban was removed from power, the standard of living drastically improved. Relief aid is pouring into Afghanistan and is appropriately distributed. Schools are open and people all across Afghanistan are better off. 
<br>
<br>"However, there have been leaders who were not moved by charity and good will. These leaders were motivated solely by greed and power. Josef Stalin was one such leader. Stalin was set on world domination, and it was his regime that began nearly a half-century of brutal domination through Eastern Europe. Stalin oppressed his people as he ruled over his country with an iron fist. 
<br>
<br>"During his reign as a dictator, Stalin killed and imprisoned millions of his own people. Millions of others were forcefully displaced and ended up living many miles away from their own homes. This dictator cared nothing for his own people, he merely sought to exploit them to perpetuate his regime and flawed ideology. 
<br>
<br>"In the end, the world has paid a higher price for not stopping men like Stalin when they had the chance. Many millions of people have lost their lives needlessly under these oppressive regimes and in wars started by these leaders. The loss of life and the needless suffering could have been minimized had action been taken sooner. 
<br>
<br>"History has shown that appeasement of brutal domineering regimes only brings greater tragedy. Saddam too has a lust for power, and the world will stand up and put an end to the terror he imposes on others, before he destroys Iraq and crushes the hopes of its proud people." 
<br>
<br>16:39: Song by an Iraqi female pop singer.
