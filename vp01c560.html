Winning CNN Wars<br><br>FRANK J. STECH<br><br><br><br>From Parameters, Autumn 1994, pp. 37-56 <br><br><A HREF="http://carlisle-www.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/1994/stech.htm"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=http://carlisle-www.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/1994/stech.htm></A><br><br><br><br>On the night the Gulf War air attack began, a senior officer in the Pentagon Command Center, watching the TV<br>transmissions from Baghdad, checked his watch and consulted those planning the air attack on the Iraqi central<br>telecommunications tower: "If the cruise missile is on target . . . the reporter will go off the air right about . . . (he counts<br>down the seconds) . . . Now!"[1] ABC and NBC network reports from Baghdad, routed through the Iraqi communications<br>network, went dead. CNN reports continued, carried over a dedicated telephone circuit to Jordan installed before the air<br>attacks. <br><br>For more than two weeks CNN provided the only American reporting from Iraq. CNN's coverage of the Gulf War was<br>unique and completely redefined live satellite television news.[2] The Gulf War opened the possibility that new forms of<br>war and diplomacy were being born. "Television imagery transmitted by satellite," wrote one observer, "is irrevocably<br>altering the ways governments deal with each other, just as it makes traditional diplomacy all but obsolete in times of crisis.<br>. . . Instant access from the battlefield to the conference table and back again has enormous political implications both good<br>and bad."[3] The TV coverage of the Gulf War created a phenomenon that has come to be termed "CNN war."[4] <br><br>The unique experience of real-time feedback at war's outbreak from the opponent's national capital offers a useful place to<br>start thinking about conflict in the global TV age. Radio, invented near the turn of the 19th century, led to new arsenals of<br>electronic weaponry that radically changed military operations three decades later. Radio technology spawned new<br>approaches to strategy (propaganda, strategic bombing), operations (navigation, electronic warfare), and tactics (mobile<br>communications and improved command and control).[5] Television, invented in the 1920s, began a similar cycle of<br>innovation and adaptation in military operations in the 1970s, leading to the weaponry of the 1990s and beyond. TV and<br>video are poised to change warfare as extensively and dramatically in the 21st century as radio changed conflict in this<br>century, for policymakers as well as for combatants. To think of video as exclusively the province of the media would be as<br>shortsighted today as thinking in 1930 that radio was merely for news broadcasts. The effects of TV, video, and global<br>communications on conflict management in the 21st century will extend far beyond the relationships of TV news and the<br>military. CNN war provides the first and clearest signs, however, of the implications of global TV for national policymaking<br>and military operations.[6] <br><br>Real-time video on the battlefield and images of conflict transmitted by satellite to TVs around the world already have<br>altered government decisionmaking and military operations in several ways. TV news carries information directly and<br>immediately to top leaders, bypassing the entire apparatus of intelligence, diplomacy, and national security. "I learn more<br>from CNN than I do from the CIA," President Bush told other world leaders; his press secretary observed, "In most of these<br>kinds of international crises now, we virtually cut out the State Department and the desk officers. . . . Their reports are still<br>important, but they don't get here in time for the basic decisions to be made."[7] Images of Patriot missiles intercepting<br>Scuds in the night skies of Tel Aviv helped dissuade the Israeli government from attacking Iraq and fracturing the Gulf War<br>coalition. Wrote one observer, "Patriot was given center stage on television for a significant part of the Gulf War, having a<br>magical effect on the public's perception of events."[8] <br><br>TV viewers, including leaders, react emotionally and forcefully to images, and public pressure forces policymakers to<br>respond quickly; President Clinton's advisor George Stephanopoulis has noted, "In the White House . . . we have 24-hour<br>news cycles. . . . CNN assures that you are forced to react at any time, and that's going to happen throughout the time of the<br>Clinton presidency."[9] Everything speeds up, and emotion competes with reason: "There's really no time to digest this<br>information," observed one senior advisor, "so the reaction tends to be from the gut, just like the reaction of the man on the<br>street. . . . High-level people are being forced essentially to act or to formulate responses or policy positions on the basis of<br>information that is of very uncertain reliability."[10] The image of a single American helicopter pilot being dragged through<br>the streets of Mogadishu almost immediately caused the Clinton Administration to announce the withdrawal of US forces<br>from Somalia. Leaders communicate directly to each other through CNN and shape events through a dialogue of images:<br>"You end up hearing statements for the first time," President Bush said, "not in diplomatic notes, but because you see a<br>foreign minister on the screen. I really mean CNN. It has turned out to be a very important information source."[11] The<br>House Foreign Affairs Committee recently held hearings on whether media coverage influences foreign policy and forces<br>hasty judgments and decisions. <br><br>The concerns are many. CNN war leads publics and leaders to define political events in terms of the video clips and sound<br>bites that compose TV news images. Conflicts that fail to generate good video fail to be politically real: "What I'm<br>concerned about is what happens in the non-CNN wars," observed UN Ambassador Madeleine Albright, mentioning crises<br>in Angola, Sudan, Mozambique, and Ngorno-Karabakh -- "Those are not on CNN. The question is how the international<br>community deals with that."[12] Through CNN "everyone is seeing the same thing": publics see events when leaders and<br>elites see them, as they happen, and "for the first time in history, the rich and poor, literate and illiterate, city worker and<br>peasant farmer are linked together by shared images of global life," joined through "a hot line from self to self."[13]<br>Spectators become participants while participants in televised events become spectators: soldiers in the Gulf War, watching<br>TV, saw the folks back home watching the soldiers, watching the folks, watching. . . . <br><br>In January 1994 Yassar Arafat addressed, via CNN, crowds of Palestinian demonstrators, who in turn conversed, through<br>the on-scene reporter, with Arafat, both sides watching themselves in dialogue. TV images become directly tied to political<br>mobilization because "satellites have no respect for political boundaries, they cannot be stopped by Berlin Walls, by tanks<br>in Tiananmen Square, or by dictators in Baghdad," and watching becomes participation.[14] Political groups "capture"<br>images that serve their purposes and reuse them, creating new events to be televised. News media compete to broadcast<br>dramatic events, which are repeated and echoed from one news channel to others, until supplanted by newer images.<br>Consequently, the media emphasize event coverage, exclusiveness, and distribution of images rather than the quality, nuance,<br>substance, and interpretation of news content.[15] <br><br>Given these concerns and the characteristics of real-time video, globally broadcast live from the battlefield, what can<br>policymakers and military leaders do to adapt their policies, strategies, campaign plans, and tactics to support their goals in<br>a CNN war? The remainder of this article examines the persuasiveness of video images, how leaders have employed images<br>to gain support for their goals, and recent perspectives on CNN war and Pentagon-media relations. It concludes by<br>suggesting ways to win CNN wars. <br><br>The Psychology and Sociology of Visual Persuasion <br><br>Modern scientific studies of persuasion began around the time of World War II, motivated in part by the widespread use of<br>propaganda by warring nations, subsequently reinforced by fears of "brainwashing," communist and otherwise. These early<br>studies focused on context: message and channel characteristics (for example, whether the message used emotional appeals,<br>or stressed one side or two sides of an issue) and the characteristics of the communicator and the audience (expertise of the<br>communicator, attitudes of the audience, similarity of the communicator to the audience).[16] More recent studies of<br>persuasion examine the interpersonal dynamics of the communication relationship: reciprocity, commitment, deference,<br>liking, scarcity.[17] <br><br>Images and interactive dialogues, key elements of CNN war, have not been the focal points for the sociological and<br>psychological analysis of persuasion. Scientists cannot inform us how to dominate every political debate, make every TV<br>program a hit, or sell refrigerators to every Eskimo. They have no touchstone tactics for winning every CNN war. The<br>analysis of persuasion nevertheless provides some useful suggestions for our involvement in future CNN wars. Some<br>psychological guidelines for persuasive communication:[18] <br><br>    Two-sided messages are better than one-sided messages for persuading neutral or opposed audiences. <br>    The rhetorical structure of persuasive messages affects their persuasiveness. <br>    Vivid messages (e.g., video) are more convincing when the communicator has high credibility and the message is<br>    simple. <br>    Case studies or examples are more persuasive than statistical facts. <br>    Communicators are perceived as credible if they seem safe (kind, friendly, and just), qualified (trained, experienced,<br>    and informed), and dynamic (bold, active, and energetic). <br>    Film (or video) messages are markedly effective (and preferred to less vivid media) in teaching factual knowledge, are<br>    accepted as accurate, and are not perceived as propaganda. <br>    Emotional (fear-inducing) appeals are persuasive when they are truly frightful, suggest effective actions to reduce the<br>    fear-arousing threat, and the recipients believe that they are able to perform the suggested action. <br><br>Great leaders often have advised that compelling speeches generate vivid, emotion-laden images.[19] Churchill's "iron<br>curtain" image galvanized America's response to the Soviet threat the British statesman pronounced in 1946.[20]<br>Communicators who depart from a prepared text and speak "from the heart" are perceived as more committed and<br>persuasive, and extemporaneous speech is often recommended by orators for rhetorical effect.[21] Coretta Scott King<br>described how her husband, Martin Luther King, Jr., delivered his famous I Have a Dream speech in 1963 on the steps of<br>the Lincoln Memorial: <br><br>    Abandoning his written speech, forgetting time, he spoke from his heart, his voice soaring magnificently out over<br>    that great crowd and to all the world. It seemed to all of us there that day that his words flowed from some higher<br>    place, through Martin, to the weary people before him.[22] <br><br>People like pictures, and the believability of video makes pictures more convincing than words: moving pictures "seem<br>utterly real" wrote Walter Lippmann in 1922.[23] People tend to believe what they see on video as positive proof. To make<br>pictures more appealing, advertisers instruct, use familiar scenes with likable people showing favorable associations, and<br>avoid anything challenging strong moral conventions. The viewer should not feel a need to change much in the picture. The<br>viewer should perceive in the picture a promise that his or her desires will be fulfilled. The picture should contain, wrote<br>advertiser Stephen Baker, "a desirable model for the viewer to be."[24] Alexis de Tocqueville never imagined television,<br>but his comments offer provocative ideas on crafting persuasive video images. He wrote that American cultural products<br>"substitute the representation of motion and sensation for that of sentiment and thought. . . . [The] style will frequently be<br>fantastic, incorrect, overburdened, and loose, almost always vehement and bold."[25] <br><br>Sociologists advise that compelling video messages must be crafted into the framework of the television news media.[26]<br>The credible news frame defines the characteristics of believable news stories: reports must have subframes that are<br>personalized, dramatized, fragmented, and normalized.[27] News media focus on a personalized actor subframe--individual<br>leaders, spokespersons, exemplars of the political actions.[28] Media images convey a dramatized story subframe:<br>beginnings, action style, plot lines and sub-plots, settings and scenery, rising and falling action, major and minor actors with<br>major and minor motives, climax and anti-climax, and endings that close with a chorus (journalists, politicians, experts, the<br>public, or all four) interpreting the moral lessons of the drama.[29] News images are episodic, isolated in time and space<br>from each other, and unable to represent all aspects and all periods of events, falling inside a fragmented, latest<br>development subframe.[30] Images and events speak for themselves in isolation, without context, absent trends or<br>progressions, often without causes to explain effects, lacking any reflection of connectivities and interdependencies.[31] The<br>credible, objective news frame dictates a normalized, official sources subframe to provide the last, authoritative word on<br>interpretation of events.[32] <br><br>When leaders are unable to sort out these subframes and fit political events and images into credible news frames (e.g., the<br>chaos of Marines intervening in Lebanon, the Islamic revolution in Iran, racial politics in South Africa), media coverage<br>loses its coherent story line, misidentifies actors, and scrambles the latest developments into perplexing, pointless mysteries.<br>The resulting media images show the darker sides of CNN war (a destroyed Marine barracks, American diplomats taken<br>hostage, race riots and terrorism), and reflect the bafflement of official sources lacking coherent frameworks for their actions<br>and policies. In time of war, the official sources subframe becomes even more dominant. Media deviation from official<br>sources might compromise security, provide aid and comfort to the enemy, divulge military secrets, or simply get the story<br>wrong. Because the military and the government are also jealous of their images and the justness of their cause, war shifts<br>the credible news frame much more toward the official sources subframe and generates persistent friction in the<br>media-military relationship. <br><br>The credible news frame and subframes describe in workable terms the circumstances that create believable content in<br>political news images. The requirements for creating or influencing media images, thus mediating political realities, become<br>fairly clear. No matter how logical the calculus that led to a policy, without a clear and coherent story frame for that policy,<br>there is little hope of building public understanding or support. "If an administration has thought its own foreign policy<br>through and is prepared and able to argue the merits and defend the consequences of that policy, television and all its new<br>technologies can be dealt with," one TV anchor advised the House Foreign Affairs Committee.[33] Psychological guidelines<br>and sociological frames offer some tactical foundations for supporting policies in future CNN wars. Tactics are important,<br>as recent events show. <br><br>Somalia and CNN War Image Exploitation <br><br>Foreign policy experts were harsh in their assessments of President Clinton's quick shift of US Somalia policy after the<br>broadcast of images from the Rangers' fight in Mogadishu. Clinton's willingness to negotiate, rather than continue efforts to<br>capture the warlord Aidid, was criticized as weakness, sending the wrong signals. "We have no interest in denying anybody<br>access to playing a role in Somalia's political future," the President was quoted the week after the attack on the Rangers.<br>That shift was exactly wrong, commented former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who argued that failing to strike back<br>virtually guaranteed that the wrong lesson would be learned. The world's other mischief-makers will have no fear, Kissinger<br>warned, unless the United States reduces Aidid's "power base so that it's apparent that when you tackle the US in the brutal<br>way in which it has been done there is a penalty."[34] Kissinger offered a realpolitik perspective on the tactics of<br>"mischief-makers." Futurist Chuck de Caro offered a media-oriented perspective--the Somalia crisis, amplified through<br>global TV imagery, enabled other "mischief-makers" to create TV news images for their own purposes: <br><br>    A tenth-rate tin-pot Haitian dictator using global TV as a C3I mechanism judges the likely reaction of the United<br>    States in the wake of . . . the video of Rangers being killed and mutilated in Somalia. He optimizes his mil-pol<br>    moves to retard US intervention by having a handful of rabble go to a dock [and] mug-angrily-on-cue for global<br>    TV. He thus turns away a US warship (albeit on a UN mission) with nothing more than the video of an alleged<br>    angry mob that generates the perception of imminent bloodshed that is projected and amplified by TV. Matters are<br>    made worse by the perception of the US LST retreating from the scene.[35] <br><br>US policymakers and military leaders failed to convey to the public the reasons for shifting US goals and missions in<br>Somalia, or the possible consequences of the changing relations with the UN and with the warlords. There had been<br>insufficient warnings to foreshadow the growing Somali hostility to the UN, or the buildup to events of this magnitude.[36]<br>Media stories failed to link the complexities of US-UN disagreements, Somali warlord politics, tensions between military<br>peacekeepers and non-governmental aid organizations (many vigorously pacifist), and shifting US missions. The<br>Administration offered no credible news frames for the secret operations of the Rangers, offered no immediate public<br>eulogies to redeem their losses, and failed to link the hunt for Aidid to the larger relief and stability operations.[37] When<br>the Rangers' mission turned into open, bloody conflict with Aidid's Mogadishu militia, there was no public opinion<br>foundation for what happened or why. Rather than representing the gun battle as the climax of a policy that had gone astray,<br>but was now being put back on track, the Administration was left without a coherent explanation of the catastrophe and<br>seemed to have no clear policy goals in Somalia. The horror and seeming pointlessness of the Rangers' deaths challenged the<br>US Somali presence in the public's mind.[38] <br><br>If the Clinton Administration was unprepared for the images of the debacle in Mogadishu's streets, it quickly used them to<br>restore some stability.[39] "Penalties" and "reducing power bases," Kissinger's realpolitik levers of power, become less<br>significant than perceptions of these things. The critics of the Administration's response to the Somali CNN war were right<br>about its negative effects on US reactions. When events went bad, the Clinton Administration lacked credible news frames<br>for the images and perceptions. Faced with the darker side of CNN war, it was unready to defend policies and events which<br>formed no coherent story. The outcome of the Rangers' fight was militarily insignificant; the TV images and lack of a media<br>plan to explain Administration policies made the losses politically overwhelming. <br><br>Yet planning explanations of policies and actions using the guidelines for persuasive and credible news frames is not<br>enough. Events in CNN war do not unfold as monologues, but in dialogues, with allies, neutrals, and opponents. Preparing<br>for CNN wars requires a readiness to hear and respond to the voices and images of others, shaping messages into cogent<br>harmony with perceptions of these dialogues. Just as greatness in battle requires an instinctive eye for the interplay of terrain<br>and opposing forces, campaigns in CNN war require a coup d'oeil for the images juste, an instinctive ability to incorporate<br>compelling images in support of political and military goals. History and recent events offer suggestive examples of such<br>operational art. <br><br>Signs, Symbols, and Presidential Semiotics <br><br>Leaders seek compelling signs and engaging symbols to tell the public the stories behind their policies and actions; they<br>practice the "semiotic" creation of reality.[40] Signs are composed of sounds and images, and the concepts these images<br>represent. Images of things (e.g., a carefree Mickey Mouse) become the signs of something else (life in free societies), and<br>serve as "combat graphics" on the campaign maps of CNN war. <br><br>Presidents have long used audience involvement, cultural symbols, and images to their advantage in telling their stories.<br>During World War II President Roosevelt communicated the course of the fighting to the nation over the national radio<br>networks during his "fireside chats." He suggested that listeners buy maps in order to follow along with him the paths of the<br>advancing Allied forces, and he referred them to the images in newsreels, Life, Saturday Evening Post, Time, and the other<br>media of the day. Besides stoking the already voracious appetites for news of the war, his suggestions generated a national<br>flurry of map-buying, a significant increase in the geographic sophistication of the nation, and a personal feeling of<br>involvement in the course of the war.[41] Roosevelt was adept at weaving semiographic signs from mass culture into his<br>persuasive political Weltanschauung. For example, when Colonel Jimmy Doolittle flew Army bombers off Navy aircraft<br>carriers against Tokyo, Roosevelt whimsically preserved security and added to the propaganda effect by identifying the<br>aviators' base as "Shangri-La," referring to the mythical locale in a popular novel and movie.[42] Roosevelt also capitalized<br>on the timely appearance of the film Casablanca to reinforce his policies toward Vichy France and the Free French,<br>celebrate the North African landings as a victory, anchor public commitment to the war, and boost his own stature.[43] <br><br>The Gulf War duel between Saddam Hussein's Scud ballistic missiles and President Bush's Patriot missiles created an<br>interactive dialogue of images, which fitted precisely the credible news frame. First the dramatic initial panic: did the Scuds<br>carry chemical warheads?[44] Then the diplomatic crisis: would Israel retaliate and split Bush's fragile, carefully crafted<br>Gulf coalition?[45] "Saddam . . . had started a war of imagery: the gas masks, the rubble, the frantic reporters," a history of<br>the war summarized, and "the coalition countered with its own captivating imagery: the Patriot in action."[46 <br><br>The world watched the TV debut of the "bullet that hits a bullet."[47] One after another of Iraq's vaunted Scuds were visibly<br>destroyed by the spectacular Patriot interceptors: coalition high-tech dominating Saddam's crude terror weapon. President<br>Bush, televised at the Raytheon Patriot factory, claimed 41 out of 42 Patriots hit their targets. The Patriots helped keep the<br>Israeli war machine out of the Gulf War, and thus the coalition held together. Only a handful of Arab nations expressed any<br>support for Iraq's Scud campaign; most condemned Saddam's attacks on his Saudi brothers. Saddam lost the dialogue of<br>images.[48] The political and psychological consequences of images of Patriot and Scud dueling in the desert night skies<br>provide a classic example of presidential semiotics and operational art in CNN war.[49] <br><br>The use of images, cultural symbols, even fantasies (for example, myths about the founding fathers, or films about historic<br>events) to create or reinforce the realities that they signify has strong psychological roots as well as significant political<br>efficacy.[50] These shorthand signifiers help us understand and conceptualize what might otherwise seem chaotic. French<br>President Mitterrand, filmed walking through the rubble of besieged Sarajevo, helped his countrymen understand why France<br>supplied most of Bosnia's UN peacekeepers. The heavily watched 1994 Winter Olympics TV coverage contrasted scenes of<br>Olympic- village-pristine Sarajevo in 1984 with contemporary scenes of war-ravaged Sarejevo's mangled bodies and<br>buildings; viewers saw Sarejevo's weary civilians watching themselves watching the televised contrasts. These compelling<br>images reinforced the shock effect of scenes of the marketplace casualties of a Serbian mortar attack; they could have helped<br>coalesce US support for tougher NATO and UN policies toward the Bosnian Serbs. <br><br>In the era of CNN wars, leaders and the public play out political fantasies on a stage of televised realities. Late-breaking<br>video news sustains our involvement and opportunities to interact with the images (if only vicariously) and thus maintains<br>our participation. We decide our loyalties and commitments against image backdrops of ongoing events: testimony of Iraqi<br>soldiers stealing incubators and leaving Kuwaiti babies to die, Patriot missiles destroying Scuds, Yeltsin atop a Soviet tank,<br>dead Ranger heroes being desecrated. We can fancy ourselves in our own TV versions of Casablanca, living amidst wars,<br>coups, and revolutions, and we decide to support (or not) real heroes, causes, and sides. To use the dialogue of images in the<br>operations of future CNN wars, then, is to lead with image-filled stories, shaped around the TV scenes we all see--to<br>provide compelling pictures formed with persuasive signs and symbols. <br><br>Perspectives on CNN War <br><br>Military analysts have foreshadowed many of the issues of CNN war.[51] The implications and requirements of the<br>information age increasingly influence national military policy planning. The 1991 Bush Administration's National Security<br>Strategy of the United States noted: <br><br>    Recent history has shown how much ideas count. The Cold War was, in its decisive aspect, a war of ideas. But<br>    ideas count only when knowledge spreads. . . . In the face of the global explosion of information . . . ideas and<br>    information will take on larger significance. . . . A truly global community is being formed.[52] <br><br>The final National Security Strategy produced by that Administration carried the point further: "Our influence will<br>increasingly be defined more by the quality of our ideas, values, and leadership . . . than by the predominance of our military<br>capabilities."[53] Clinton-era defense planning embodies the demands of CNN war in its assumptions: <br><br>    In this era of almost instant communication, the demands on US military forces seem almost endless, as the<br>    pictures of human misery from around the globe compete for air-time. . . . America must pursue political,<br>    economic, and military engagement internationally. . . . Around the world, America's power, authority, and<br>    example provide unparalleled opportunities to lead.[54] <br><br>The need for new ways to conduct military operations in the age of video and information has begun to appear in think-tank<br>studies. The authors of The Military Technical Revolution call on US military forces to be prepared to "fight a CNN war."<br>They write of this requirement: <br><br>    US forces must be capable of responding to media demands for instantaneous information, and of using the rapid<br>    transmission of data to its advantage. This magnifies the importance of tending to image considerations. . . . But<br>    it also suggests the need for greater information dominance and for some thought about how modern, real-time<br>    news reporting can be used to US advantage in future military operations.[55] <br><br>Despite the attentions of the White House, the assumptions of the Pentagon, and the insights of the think-tanks, military<br>theorists seem remarkably slow in addressing the implications of CNN war for military operations. Although the service<br>war colleges have launched research programs and symposia on the subject of "the media and the military," the focus is<br>largely on the relationships between these institutions, rather than the challenge to explore ways in which "image<br>considerations" and "real-time news reporting" might be used to advantage in future military operations. The war college<br>analyses seem to reflect a "glass half-empty" view of media effects on military operations; at best the media represent a<br>necessary evil for commanders to deal with, rather than an opportunity to gain military advantages.[56] Even those analysts<br>who recognize the potential interplay of video news reporting and military psychological operations seem to favor a<br>coercive rather than a cooperative approach.[57] It is also remarkable that so few lessons in the use of media assets seem to<br>have been drawn from the internal overthrow of the communist regimes of east Europe or the dissolution of the Soviet<br>empire. <br><br>The Pentagon and the Media <br><br>While many writers have addressed media-military relations in the wake of the 1990-91 Gulf War, these analysts have not<br>addressed the issues of CNN war. To date this commentary has emphasized the standoff between the press, demanding<br>openness from the military authorities, and the Pentagon, requiring control over the press (and getting it to a great extent,<br>along with public approval). Several observers have faulted the Pentagon's media strategy during the Gulf War. One writes<br>that the White House and the Pentagon followed a deliberate policy of blocking negative and unflattering news from reaching<br>the US public lest it weaken support for the war. This account notes that other observers argued that press restrictions went<br>beyond security concerns and appeared to be aimed at preventing damaging disclosures by US soldiers, thus shielding the<br>American public from the brutality of war.[58] <br><br>Another commentator, discussing Pentagon-media relations at an October 1991 MIT symposium on "Reporting the Gulf<br>War," noted the consistent bias of Army officers against the media. The speaker pointed out how Army censors delayed<br>releasing news stories they feared would generate adverse publicity, which got the stories spiked by deadline-driven<br>editors, but consequently generated bad feelings between the Army and press reporters. In so doing, the Army allegedly<br>missed a tremendous opportunity to use the press to show the American public how well the Army performed in the desert<br>war. In contrast, the speaker noted, Marines in the Gulf, headed by a former Public Affairs Officer, Lieutenant General<br>Walter Boomer, went out of their way to be open and to assist the press, which contributed to extremely positive press<br>coverage.[59] Further, the Marines seemed to have fully incorporated the press in their Gulf War campaign of information<br>dominance.[60] A Marine Corps representative, speaking at the MIT Symposium, argued that the press coverage acted as a<br>Marine Corps "force multiplier" by keeping Marines motivated and keeping US and world opinion firmly behind the<br>Marines. As a result, noted MIT's Trevor Thrall: "The Marine Corps, and not the Army, received a disproportionate share of<br>good PR from the war, even though it was the Army which was responsible for the bulk of the fighting, including the critical<br>`Hail Mary' [General Schwarzkopf's flanking of Iraqi forces in the western desert]."[61] <br><br>A recent Air University thesis argues that "media spin" has become a new principle of war.[62] Media spin is defined as<br>"paying close attention to public relations, recognizing that public support is an essential ingredient of combat success." The<br>military must not take media coverage of combat operations for granted, and should avoid operations that will alienate<br>public support, while ensuring maximum media coverage of success stories: "In an age where 24-hour instantaneous<br>battlefield news coverage is a fact of life," the thesis argues, "paying attention to media spin is of paramount importance; for<br>a combat commander, anything less would be irresponsible." That writer, like many military observers, sees a clash<br>between the media and the military as a zero-sum game, where the military wins by keeping secrets, and the media wins by<br>revealing them. Public relations concerns do affect military decisions, but the "media spin" approach to the public and the<br>press defines manipulative, adversarial relations.[63] Other military analysts see the military-media relationship in more<br>cooperative and collaborative perspectives. <br><br>The US Army War College's Strategic Studies Institute recently conducted an analysis of the effects of the media's<br>technological advances on policymaking, military planning, and strategic decisions.[64] The study noted, "There is no longer<br>a question of whether the news media will cover military operations; journalists will likely precede the force into the area<br>of operation, and they will transmit images of events as they happen, perhaps from both sides of any conflict." The author of<br>this study, in contrast to the "media spin" approach, saw the need for (and the benefits of) a proactive, "well resourced and<br>responsive" military infrastructure to work with the media and assist their news-gathering, without impairing military<br>operations.[65] This study clearly reflects the most serious consequences of CNN wars, when media coverage of military<br>operations directly influences higher levels of policy and decisionmaking: <br><br>    Under the scrutiny of a very responsive, high technology world news media, given the volatile, unstable, and<br>    ambiguous environment in which armed forces can find themselves, the actions of field forces have a greater<br>    chance than ever before of affecting subsequent strategic decisions made at higher levels. The pressure on field<br>    commanders to "get it right the first time" is demonstrably greater than ever.[66] <br><br>Clearly, the military must help the political leadership by ensuring that the rationale and justification for military operations<br>are completely consistent with policy objectives, and by helping policymakers explain to the public and press the<br>connections between operations and policy. <br><br>To Win CNN Wars <br><br>Advice on CNN war has focused more on "coping" than on "winning" and tends to echo a warning by Winston Churchill:<br>"Nothing is more dangerous in wartime than to live in the temperamental atmosphere of a Gallup Poll, always feeling one's<br>pulse and taking one's temperature."[67] There is a growing chorus blaming bad US foreign policy on CNN images: when<br>the images get to us emotionally (and through us, to our leaders), these critics argue, we make mistakes, intervening<br>militarily where our vital national interests are not involved. Episodes like Somalia or the intervention in Lebanon, the<br>chorus argues, occur because shocking images got under our skin and overruled rational national reasoning. "Foreign policy<br>by CNN," one critic warns, "may be psychologically satisfying, but it is very dangerous. Our record of interventions<br>provoked by guilt-inducing pictures is an unhappy one."[68] "The eye, fastened to CNN," writes another: <br><br>    makes a valuable witness. But it has a tendency to stir people to bursts of indignation that flare briefly,<br>    spectacularly and ineffectually, like a fire splashed with a cup of gasoline. An advertent and sustained foreign<br>    policy uses a different part of the brain from the one engaged by horrifying images.[69] <br><br>Foreign policy success, these critics reason, occurs because our leaders make cold, dispassionate assessments of<br>geopolitical national interests: "The Persian Gulf War was not provoked by pictures. . . . We were galvanized not by<br>emotion but by cold calculation."[70] The solution these critics offer is to ignore the pictures and equate US vital interests<br>with classic realpolitik realities: oil, military power balance, narrow economic and political self-interests. The "cold<br>calculation" view seemingly rejects American causes based on law, justice, or humanitarianism. Historically, the critics'<br>logic is wholly hindsightful. Sending Marines into Lebanon or Somalia, at the outset, rested on US influence and leadership,<br>just as did sending the Marines into monsoon-ravaged Bangladesh (Operation Sea Angel), sending the Green Berets into<br>Iraqi Kurdistan (Provide Comfort), or even sending forces to take back Kuwait. When body bags came back, however, some<br>critics professed to see a lack of national interests, and feckless policies prompted by images. <br><br>The observation that focusing policy through the filter of the news sometimes courts disaster provides no fresh insight.<br>Walter Lippmann, in his 1922 classic Public Opinion, wrote: <br><br>    The press . . . is like the beam of a searchlight that moves restlessly about, bringing one episode and then another<br>    out of darkness into vision. Men cannot do the work of the world by this light alone. They cannot govern society by<br>    episodes, incidents, and eruptions. . . . News and truth are not the same. . . . The function of news is to signalize an<br>    event, the function of truth is to bring to light the hidden facts, to set them in relation with each other, and make a<br>    picture of reality on which men can act. When we expect [news] to supply . . . truth . . . we misunderstand the<br>    limited nature of news, the illimitable complexity of society; we overestimate our own endurance, public spirit,<br>    and all-round competence.[71] <br><br>Lippmann saw remedies in a social organization based on "analysis and record" (boring though it may be), decentralization<br>of decisions, "abandonment of the theory of the omnicompetent," coordination among decisionmakers, and a "running audit"<br>of situations to prevent governance by episode. He recognized that the resultant errors of setting policy on a news<br>foundation, of acting "without a reliable picture of the world," could be offset only by "inventing, creating, and organizing a<br>machinery of knowledge." A more contemporary critic believes the solution lies in "leadership and a strength of resolve that<br>allows principle and conviction to ride over the often ill-formed media criticism and the snapshot reporting."[72] <br><br>If the critics of CNN-driven policy sometimes have trouble recollecting the sources of national interests, they are right about<br>the potentially dangerous consequences of policy development and military operations in reaction to images and snapshot<br>reporting, without analysis, planning, or readiness. Among the dilemmas of CNN war is this: the government machinery<br>(e.g., the intelligence and policy staffs) suggested by Lippmann's advice tends to be bypassed and ignored; we should not be<br>surprised if this machinery fails to help leaders fight and win CNN wars. One approach taken by the managers of that<br>government machinery has been to become more like CNN. The Central Intelligence Agency technical staff, under Director<br>Robert Gates, was working on "advanced delivery systems" to get to policymakers DIA products "that combine . . databased<br>information, graphics, even video." Similarly, the Defense Intelligence Agency consulted with CNN on how to coordinate<br>and integrate reports into coherent and interactive communications with their clients.[73] <br><br>What these CNN imitators must remember is that simply knowing something, and helping policymakers and commanders to<br>become aware, is not enough. Leadership needs more than advice and information. Providing leaders "a reliable picture of<br>the world" helps only if they are able to use that picture persuasively to communicate their vision of outcomes. The<br>"government knowledge machinery" that supports the leadership must be ready to prepare both information and compelling<br>communications as quickly, readily, and flexibly as CNN provides news video and analysis. Providing this level of support<br>to leaders presents significant organizational, technical, and intellectual challenges. The biggest obstacle, however, is<br>philosophical: the sentiment that the solution to the problems of CNN wars is to "turn out the lights"; to get the CNN<br>spotlights pointed elsewhere, dimmed, switched off. Or, if you are a policymaker, to turn your back on them. <br><br>The "cold calculation" critics, who argue that US foreign policy is too motivated by CNN, crassly imply that shocking<br>images are the only motivations for "do-good" policies. "True national interests," according to the realpolitik perspective,<br>reflect unemotional, geopolitical realities. If these critics are right, US national interests may be very difficult to defend in<br>future CNN wars: they would reflect a cold, calculated, negative image of US self-interest. As noted previously, the Bush<br>Administration got it right when it emphasized "the quality of our ideas, values, and leadership" rather than our undoubtedly<br>dominant military capabilities.[74] Future CNN wars, like the Persian Gulf War, will require US policymakers to see that<br>the quality of our ideas and values is given proper weight in developing policy. Those wars will require military leaders to<br>reflect the human ideas and values of our national interests in our operations. If our policies fail to reflect a human face, if<br>the cold calculations of our leaders envision no compelling stories of human values, then in a world of CNN war the force of<br>public support and the favor of public opinion for those policies will be questionable at best.[75] The human face of our<br>policies becomes part of our arsenal, and the force of the stories of our ideas and values becomes the core of US power.[76]<br><br>When political leaders have sent the military into harm's way, it does not matter to those in the conflict if our policies are<br>rooted in the programmed political intentions of a cold calculus of realpolitik, or if they are compelled by humane values in<br>response to CNN images. Once the commitment is made and the soldiers go, the minicams will be there, and we must<br>prepare the troops for the roll (and the role) of the CNN video. If policymakers and military leaders hold no vision of the<br>human face of our commitments, if they tell no stories from the heart of the how and why of our military actions, then others<br>will do it for them, and the results may not be to their liking. <br><br>There is, however, one lesson at this early phase of discovery about CNN war that policymakers and military commanders,<br>and those who would advise and inform them, should learn. They must communicate the goals of policies and the objectives<br>of military operations clearly and simply enough so that the widest of audiences can envision the ways and the means being<br>used to reach those goals. This understanding needs to extend from the President down to the average citizen and the most<br>junior soldier. The operational ways and means must be clear and simple--how the operation is happening--so individuals<br>can understand how they personally are being affected. The policy goals and motives for the operation need to be equally<br>clear and simple, but also compelling, so that citizens and allies alike will want to be a part of these operations, while our<br>adversaries will feel powerless to escape the inevitable outcome if they oppose our goals. If policymakers and military<br>leaders draw these pictures and convey this strategic understanding, they should have little fear of video on the battlefields<br>of future CNN wars. The operations, tactics, and images of future CNN wars will follow from these visions. Soldiers,<br>civilians, even enemies, will know why and how we do what we must. We can let them tell the story. And that is how to win<br>CNN wars. <br><br><br>NOTES are in a separate file<br><br><br><br>
