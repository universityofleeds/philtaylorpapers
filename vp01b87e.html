Within ten minutes<br>	of you turning up, I finished the cheeze and moved on to the coffee<br>	and cigars. And at this late stage, I'm in a cab with two lady com-<br>	panions on my way to the Pink Pussycat in Lower Regency.<br><br>George: Oh well, because if you are cheezed off, you know what would cheer<br>	you up, alot of Charlie Chaplin films. Oh, I love Old Chappers, don't<br>	you, Cap?<br><br>Edmund: Unfortuately no I don't. I find his films about as funny as getting an<br>	arrow through the neck and discovering there's a gas bill tied to it.<br><br>George: Ah, beg pardon, sir, but come off! His films are ball-bouncingly funny.<br>	<br>Edmund: Rubbish!<br><br>George: Alright, why let's consult the men for a casting vote, shall we? Bal-<br>	drick?<br><br>Baldrick: (entering) Sir!<br><br>George: Charlie Chaplin, Baldrick. What do you make of him?<br><br>Baldrick: Oh sir, he's as funny as a vegetable that's grown into a rude and <br>	  amusing shape, sir.<br><br>Edmund: So you agree with me. Not at all funny?<br><br>George: Oh come on, skipper, it ain't fair. I haven't asked for all of this.<br>	When he kicked that fellow in the backside, I thought I'd die!<br><br>Edmund: Well, if that's your idea of comedy, we can provide our own without<br>	(??) for the priviledge. (kicks Baldrick) There, you find that funny?<br><br>George: Well, no of course not, sir, but you see, Chaplin is a genius.<br><br>Edmund: He certainly is a genuis, George. He invented a way of getting a <br>	million dollars a year by wearing stupid trousers. Did you find that<br>	funny, Baldrick?<br><br>Baldrick: What funny, sir?<br><br>Edmund: (kicks Baldrick again) That funny.<br><br>Baldrick: No sir, you mustn't do that to me sir, because that is a bourgois<br>	  act of repression, sir.<br><br>Edmund: What? <br><br>Baldrick: I think I smelt it sir, there's something afoot in the wind. The<br>	  huddled masses yearning to be free.<br><br>Edmund: Baldrick, have you been through the diesel oil again? <br><br>Baldrick: No sir, I've been sopping the milk of freedom. Already our Russian<br>	  comrades are poised on the brink of Revolution. And here too, sir, <br>	  the huddled what's-names such as myself, sir, are ready to throw<br>	  off the hated oppressors like you and the Lieutenant. Present com<br>	  pany accepted, sir. <br><br>Edmund: Go and clean out the latrines.<br><br>Baldrick: Yes sir, right away, sir.<br><br>George: Now the reason why Chaplin is so funny, because he's part of a great<br>	British music hall tradition.<br><br>Edmund: Oh yes, the Great British Music Hall Tradition. Two men, with incred-<br>	ibly unconvincing Cockney accents going, "what's up with you then?<br>	What's up with me then? Yeah, what's up with you then? (????????)"<br>	GET ON WITH IT!!!<br><br>George: Now sir, that was funny! You should have gotten a part yourself!<br><br>Edmund: Thank you, George, but if you don't mind, I'd rather have my tongue<br>	beaten wafer-thin by a steak tenderiser and then stapled to the floor<br>	with a croquet hoop.<br><br>(loud voices are heard outside)<br><br>Baldrick: (rushing in) Sir, sir, it's all over the trenches!<br><br>Edmund: Well, mop it up then.<br><br>Baldrick: No sir, the news. The Russian Revolution has started. The masses<br>	  have risen up and shoveled their nobs!<br><br>George: Well, hurrah!<br><br>Edmund: (reading a newspaper) Oh no, the Russians have pulled out of the war.<br><br>George: Well, we soon sawed them off, didn't we sir? Miserable slant-eye,<br>	sausage eating swine.<br><br>Edmund: The Russians are on *our* side, George.<br><br>George: Oh really?<br><br>Edmund: And they've abandoned the Eastern Front.<br><br>Baldrick: And they've overthrown Nicholas II who used to be bizzare.<br><br>Edmund: Who used to be *the czar*, Baldrick. The point is, now that the <br>	Russians have made peace with the Kaiser. At this very moment,<br>	three quarters of a million Germans are leaving the Russian Front<br>	and coming over *here* with the express purpose of using my nipples<br>	for target practise. There's only one thing for it, I'll have to<br>	desert and I'm going to have to do it....right now.<br><br>(enter General Melchett)<br><br>Melchett: Are you leaving us, Blackadder?<br><br>Edmund: No sir.<br><br>Melchett: Well I'm relieved to hear it. I need you to help me shoot more <br>	  deserters later on. There have been some subversive mutterings <br>	  amongst the men. You'll recall the French army last year at <br>	  Verdun where the top eschelons suffered from horrendeous uprisings<br>	  from the bottom.<br><br>Edmund: Yes sir, but surely that was traced to a shipment of garlic eclairs.<br><br>Melchett: Nonsense Blackadder! It was bolshevist. Plain bolshevist! And now<br>	  that the Ruskys have followed suit, I'm damned if I can let the<br>	  same thing happen here.<br><br>Edmund: Oh, and what are you going to do about it, sir?<br><br>Melchett: I'm going to have a concert party to boost the men's morale.<br><br>George: A concert party, well, hurrah!<br><br>Melchett: You fancy an evening at a concert party, Blackadder?<br><br>Edmund: Well frankly sir, I'd rather spend an evening on top of a stepladder<br>	in No Man's Land smoking cigarettes through an illuminous balacava (?).<br><br>Melchett: Well, I didn't think it would be your cup of tea, but I do need <br>	  someone to help me organise it, you know. Obviously not a tough <br>	  grizzled old soldier like yourself, but some kind of dandified<br>	  nancy-boy who will be prepared to spend the rest of the war in <br>	  the London Palladium.<br><br>Edmund: The show's going to the London Palladium, sir?<br><br>Melchett: Oh yes of course. No good crushing the Revolution over here only<br>	  to get back home to Blighty and find that everyone's wearing over-<br>	  alls and breaking wind in the palaces of the mighty.<br><br>Edmund: Good point, sir.<br><br>Melchett: So the thing is, Blackadder, finding a man to organise a concert <br>	  party is going t6o be damn difficult. So, I've come up with rather<br>	  a cunning set of questions with which to test the candidate's <br>	  suitability for the job.<br><br>Edmund: And what sort of questions would these be, sir?<br><br>Melchett: Well, the first question is, 'do you like Charlie Chaplin?'<br><br>Edmund: (looks at George) Dismissed, Lieutenant. (George salutes and leaves)<br>	'Do you like Charlie Chaplin?', yes that is a good question for a<br>	candidate, ah, to which my answer would of course be, 'yes, I love<br>	him, love him, sir, particularly the amusing kicks.<br><br>George: That's what I said because I thought you said....<br><br>Edmund: (abruptly) Goodbye George.<br><br>Melchett: And the second question is, 'do you like music hall?'<br><br>Edmund: Ah, yes, another good question, sir. Again, my answer would have to <br>	be 'yes, absolutely love it.' (mimiking) "Oops, Mr. Rothschild, (??)"<br>	<br>Melchett: Umm, yes. Well, it's in my view, Blackadder, that a person who	<br>	  would answer 'yes' to both questions would be ideal for the jo-<br>	  (realises Edmund's early affirmative responses). Wait a minute.<br><br>Edmund: What sir?<br><br>Melchett: (laughs) Why, without knowing it, Blackadder, you've inadvertently<br>	  shown me that you can do the job.<br><br>Edmund: Have I sir?<br><br>Melchett: Yes sir! You have, sir. And I want you to start work straight away.<br>	  A couple of shows over the weekend and if all goes well, we'll start<br>	  you off in London next Monday.<br><br>Edmund: Oh...damn. <br><br>Melchett: If you need any help fixing and carrying and backstage and so on, <br>	  I'll lend you my driver if you like. (calls out) Bob?!<br><br>(a woman enters....the driver Bob)<br><br>Bob: (militaristically) Driver Parker reporting for duty, sir!<br><br>Melchett: Alright, at ease, Bob, stand easy. Captain Blackadder, this is Bob.<br><br>Edmund: Bob?<br><br>Bob: Good morning, sir.<br><br>Edmund: Unusual name for a girl?<br><br>Melchett: Oh yes, it would be an unusual name for a girl, but it's a perfectly<br>	  straightforward name for a young chap like you, eh Bob? Now Bob, I<br>	  want you to bunk up with Captain Blackadder for a couple of days, al-<br>	  right?<br><br>Bob: Yes sir.<br><br>Melchett: I think you'll find Bob just the man for this job, Blackadder. He has<br>	  a splendid sense of humour.<br><br>Edmund: He sir? He? He?<br><br>Melchett: You see, you're laughing already! Well then, Bob, I'll leave you two<br>	  together, why don't you get to know each other, play a game of crim-<br>	  mage, have a smoke, something like that. They tell me that Captain	<br>	  Blackadder has rather a good line in rough shag. Um, I'm sure he'd<br>	  be happy to fill your pipe. Carry on. (exits)<br><br>Edmund: So you're a 'chap', are you Bob?<br><br>Bob: Oh yes, sir. (laughs)<br><br>Edmund: You wouldn't say you were a girl at all?<br><br>Bob: Oh, definitely not, sir. I understand cricket, I fart in bed, everything.<br><br>Edmund: Let me put it another way, Bob, you are a girl. And you're a girl with<br>	as much talent for disguise as a giraffe in dark glasses trying to get<br>	into a 'Polar Bears Only' golf club.<br><br>Bob: Oh sir, please don't give me away, sir. I just wanted to be like my bro-<br>	thers and join up. I want to see how a real war is fought....so badly.<br><br>Edmund: Well, you've come to the right place, Bob. A war hasn't been fought <br>	*this* badly since Olaf the Hairy, Chief of all the Vikings, accidently<br>	ordered 80,000 battle helmets with the horns on the *inside*.<br><br>Bob: I want to do my bit for the boys, sir. <br><br>Edmund: Oh really?<br><br>Bob: I'll do anything, sir!<br><br>Edmund: Yes, now keep that to yourself, if I was you.<br><br><br>(Edmund and Bob go over repetoire for concert hall show)<br><br>Edmund: Alright Bob, the second half start with Corporal Smith and Johnson as<br>	the Three Silly Twerps.<br><br>Bob: Alright, sir.<br><br>Edmund: The big joke being that there's only two of them.<br><br>Baldrick: (laughing) I know that, it always cracks me up, sir.<br><br>Edmund: Followed by Baldrick's impersonation of Charlie Chaplin. Bob, take a <br>	telegram.<br><br>Bob: Yes sir.<br><br>Edmund: Mr. C. Chaplin, Sennett Studios, Hollywood, California. (???) stop.<br>	Have discovered only person in the world less funny than you stop.<br>	Name Baldrick stop. yours, E. Blackadder stop.' Oh, and put a PS.<br>	'Please please please stop.' Now after that, we have, ladies and <br>	gentlemen, the highlight of our show. <br><br>Baldrick: Ta-da...<br><br>(enter George in drag)<br><br>George: I feel fantastic!<br><br>Edmund: Gorgeous Georgina, the traditional soldier's drag act.<br><br>Baldrick: You look absolutely lovely, sir.<br><br>Edmund: Well Baldrick, you are lined (?), blind, or mad. The Lieutenant looks<br>	as all soldiers look on these occasions, about as feminine as W. G. <br>	Grace. What are you going to give them, George?<br><br>George: Well, I thought one or two cheeky gags, one followed by 'She was only<br>	the ironmonger's daughter but she knew a surprising amount about fish<br>	as well'.<br><br>Edmund: (sarcatic) Inspired. Well, at least you made an effort with the dress,<br>	what is your costume, Baldrick?<br><br>Baldrick: I'm in it, sir.<br><br>Edmund: I see. So your Charlie Chaplin costume consists of only that hat.<br><br>Baldrick: Except that in this box, I've a dead slug as a brillaint false<br>	  moustache.<br><br>Edmund: Yes, it's only quite brilliant, I fear. How, for instance, are you<br>	to attach it to your face?<br><br>Baldrick: Well, I was hoping to persuade the slug to cling on, sir.<br><br>Edmund: Baldrick, the slug is dead. If it failed to cling on to life, I see<br>	no reason that it should cling on to your upper lip.<br><br>George: Baldrick, Baldrick come on. Slugs are always a problem. What you do<br>	is screw your face up like this you see and you can clamp it between<br>	your top lip and your nose.<br><br>Baldrick: (leaning backward) What? Like this, sir?<br><br>George: See, that's it, that's good. Sir, sir, there's a visitor to see you.<br><br>Edmund: (faking, but convincing) Good Lord, Mr. Chaplin! This is indeed an<br>	honour. Why, this calls for some sort of celebration. Baldrick, Bal-<br>	drick!<br><br>George: Sir, that is extraordinary, because, because this isn't Chaplin at all.<br>	This *is* Baldrick.<br><br>Baldrick: It is, it's *me*, sir!<br><br>Edmund: I know, I know. I was, in fact being sarcastic.<br><br>George: Oh, I see. Umm.<br><br>Edmund: Everything goes above your head, doesn't it, George? You should go to<br>	Jamaica and become a limbo dancer.<br><br><br>(at the concert....backstage, George is seen giving encores)<br><br>Bob: They love him, sir. We're a hit!<br><br>Edmund: Yes, in one short evening, I've become the most successful impresario<br>	since the manager of the Roman Coliseum thought of putting the Christ-<br>	ians and the lions on the same bill.<br><br><br>Baldrick: Sir, some people seem to think I was best! Do you agree?<br><br>Edmund: Baldrick, in the Amazonian rain forests, there are tribes of Indians<br>	yet untouched by civilisation who could develop more convincing Char-<br>	lie Chaplin impressionists.<br><br>Baldrick: Thank you very much, sir.<br><br>Bob: (refering to George aka Georgina): He's coming out.<br><br>George: What do you think, Bob, one more? God, I love attention! (goes off<br>	stage to join Edmund and company) It's in my blood and soul. Bal-<br>	drick, put this in some water, will you?<br><br>(Baldrick dunks the flowers into the vase upside-down)<br><br>George: I need that applause in the same way that a osler needs his osle.<br><br>Bob: Well done, sir!<br><br>George: (being modest) No, sir, I really, I was hopeless. I mean, tell me<br>	honestly, sir, I was, wasn't I?<br><br>Edmund: Well...<br><br>George: No, no, no, come on, sir. Out with it, cos I really need to know,<br>	I was hopeless.<br><br>Edmund: No....<br><br>George: You're trying to be nice and that's very sweet of you, but sir, please,<br>	I can take it. I was hoepless.<br><br>Edmund: George, you were bloody *awful*!<br><br>(George sobs.)<br><br>Edmund: But you can't argue with the box office. Personally, I thought you were<br>	the least convincing female impressionist since Tarzan went through<br>	Jane's handbag and ate her lipstick. But I'm clearly in the minority.<br>	Look out London, here we come!<br><br><br>(at Melchett's headquarters, 'HQ'. Capt. Darling sits at his desk)<br><br>Edmund: Ah, Captain Darling.<br><br>Darling: Ah, Captain Blackadder.<br><br>Edmund: I must say, I had an absolutely splendid evening. Oh, glad you <br>	enjoyed the show.<br><br>Darling: The show? I couldn't go to the show. Important regimental business.<br><br>Edmund: A lorry load of paper clips arrived?<br><br>Darling: Two lorry loads, actually.<br><br>Melchett: (enters) Ah, welcome to the great director, Miestrum.<br><br>Edmund: You enjoyed it, sir?<br><br>Melchett: Well, it was mostly awful, but I enjoyed the slug balance.<br><br>Edmund: Private Baldrick, sir.<br><br>Melchett: That's right, yes. The slug fell off a couple of times, but it<br>	  was....you can't have everything, can't you? I just suggest a<br>	  bit more practise and prehaps a sparkly costume for the slug.<br><br>Edmund: I'll pass that on, sir.<br><br>Melchett: But I do have certain others reasons for believing the show to be<br>	  nothing but a triumph. Captain Darling has your travel arrangements,	<br>	  ticket to Dover, rooms at the Ritz and so forth.<br><br>Edmund: Oh, thank you sir.<br><br>Melchett: However, there is one small thing you can do for me.<br><br>Edmund: Yes?<br><br>Melchett: Captain Blackadder, I should esteem it a single honour if you would	<br>	  allow me to escort your leading lady to the regimental ball this<br>	  evening.<br><br>Edmund: My leading lady?<br><br>Melchett: The fair Georgina.<br><br>Edmund: Ah, ha-ha, very amusing.<br><br>Melchett: You think she'll laugh in my face? I'm too old, too crusty?<br><br>Edmund: Uh, no, no. It's just as her director, I'm afraid I could not allow<br>	it.<br><br>Melchett: I can always find another director who *would* allow it!<br><br>Edmund: Quite. I'll see what I can do, but I must insist that she be home by<br>	midnight and that there'll be no hanky-panky, sir, whatsoever.<br><br>Melchett: I shall, of course, respect your wishes, Blackadder. However I don't<br>	  think you need to be quite so protective. I'm sure she's a girl with<br>	  a great deal of spunk than most women you can find.<br><br>Edmund: Oh, dear me.<br><br><br>(at the barracks)<br><br>George: Absolutely not, sir. It's profoundly immoral, and utterly wrong. I<br>	will not do it.<br><br>Edmund: We can always find another leading lady.<br><br>George: Well, the dress will need a clean.<br><br>Edmund: Excellent. Now the important thing is, that Melchett should, under no <br>	circumstances, realise that you are a man.<br><br>George: Yes, yes, I understand that.<br><br>Edmund: In order to insure this, there are three basic rules. One, you must <br>	never, I repeat, never remove your wig.<br><br>George: Right.<br><br>Edmund: Second, never say anything. Tell him at the beginning of the evening<br>	that you're saving your voice for the opening night in London.<br><br>George: Excellent, sir. And what's the third?<br><br>Edmund: The third is most important, don't get drunk and let him shag you on<br>	the veranda.<br><br><br>(in Melchett's private quarters. The general puts on an impressive bemedaled <br>red jacket. Darling is with him.)<br><br>Melchett: (after a few sounds of self-satisfaction) How do I look, Darling?<br><br>Darling: Girl-bait, sir. Pure bloody girl-bait.<br><br>Melchett: Moustache? Bushy enough?<br><br>Darling: Like a private hedge, sir.<br><br>Melchett: Good, because I want to catch a particularly beautiful creature in <br>	  this bush tonight.<br><br>Darling: You'll have her coming out of your moustache for a week, sir.<br><br>Melchett: God, it's a spankingly beautiful world and tonight's my night. I <br>	  know what I'll say to her. 'Darling...'<br><br>Darling: (mistaken that the general's addressing him) Yes sir?<br><br>Melchett: What?<br><br>Darling: Um, I don't know, sir.<br><br>Melchett: Well don't butt in! (exhales) 'I want to make you happy, darling'.<br><br>Darling: Well, that's very kind of you sir.<br><br>Melchett: Will you kindly stop interrupting? If you don't listen, how can you<br>	  tell me what you think? (continues) 'I want to make you happy, dar-<br>	  ling. I want to build a nest for your ten tiny toes. I want to cover<br>	  every inch of your gorgeous body in pether and sneeze all over you.'<br><br>Darling: I really think I must protest!<br><br>Melchett: What is the matter with you, Darling?<br><br>Darling: Well, it's all so sudden, I mean the nest bit's fine, but the pether<br>	 business is definitely out!<br><br>Melchett: How dare you tell me how I may or may not treat my beloved Georgina?<br><br>Darling: Georgina?<br><br>Melchett: Yes, I'm working on what to say to her this evening.<br><br>Darling: Oh yes. Of course. Thank God.<br><br>Melchett: Alright?<br><br>Darling: Yes, I'm listening, sir.<br><br>Melchett: Honestly Darling, you really are the most graceless, dim-witted<br>	  pumpkin I ever met.<br><br>Darling: I don't think you should say that to her.<br><br>(Melchett groans)<br><br><br>(at the barracks)<br><br>Edmund: Where's that George? It's three o'clock in the morning, he should be<br>	careful wandering the trench at night with nothing to protect his <br>	honour but a cricket box.<br><br>George (entering): Hello Captain.<br><br>Edmund: About time, where the hell have you been?<br><br>George: Well I don't know, it's all been like a dream, my very first ball.<br>	The music, the dancing, the champagne, my mind is a mad world. Half	<br>	whispered conversation with the promise of indisretion ever hanging<br>	in the air.<br><br>Edmund: No, that old stoke Melchett tried for a snog behind the fruit cup.<br><br>George: Certainly not! The general behaved like a perfect gentleman. We tired<br>	the moon with our talking about everything and nothing. The war, mar-<br>	riage, proposed changes of the LBW rule.<br><br>Edmund: Melchett isn't married, is he?<br><br>George: No, no, all his life, he's been waiting to meet the perfect woman. And<br>	tonight, he did.<br><br>Edmund: Some poor unfortunate had Old Walrus-face dribbling in her ear all <br>	evening, did she? <br><br>George: Well yes. As a matter of fact, I did have to drape a napkin over my<br>	shoulder, yes.<br><br>Edmund: George, are you trying to tell me that you're the General's perfect <br>	woman?<br><br>George: Well, yes, I rather think I am.<br><br>Edmund: Well thank God the horny old blighthead didn't ask you to marry him.<br><br>(George stares out to Edmund, affirming this fact in silence)<br><br>Edmund: He did?! Well how did you get out of that one?<br><br>George: Well, to be honest, sir, I'm not absolutely certain that I did.<br><br>Edmund: WHAT?!<br><br>George: You don't understand what it was like, sir. You know, the candles, <br>	the music, the huge moustache, I can't remember it. (?)<br><br>Edmund: You said 'yes'?<br><br>George: Oh, well he is a general, I didn't really feel I could refuse. He <br>	might have me court-martialed.<br><br>Edmund: Whereas on the other hand, of course, he's going to give you the<br>	Victoria Cross when he lifts up your frock on the wedding night<br>	and finds himself looking at the blast turkey at the shop.<br><br>George: Yes, I, I, I know it's mess, ah but, you see, he got me scriffy and<br>	then when he looked into my eyes and said 'Chipmunk, I love you.'<br><br>Edmund: CHIPMUNK???<br><br>George: It's a special name for me, you see, he says my nose looks just like<br>	a chipmunk's.<br><br>Edmund: Oh God! We're in serious serious trouble here. If the General ever <br>	finds out that Gorgeous Georgina is, in fact, a strapping six footer<br>	from the rough end of the trench, which will precipitate the fastest<br>	execution since someone said, 'this Guy Fawlkes bloke, do we let him<br>	off, or wot?'<br><br>(phone rings, Edmund answers it)<br><br>Edmund: Hello? Yes sir. Straight away sir. (hangs up) That was your finacee,<br>	'Chipmunk'. He wants to see me. If I should die, think only this of <br>	me, 'I'll be back to get ya!'.<br><br><br>(at HQ again)<br><br>Edmund: Sir, I can explain everything.<br><br>Melchett: Can you, Blackadder? Can you?<br><br>Edmund: Well.....no sir, not really.<br><br>Melchett: I thought not, I thought not. Who can explain the mysteries of love?<br>	  I'm in love with Georgina, Blackadder. I'm going to marry her on Sa-<br>	  turday and I want you to be my best man.<br><br><br>Edmund: I don't think that would be a very good idea, sir.<br><br>Melchett: And why not?<br><br>Edmund: Because there's something wrong with your finacee, sir.<br><br>Melchett: Oh my God, she's not Welsh, is she?<br><br>Edmund: No sir. Um, it's a terrible story, but true. Just a few minutes ago<br>	Georgina arrived unexpectedly in my trench. She was literally dancing<br>	with joy as if something wonderful had happened to her.<br><br>Melchett: Makes sense.<br><br>Edmund: Unfortunately, she was in such a daze, danced straight throught the 	<br>	trench and out into No Man's Land. I tried to stop her, but before<br>	I could say, 'Don't tread on a mine', she trod on a mine.<br><br>(Melchett starts to sob)<br><br>Edmund: When I say 'a mine', it was a cluster of mines, and she was blown to<br>	smitereens, rocketed up into the air, said something I couldn't quite<br>	catch, totally incomprehensible to me, something like, 'Tell him, his<br>	little chipmunk will love him forever'.<br><br>(Melchett howls in sadness)<br><br>Darling: It's heartnreaking, sir.<br><br>Edmund: I'm sorry sir.<br><br>Melchett: (recovering) Oh well, can't be helped, can't be helped.<br><br>Darling: Jolly bad luck, sir. Of course, on top of everything else, without<br>	  your leading lady, you won't be able to put on your show. So no <br>	  show, no London Palladium.<br><br>Edmund: On the contrary, I'm simply intending to rename it, the Georgina <br>	Melchett Memorial Show.<br><br>Melchett: Oh no, Georgina was the only thing that made the show come alive.<br>	  Apart from her, it was all awful!<br><br>Darling: Awful!<br><br>Melchett: You'll never find a girl like Georgina by tommorrow.<br><br>Edmund: Well, it's funny you should say that sir, because I think I already<br>	have.<br><br>Melchett: Who is she?<br><br>Darling: Who is she?<br><br><br>(back at the barracks)<br><br>George: (as his 'normal' male self) So, come on, sir, who is she?<br><br>Edmund: Well, that's the problem. I haven't a bloody clue! The only exacting<br>	woman around here is carved out of stone called 'Venus' and is stan-<br>	ding in a fountain in the town square with water coming out of her <br>	armpits.<br><br>George: So we're a bit stuck.<br><br>Bob: (passing through) Morning chaps.<br><br>Edmund and George: Morning Bob.<br><br>Edmund: You can say that again, George. We're in a stickier situation since <br>	Sticky the Stick Insect got stuck on a sticky bun. We are in trouble.<br><br>(enter Baldrick in drag)<br><br>Baldrick: No anymore sir. May I present my cunning plan. <br><br>Edmund: Don't be ridiculous, Baldrick. Can you sing, can you dance? Or are<br>	you offering to be sawn in half?<br><br>Baldrick: I don't think those things are important in a modern marriage, sir.<br>	  I offer simple home cooking.<br><br>Edmund: Our plan is to find a new leading lady for our show. What is your plan?<br><br>Baldrick: My plan is that I will marry General Melchett. I am the other woman.<br><br>George: Well, congradulations Baldrick. I hope you will be very happy.<br><br>Baldrick: I will, sir, cos when I get back from honeymoon, I will be a member<br>	  of the aristocracy and you will have to call me 'M'lady'.<br><br>Edmund: What happened to your Revolutionary principles, Baldrick? I thought <br>	you hated the aristocracy.<br><br>Baldrick: I'm working to bring down the system from within, sir. I'm a sort<br>	  of a Frozen Horse.<br><br>Edmund: *Trojan House*, Baldrick.<br><br>Baldrick: Anmyway, I can't see what's so stupid about marry into wealth for 	<br>	  money and not having to sleep in a puddle.<br><br>Edmund: Baldrick, NO! It's the worst plan since Abraham Lincoln said, 'Oh I'm<br>	sick of kicking around the house tonight. Let's take in a show.' And<br>	for a start, General Melchett is in mourning for the woman of his <br>	dreams. He's unlikely to be in the mood to marry a two legged badger<br>	wrapped in a curtain.. Anyway we are looking for a great entertainer<br>	and you're the worst entertainer since St. Paul the Evangelist toured<br>	Palestine with his trampoline act. Nah, we have to find somebody else.<br><br>George: What about Corporal Cartwright, sir?<br><br>Edmund: Corporal Cartwright looks like an orangatang. I've heard of the Bearded<br>	Lady, but the All Over Body Hair Lady simply just isn't on.<br><br>George: Willis?<br><br>Edmund: Too short.<br><br>George: Petheridge?<br><br>Edmund: Too old.<br><br>George: Taplowe?<br><br>Edmund: Too dead. Ah, this is hopeless. There just isn't anyone!<br><br>(Bob is heard singing)<br><br>Bob: 'Goodbyeee, goodbyeee, wipe the tear, baby dear, from your eyeee'.<br><br>Edmund: What am I doing? (calls out) Bob!<br><br>Bob: (naked but for a towel): Sir?<br><br>George: What a brilliant idea! Bob, can you think of anyone who can be our<br>	leading lady?<br><br><br>(at another concert performance)<br><br>George: What do you think, Bob, one more?<br><br>Bob: No George, always leave them hungry.<br><br>Edmund: Congradulations, Bob. I must admit, I thought you were bloody mar-<br>	vellous.<br><br>Bob: Thank you sir. Permission to slip into something more uncomfortable, sir.<br><br>Edmund: Permission granted.<br><br>Baldrick: Oh sir, it's going to be wonderful. Not just for me, but for my little<br>	  partner, Graham. Doing our tour halfway 'round the world.<br><br>Edmund: Yes, from Shaftsbury Avenue to the Co^te du Jour, they'll be saying,<br>	'I like the little black one, but who's that burkey sitting on it?'<br><br>Baldrick: I'm not with you, sir.<br><br>Edmund: No, of course not. But don't worry, we'll have years in luxury hotels<br>	for me to explain. Now get packing, get packing. The Burtrain (?) <br>	leaves at six and we're going to be on it.<br><br>Darling: (entering) Blackadder.<br><br>Edmund: Ah Darling, everything alright?<br><br>Darling: Oh yes.<br><br>Edmund: Got the tickets?<br><br>Darling: Oh yes.<br><br>Melchett: (calling, enters) Blackadder!?<br><br>Edmund: Oh hi, General. Enjoy the show?<br><br>Melchett: Don't be ridiculous, the worst evening I've ever spent in my life!<br>	  (paces forward toward Edmund)<br><br>Edmund: (pacing backward) I'm sorry?<br><br>Melchett: (yells) Will you stand still when I'm talking to you! If by a man's <br>	  works showing (??) that you were a steaming pile of horse manure.<br><br>Edmund: But surely, sir, the show was a trimuph.<br><br>Melchett: (yells real loud) TRIMUPH? The Three Twerps were one Twerp short,	<br>	  again; the Slug Balancer seems now to be doing some feeble impres-<br>	  sion of Buster Keaton; and worst of all, the crowning turd in the<br>	  waterpipe, that revolting drag act in the end.<br><br>Edmund: Drag?<br><br>Melchett: Yes, poor Bob Parker's been made to look a total ass! With that reedy<br>	  voice and that stupid effeminate dancing.<br><br>Darling: So the show's cancelled, permenantly. (rips up plane tickets)<br><br>Edmund: But what about the men's morale, sir, with the Russians out of the war<br>	and everything?<br><br>Melchett: Oh for goodness sake, Blackadder, have you been living in a cave?<br>	  The Amercians joined the war yesterday.<br><br>Edmund: So how is that going to improve the men's morale, sir?<br><br>Melchett: OOooooohhh, because you jibbering imbecile, they've brought with 	<br>	  them the largest collection of Charlie Chaplin films in existence.<br>	  I've lost patience with you. Fill him in, Darling. (exits)<br><br>Darling: We received a telegram this morning from Mr. Chaplin himself, at <br>	 Sennett Studios: (reads) 'Twice nightly screening of my films in<br>	 trenches, excellent idea stop. But must insist E. Blackadder be<br>	 projectionist. Oh PS, don't let him ever stop.'<br><br>Edmund: Oh great.<br><br>Darling: No hard feelings, Blackadder.<br><br>Edmund: Not at all Darling. Uh, care for a licoriche assortment(?)?<br><br>Darling: (accepts it....which turns out to be Baldrick's dead slug) Well,<br>	 thank you. (eats it)<br><br><br>			*****FINIS****<br><br><br><br>
