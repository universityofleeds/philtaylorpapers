<br>
<br>
<br>(George, Edmund and Baldrick are in their room in the trenches)
<br> 
<br>George: I spy with my little eye (he looks behind his shoulder and sees a
<br>	mug) something beginning with `M'.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: Erm...
<br> 
<br>George: (encouraging) MMM...
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: Erm...
<br> 
<br>George: (encouraging) MMM... (he bobs his head down to within inches of the
<br>	mug a few times)
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: Mmm...
<br> 
<br>	(this carries on for a while)
<br> 
<br>George: MMMuh... (he picks up the mug and holds it in front of him)
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: Mmm...
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (wishing he could read his book in peace; can't stand this carrying
<br>	on any longer; shouts) MUG!!!
<br> 
<br>George: Oh, I say, well done, sir. Your turn.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: I spy with my bored little eye something beginning with `T'.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: Breakfast!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: What?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: My breakfast always begins with tea, and I have a little sausage,
<br>          and a egg with some little soldiers.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Baldrick, when I said it begins with `T', I was talking about a letter.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: Nah, it never begins with a letter; the postman don't come 'til
<br>	  10.30.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: I can't go on with this. (stands) George, take over.
<br> 
<br>George: All right, sir. Erm, I spy with my litle eye something beginning
<br>	with `R'.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: (raises his arm, even though he's the only one playing now) Army!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: For God's sake, Baldrick! `Army' starts with an `A'. He's looking for
<br>	something that starts with an `R'. RRRrrrrr!
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: Motorbike!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: What?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: A motorbike starts with a `RRRRRrrrrrrrrrm! RRRRRRrrrrrrrrrr--'
<br> 
<br>Edmund: All right, right, right, right. My turn again. What begins with `Come
<br>	here' and ends with `Ow'?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: I don't know.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Come here.
<br> 
<br>	(Baldrick moves closer to Edmund; Edmund punches Baldrick in the face)
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: Ow! (falls to the ground)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Well done.
<br> 
<br>George: No (laughs), I don't think you've quite got the hang of this 
<br>        game, to be honest, sir. I tell you what, let's try another one.
<br>        Erm, I hear with my little ear, er, something beginning with 
<br>        `B'.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: What?
<br> 
<br>George: Bomb.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: I can't hear a bomb.
<br> 
<br>George: Listen very carefully.
<br> 
<br>	(a bomb approaching whistle is heard)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Ah yes.
<br> 
<br>	(The bomb explodes)
<br> 
<br> 
<br>(in hospital; George is wounded from that bomb and is talking to Nurse
<br>Mary about a letter he's writing; Mary is massaging his foot)
<br> 
<br>George: Finished.
<br> 
<br>Mary: Come on, then.
<br> 
<br>George: All right, and then you can tell me what you think, but be honest,
<br>	now.
<br> 
<br>Mary: (giggly) I will!
<br> 
<br>George: All right, then. (reads) "Dear Uncle H., how are you?" (Nurse laughs)
<br>        Yeah, it's good isn't it? Erm, "It's beastly rotten luck being laid
<br>	up here, but everyone's very nice, and at least now I can write to
<br>	you every day." Oh, ahem, then I put in that silly bit about, er...
<br> 
<br>Mary: What? What?
<br> 
<br>George: No, it's, er...
<br> 
<br>Mary: Oh, come on, you can tell me.
<br> 
<br>George: "And the nurse is an absolute peach." (buries his face in the letter,
<br>	embarrassed) Anyway, "After the explosion, Captain Blackadder was
<br>	marvellous. He joked and joked. `You lucky lucky lucky bastard!' he
<br>	cried. Then he lay on his back, stuck his foot over the top of the 
<br>        trench, and shouted, `Over here, Fritz! What about me? What about
<br>	me?' "
<br> 
<br>Mary: Well, Captain Blacky does indeed sound a most witty and courageous chap.
<br> 
<br>George: Yes, and he's very amusing and brave, as well. Not to mention he's as
<br>        clever as a chap with three heads!
<br> 
<br>	(Mary stands, ruffles George's hair and fluffs his pillows)
<br> 
<br>George: Thanks ever so much. You really are terribly kind, as well as being
<br>	dash pretty to boot.
<br> 
<br>Mary: (having retrieved a teddy bear from behind the pillows) Oh dear.
<br>      A fluffy pillow and a big cheery smile is the least my lovely boyses
<br>      deserve. (gives George the teddy bear) Now, you take a little trip to
<br>      Dozy Land. (george takes the bear and begins sucking his thumb) You've
<br>      got visitors coming, and we don't want to be all tired and cross (??),
<br>      do we?
<br> 
<br>George: Absolutely not, no. It'll be so jolly to see Baldrick and the cap
<br>	again. They'll have been worried sick about me, you know.
<br> 
<br>	(Edmund and Baldrick enter)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: All right, where is the malingering git?
<br> 
<br>George: Hello, Cap! Pip pip, Balders! Here I lie.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: Nice to see the lieutenant looking so well, sir.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Of course he's looking well -- there's nothing wrong with him.
<br> 
<br>George: Pff! (to Mary) Didn't I tell you the captain was a super (cope? [as
<br>	a made-up noun form of `copesetic'?])!
<br> 
<br>Mary: (bubbly) You did! (stands) Well, Captain, you are indeed fortunate to
<br>      have a loyal friend like darling Georgy.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Mm, I think you might be under a slight misapprehension here, Nurse.
<br>	I lost closer friends than `Darling Georgy' the last time I was
<br>	deloused. Now, if you will excuse me, I've got better things to do
<br>	than exchange pleasantries with a wet blanket. Would you get out?
<br> 
<br>	(Mary is agape)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: We've got some important military business...
<br> 
<br>Nurse: Well, ten minutes only, then. (leaves)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Right, porkface, where's the grub? (sits in bedside chair)
<br> 
<br>George: Pardon?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Come on, the moment that collection of inbred mutants you call your
<br>	relatives heard you were sick, they'll have sent you a hamper the
<br>	size of Westminster Abbey.
<br> 
<br>George: My family is not inbred!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Come on, somewhere outside (Saffon-Waldon?) there's an uncle who's
<br>        seven feet tall with no chin and an Adam's apple that makes him
<br>        look as though he's constantly trying to swallow a ballcock.
<br> 
<br>George: I have not got any uncles like that! Anyway, he lives in
<br>	(Walton-on-the-Naise?).
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Well, exactly. Now, where's the tuck?
<br> 
<br>George: Well, there were one or two things, yes. There was, er, a potted
<br>	turkey, a (??) jelly, three tinned sheep, and, er, twelve hundred
<br>	chocolates. But, in my weakened state...
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Yes?
<br> 
<br>George: ...I, er, I ate them.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: What?
<br> 
<br>George: Well, Nurse Mary nibbled a trotter or two, but... Oh, Cap, she's such
<br>	a wonderful girl. She helps me with all my letters, she can do all the
<br>	German spelling and she's terribly good at punctuation.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: I don't care if she can sing `I May Be a Tiny Chimney Sweep, But I've
<br>	Got an Enormous Brush'. Come on, Baldrick -- the only thing we're
<br>	going to get for free around here is dysentery.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: (softly) But, sir, I haven't given Lieutenant George my bunch of
<br>	  flowers yet.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Alright, hurry up, hurry up.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: Here you are, sir, I got you these. (holds up some flower stems, sans
<br>	  the actual flowers) Unfortunately, they've had their heads shot off.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Whereas (??) say it with flowers, Baldrick says it with stalks.
<br> 
<br>	(Mary enters during that line)
<br> 
<br>Mary: Well, Captain, I'm afraid you'll have to leave us now.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Oh really?
<br> 
<br>Mary: Yes. You must report to General Melchett immediately.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Oh great. Yet another tempting opportunity for suicide beckons.
<br> 
<br>George: Gosh, I wish I could come with you, you know, sir.
<br> 
<br>Mary: Oh no, you must take care, my brave hero. (puts hand on his forehead)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: `Brave hero', Nurse? I was more wounded the last time I clipped my
<br>	toenails.
<br> 
<br>Mary: (to George) Take no notice of him.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (in a sarcastically sympathetic voice) Yes, pay no attention to the
<br>        nasty man.
<br> 
<br>Mary: Look, If I can't give my brave boys a kind word and a big smile, what
<br>      can I give them?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Well, one or two ideas do suggest themselves, but you'd probably
<br>	think they were unhygenic.
<br> 
<br>	(Mary leaves in huff, while another patient, Smith, limps in)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Come on, Baldrick. (turns to Smith) Hello, what's your name?
<br> 
<br>Smith: (with German accent) My name is Mr Smith.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: I'm sorry that you've been landed opposite to such a total git, Smith.
<br>        It's bad enough to be wounded without having to share a ward with
<br>	Bananabrain.
<br> 
<br>Smith: Danke shoen, danke shoen; ich bin (gans?) comfortable. (??)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (slightly puzzled) Yes... (leaves)
<br> 
<br> 
<br>(in Melchett's office)
<br> 
<br>	(knock at door)
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Enter.
<br> 
<br>	(Edmund comes in, but finds the room apparently empty)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (puts his hat down on the desk corner) Hello?
<br> 
<br>	(The camera view changes to just behind the other side of the desk.
<br>	 It's the view of a person. Edmund turns round and the view ducks
<br>	 completely behind the desk for a moment before peeking up again.
<br>	 Across the room, the legs behind a large map include human legs in
<br>	 uniform. Edmund approaches the map. The person through whose eyes
<br>	 we're witnessing this comes out from behind the desk and follows
<br>	 Edmund across the room, and starts to breathe heavily. Edmund sees a
<br>	 panel in the map and slides it open, revealing General Melchett's
<br>	 face. Just then, our eyes' owner, Captain Darling, jumps Edmund
<br>	 from behind. The camera view changes. Darling is holding his
<br>	 revolver as he forces Edmund to the fireplace, where a fire is
<br>	 burning.)
<br> 
<br>Darling: Right! Spread 'em! (he frisks Edmund, taking away his gun; he speaks
<br>	 to Melchett) Right, he's clear, sir.
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Beah!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Can anyone tell me what's going on?
<br> 
<br>Darling: Security, Blackadder.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Security?
<br> 
<br>Melchett: (coming out from behind the map) `Security' isn't a dirty word,
<br>	  Blackadder. `Crevice' is a dirty word, but `security' isn't.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: So, in the name of security, sir, everyone who enters the room has
<br>	to have his bottom fondled by this drooling pervert.
<br> 
<br>Darling: Only doing my job, Blackadder.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Oh, well, how lucky you are, then, that your job is also your hobby.
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Now there's another dirty word: `job'!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Sir, is there something the matter?
<br> 
<br>Melchett: You're damn right there is something the matter. (heads for desk)
<br>	  Something sinister and something grotesque. And what's worse is that
<br>	  it's going on right here under my very nose. (sits behind desk)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (protesting) Sir, your moustache is lovely...
<br> 
<br>Darling: What the general means, Blackadder, is: There's a leak.
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Now `leak' is a positively disgusting word.
<br> 
<br>Darling: The Germans seem to be able to anticipate our every move. We send up
<br>	 an aeroplane, there's a Jerry squadron parked behind the nearest
<br>	 cloud; we move troops to (??), the Germans have bought the
<br>	 whole town's supply of lavatory paper. In short: A German spy is
<br>	 giving away every one of our battle plans.
<br> 
<br>Melchett: You look surprised, Blackadder.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: I certainly am, sir. I didn't realise we had any battle plans.
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Well, of course we have! How else do you think the battles are
<br>	  directed?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Our battles are directed, sir?
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Well, of course they are, Blackadder -- directed according to the
<br>	  Grand Plan.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Would that be the plan to continue with total slaughter until every-
<br>        one's dead except Field Marshal Haig, Lady Haig and their tortoise,
<br>        Alan?
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Great Scott! (stands) Even you know it! Guard! Guard! Bolt all the
<br>	  doors; hammer large pieces of crooked wood against all the windows!
<br>	  This security leak is far worse than we'd imagined!
<br> 
<br>Darling: So you see, Blackadder, Field Marshal Haig is most anxious to
<br>	 eliminate all these German spies.
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Filthy Hun weasels fighting their dirty underhand war!
<br> 
<br>Darling: And, fortunately, one of *our* spies--
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Splendid fellows, brave heroes, risking life and limb for Blighty!
<br> 
<br>Darling: ...has discovered that the leak is coming from the Field Hospital.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: You think there's a German spy in the Field Hospital? I think you
<br>	might be right, there.
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Your job, Blackadder, is to root this spy out. How long do you think
<br>          you'll need?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (looks at his watch) Ooh, er...
<br> 
<br>Melchett: You'll have to be away from the trenches for some time.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Six months?
<br> 
<br>Darling: (??), Blackadder. You've got three weeks.
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Yes, three weeks to smoke the bugger out! Use any method you see
<br>          fit. Personally, I'd recommend you get hold of a cocker spaniel,
<br>	  tie your suspect down on a chair, with a potty on his head, then
<br>	  pop his todger between two flowery (bamps?) and shout, "Dinnertime,
<br>	  Fido!" However, if you are successful, I shall need you back here
<br>	  permanently, to head up my new security network, Operation Winkle.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Winkle?
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Yes -- to winkle out the spies.
<br> 
<br>Darling: (upset that he wasn't offered the position) You never mentioned
<br>	 this to me, sir!
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Well, we have to have some secrets, don't we, Darling...
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Right, well, I'll be back in three weeks. (takes his hat and revolver)
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Excellent. And if you come back with the information, Captain
<br>          Darling will pump you thoroughly in the debriefing room.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Not while I have my strength, he won't. (exits, as Darling points at
<br>	him angrily)
<br> 
<br>Darling: Damnation, sir! His insolence makes my blood boil! Once more, I 
<br>         don't trust him, sir. I think it would be best if I went to the
<br>         hospital myself, to keep an eye on him.
<br> 
<br>Melchett: What, spy on our own spy as he searches for their spy? Yes, why
<br>          not? -- sounds rather fun. You'll have to go under cover...
<br> 
<br>Darling: Oh, definitely, sir.
<br> 
<br>Melchett: You'll need some sort of wound, a convincing wound...
<br> 
<br>Darling: Naturally, sir.
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Yes. (shoots Darling in the foot; Darling screams and falls down,
<br>	  his hand weakly poking up from behind the side of the desk) Yes,
<br>	  that looks quite convincing. (Darling's hand finally falls behind
<br>	  the desk)
<br> 
<br> 
<br>(back in the room at the trenches)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Right, pack me a toothbrush, Baldrick. We're going on holiday.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: Hurray! Where to?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Hospital.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: Oh, no, I hate hostipals. My grandfather went into one, and when he
<br>	  come out, he was dead.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: He was also dead when he went in, Baldrick. He'd been run over by a
<br>	traction engine.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: I don't like them doctors. If they start poking around inside me--
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Baldrick, why would anyone wish to poke around inside you?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: They might find me interesting.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Baldrick, I find the Great Northern and Metropolitan Sewage System
<br>	interesting, but that doesn't mean that I want to put on some
<br>	rubber gloves and pull things out if it with a pair of tweezers.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: Still, I tell you what, sir, you might have a chance to get to know
<br>	  that pretty nurse. (tries to make a cute face)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: No, thank you, Baldrick. She's as wet as a fish's wet bits. I'd rather
<br>        get to know you.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: I'm not available, sir. I'm waiting for Miss Right to come along and
<br>          gather me up in her arms.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Yes, I wouldn't be too hopeful; we'd have to get her arms out of a 
<br>        straightjacket first. Now get packing!
<br> 
<br> 
<br>(at hospital; George is writing another letter, and reading it out to Mary
<br> and Smith)
<br> 
<br>Smith: So very interesting! Please do continue. (??)
<br> 
<br>George: Right, then I go on to say, "The orders came through for us to 
<br>        advance at 0800 hours in a pincer movement."
<br> 
<br>Mary: Gosh, how exciting!
<br> 
<br>George: Yes, well, hmm...
<br> 
<br>	(enter Edmund)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: 'afternoon, George.
<br> 
<br>George: Ah, hello, Cap!
<br> 
<br>Mary: Ah, Captain. I hope you're going to conduct yourself with a little more 
<br>      decorum this time.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: No, I am going to conduct myself with no decorum. Shove off!
<br> 
<br>	(Mary leaves in a huff; Edmund waves his hat at Smith, to make him
<br>	 leave the bedside)
<br> 
<br>Smith: (??), Herr Kapitan! (??)!
<br> 
<br>George: So, Cap, what's going on?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Well, there's a German spy in the hospital and it's my job to find
<br>        him.
<br> 
<br>George: A Ger--? Well, snakes alive! Exciting stuff, eh? Wait a minute;
<br>	I think I might have a plan already.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: What is it?
<br> 
<br>George: Well, have a look through the list of patients and see if there's
<br>        anyone here whose name begins with `von'. Well, it's almost bound
<br>	to be your bloke!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: I think we may find that he's using a false name, actually, George.
<br> 
<br>George: Oh, crikey. Well, that's hardly fair, now, is it...
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: I, too, have a cunning plan to catch the spy, sir.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Do you, Baldrick, do you...
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: You go round the hostipal and ask everyone, "Are you a German spy?"
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Yes, I must say, Baldrick, I appreciate your involvement on the 
<br>        creative side.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: If it was me, I'd own up.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Of course you would. But, sadly, the enemy have not added to the
<br>	German Army Entrance Form the requirement "Must have intellectual
<br>	capacity of a boiled potato." Now, Baldrick, see that man over there?
<br>	(looks at Smith)
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: Yeah.
<br> 
<br>	(Smith is looking at them through field glasses; he waves)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: I want you to stick to him like a limpet, and make sure he doesn't
<br>	leave the hospital.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: Yes, sir.
<br> 
<br>	(As Baldrick walks across to Smith's bed, Darling hobbles in, with
<br>	 help from a cane)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Hello, Darling. What are you doing here?
<br> 
<br>Darling: Bullet in the foot.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Well, I can understand people at the front trying to shoot themselves
<br>        in the foot, but when you're 35 miles behind the line...
<br> 
<br>Darling: I did not shoot myself. The General did it.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Well! Finally got fed up with you, did he?
<br> 
<br>Darling: No, it was a mistake.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Oh, he was aiming for your head...
<br> 
<br>Darling: He wasn't aiming for anything.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Oh, so he was going for between your legs, then.
<br> 
<br>Darling: Very funny, Blackadder. You'll be laughing on the other side of your
<br>         face if you don't find this spy.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Don't you worry, Darling. I intend to start interviewing suspects
<br>	immediately.
<br> 
<br> 
<br>(later, in another room in the hospital; Darling is tied to a chair, with a
<br> potty on his head)
<br> 
<br>Darling: This is completely ridiculous, Blackadder! You can't suspect me. I've
<br>         only just arrived.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: The first rule of counterespionage, Darling, is to suspect everyone.
<br>	Believe me, I shall be asking myself pretty searching questions later
<br>	on. Now, tell me: What is the colour of the Queen of England's
<br>	favourite hat?
<br> 
<br>Darling: How the hell should I know?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: I see. Well, let me ask you another question: What is the name of the
<br>	German Head of State?
<br> 
<br>Darling: Well, Kaiser Wilhelm, obviously.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (stands) So you're on first-name terms with the Kaiser, are you?
<br> 
<br>Darling: (shouts) Well, what did you expect me to say?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Darling, Darling, shh... (offers) Cigarette?
<br> 
<br>Darling: (as Edmund puts cigarette in his mouth and begins to light it)
<br>	 Thank you.
<br> 
<br>	(pause)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (suddenly knocks the cigarette out of Darling's mouth) All right, you
<br>	stinking piece of crap!
<br> 
<br>Darling: I beg your pardon?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Shut your cakehole, sonny! I know you! Tell me, von Darling:
<br>        What was it finally won you over, eh? Was it the pumpernickel, or
<br>	was it the thought of hanging around with big men in leather shorts?
<br> 
<br>Darling: I'll have you courtmartialed for this, Blackadder!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: What, for obeying the general's orders? That may be what you do in
<br>	Munich -- or should I say Muechen? -- but not here, Wernher! You're
<br>	a filthy Hun spy, aren't you! (calls) Baldrick, the cocker spaniel,
<br>	please!
<br> 
<br>Darling: Agh! No! No, no, wait! No, look, I'm engaged! I was born in Croydon;
<br>	 I was educated in (???) primary school; I've got a girlfriend called
<br>	 Doris; I know the words to all three verses of God Save the King!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (enjoying this) Four verses...
<br> 
<br>Darling: Four verses! Four verses! I meant four verses! Look, I'm as British
<br>         as Queen Victoria.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: So your father's German, you're half German, and you married a German?
<br> 
<br>Darling: (crying) No! No! Look, for God's sake, I'm not a German spy!!!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Good. Thanks very much. Send in the next man, would you?
<br> 
<br>	(Mary enters)
<br> 
<br>Mary: What is all this noise about? Don't you realise this is a hospital?
<br> 
<br>Darling: (stands, still tied to the chair) You'll regret this, Blackadder.
<br>	 You'd better find the real spy or I'll make it very hard for you.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (protesting) Please, Darling -- there are ladies present.
<br> 
<br>Darling: (?)
<br> 
<br>(Darling waddles out. Mary takes the potty off his head as he goes. Somewhere
<br> down the hallway, a crash is heard accompanied by a scream from Darling.
<br> Mary closes the door.)
<br> 
<br>Mary: Well, well, Captain Blackadder, this is an unexpected pleasure.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: What?
<br> 
<br>Mary: Nice to have you back with us. A spycatcher, eh? Huh! That silly
<br>      kid George was right -- you are a bally hero.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Wait a minute. I thought you liked George.
<br> 
<br>Mary: That's just my bedside manner. What I call my `fluffy bunny act'.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: So you're not a drip after all.
<br> 
<br>Mary: Oh, no. So, Mr Spycatcher, how's it going?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Well, not much luck so far. I think he might be as difficult to find
<br>	as a piece of hay in a massive stack full of needles.
<br> 
<br>Mary: So you're going to be around for quite a while, then.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Looks like it.
<br> 
<br>Mary: Good, because, er, it can get pretty lonely round here, you know. 
<br>      God, it's nice to have someone healthy to talk to. (offers) Cigarette?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: No, thank you. I only smoke cigarettes after making love. So, back in
<br>        England, I'm a twenty-a-day man.
<br> 
<br>Mary: (blows smoke in Edmund's face) A man should smoke. It acts as an
<br>      expectorant and gives his voice a deep, gravely, masculine tone.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: God, I love nurses; they're so digustingly clinical!
<br> 
<br>Mary: Tell me, Captain Blackadder...
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Edmund.
<br> 
<br>Mary: Edmund. When this war is over do you think we might get to know each
<br>      other a little better?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Yes, why not? When this madness is finished, perhaps we could go
<br>	cycling together, take a trip down to the Old Swan at Henley and go
<br>	for a walk in the woods.
<br> 
<br>Mary: Yes, or we could just do it right now on the desk.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (looks at the desk) Yeah, OK.
<br> 
<br> 
<br>(in the ward; Smith hobbles in hurriedly, followed immediately by Baldrick)
<br> 
<br>George: Ah, Baldrick. Have you seen Nurse Mary? I need someone to post this 
<br>        letter.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: She's in the office with the captain, sir.
<br> 
<br>George: Ah, poor girl -- tied to her desk, day and night...
<br> 
<br>	(Edmund enters)
<br> 
<br>George: Ah, Cap! I hear you've been seeing a lot of Nurse Mary.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Yes -- almost all of her, in fact.
<br> 
<br>George: How is she, sir?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Unbelievable!
<br> 
<br>George: (motions Edmund to come closer, then speaks softly) What I really want
<br>	to know is, are you any closer to finding the spy?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Yes, I think I'm getting there, George. (looks across, calls)
<br>	Everything all right, Smith?
<br> 
<br>Smith: (Baldrick is in bed with him, reading a Punch magazine) Oh, ja,
<br>       excellent, excellent.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Jolly good. (leaves)
<br> 
<br>George: Smithy, you haven't seen any suspicious characters hanging around,
<br>        have you, who might be German spies?
<br> 
<br>Smith: Nein.
<br> 
<br>George: (bewildered) Nine?! Well, the cap's got his work cut out, then.
<br> 
<br> 
<br>(in the office, Mary and Edmund are in bed; Edmund is smoking)
<br> 
<br>Mary: Tell me, Edmund: Do you have someone special in your life?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Well, yes, as a matter of fact, I do.
<br> 
<br>Mary: Who?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Me.
<br> 
<br>Mary: No, I mean someone you love, cherish and want to keep safe from all the 
<br>      horror and the hurt.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Erm... Still me, really.
<br> 
<br>Mary: No, but, back home, in England, there must be someone waiting --
<br>      some sweetheart.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Oh, a girl... Nah. I've always been a soldier -- married to the army.
<br>        The book of King's Regulations is my mistress, possibly with a 
<br>        Harrod's lingerie catalogue discreetly tucked between the pages.
<br> 
<br>Mary: And no casual girlfriends...?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Skirt? Hah! If only... When I joined up, we were still fighting
<br>	colonial wars. If you saw someone in a skirt, you shot him and
<br>	nicked his country. What about you? Have you got a man? Some fine
<br>	fellow in an English country village? A vicar, maybe? Quiet, gentle,
<br>	hung like a babboon...
<br> 
<br>Mary: There was a man I cared for a little. Wonderful chap -- strong,
<br>      athletic...
<br> 
<br>Edmund: What happened to him?
<br> 
<br>Mary: He bought it.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: I'm so sorry; I didn't realise that was the arrangement. (stands,
<br>	goes to desk) Erm, so what's it been? Twelve nights, let's say
<br>	nine afternoons... How much is--? Oh, and a couple of mornings...
<br> 
<br>Mary: I mean he died.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (apologising only for his actions -- not the death) Oh, I'm sorry.
<br> 
<br>Mary: He was test-driving one of those new tank contraptions, and the bloody
<br>      thing blew up. What a waste. God, I hope they've scrapped the lot.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Huh, fat chance! They're going to use forty of them next week at, oh,
<br>	sorry, I mustn't talk about that; you never know who might be
<br>	listening. (There is a black dot, possibly a hole, in the wall behind
<br>	him -- possibly the location of a microphone, or maybe it's just a
<br>	problem with the set.)
<br> 
<br>Mary: No, of course. Oh God, I miss him so much. He was such a wonderful chap.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Clever, too, I expect.
<br> 
<br>Mary: Oh, brilliant.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Went to one of the great universities, I suppose: Oxford; Cambridge;
<br>        Hull...
<br> 
<br>Mary: Mmm... But why are we making small talk when we could be making big 
<br>      love?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Good point. This could be our last chance; my three weeks are up.
<br>	I'm going back to staff HQ tomorrow. Look, why don't you come with me?
<br>	It could be fun. We could have supper or something.
<br> 
<br>Mary: How about something first, then supper?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Good idea!
<br> 
<br> 
<br>(in Melchett's office; Melchett enters to meet the waiting Edmund and Mary)
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Ah, hello, Blackadder...
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Good morning, sir. Er, may I introduce Nurse Fletcher-Brown. She's 
<br>        been very supportive during my work at the hospital.
<br> 
<br>Melchett: How do you do, young lady? (chuckles) Do sit down. (he moans in pain
<br>	  as he sits) So, any news of the spy, Blackadder?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Yes, sir.
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Excellent! The Germans seem to know every move we make! I had a  
<br>          letter from Jerry yesterday. It said, "Isn't it about time you
<br>	  changed your shirts, Walrus-face?" So, do you have any ideas who
<br>	  it might be, young lady?
<br> 
<br>Mary: Well, sir, I'm only a humble nurse, but I did at one point think it
<br>      might be Captain Darling.
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Well, bugger me with a fishfork! Old Darling, a Jerry morsetapper?
<br>          What on Earth made you suspect him?
<br> 
<br>Mary: Well, he pooh-poohed the captain here and said that he'd never find
<br>      the spy.
<br>        
<br>Melchett: Is this true, Blackadder? Did Captain Darling pooh-pooh you?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Well, perhaps a little.
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Well then, damn it all, how much more evidence do you need? The
<br>	  pooh-poohing alone is a court-martial offence!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: I can assure you, sir, that the pooh-poohing was purely circumstantial.
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Well, I hope so, Blackadder. You know, if there's one thing I've
<br>	  learned from being in the army, it's never ignore a pooh-pooh.
<br>	  I knew a major: got pooh-poohed; made the mistake of ignoring the
<br>	  pooh-pooh -- he pooh-poohed it. Fatal error, because it turned out
<br>	  all along that the soldier who pooh-poohed him had been pooh-poohing
<br>	  a lot of other officers, who pooh-poohed their pooh-poohs. In the
<br>	  end, we had to disband the regiment -- morale totally destroyed ...
<br>	  by pooh-pooh!
<br> 
<br>	(Mary has begun reading an Ideas magazine. During the next line,
<br>	 she looks around nervously and puts the paper down, sitting on it)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Yes, I think we might be drifting slightly from the point here, sir,
<br>	which is that, unfortuantely, and to my lasting regret, Captain
<br>	Darling is not the spy.
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Oh? And then who the hell is?
<br> 
<br>Mary: Well, sir, there is a man in the hospital with a pronounced limp and
<br>      a very strong German accent. It must be him. It's obvious.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Obvious, but wrong. It's not him.
<br> 
<br>Melchett: And why not?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Because, sir, not even the Germans would be stupid enough to field a
<br>        spy with a strong German accent.
<br> 
<br>Mary: Well then, who is it?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Well, it's perfectly simple. It's you.
<br> 
<br>Mary: (gasps; stands) Edmund!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (calls as he stands) Baldrick!
<br> 
<br>	(Baldrick enters, pointing a rifle at Mary)
<br> 
<br>Melchett: (stands) Explain yourself, Blackadder, before I have you shot for
<br>	  being rude to a lady!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Well, sir, the first seeds of suspicion were sown when Lieutenant
<br>	George unwittingly revealed that she spoke German. Do you deny, Nurse
<br>	Fletcher-Brown -- or should I say Nurse Fleischer-Baum? -- that you
<br>	helped Lieutenant George with the German words in his letters?
<br> 
<br>Mary: No, I did, but--
<br> 
<br>Edmund: My suspicions were confirmed when she probed me expertly about tank 
<br>        movements.
<br> 
<br>Murse: Oh, Edmund, how could you? After all we've been through.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: And then the final, irrefutable proof. Remember, you mentioned
<br>	a clever boyfriend...
<br> 
<br>Mary: Yes.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: I then leapt on the opportunity to test you. I asked if he'd been
<br>        to one of the great universities: Oxford, Cambridge, or Hull...
<br> 
<br>Mary: Well?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: You failed to spot that only two of those are great universities.
<br> 
<br>Mary: You swine!
<br> 
<br>Melchett: That's right -- Oxford's a complete dump!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Well, quite. No true Englishwoman could have fallen into that trap.
<br> 
<br>Mary: Oh, Edmund, I thought there was something beautiful between us.
<br>      I thought you ... loved me.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Nah... Take her away, Baldrick.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: (?? [mispronouncing something in German, perhaps])
<br> 
<br>	(Baldrick takes Mary out)
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Well, good work, Blackadder. Now I've got to assemble a firing
<br>	  squad. (while Edmund warms himself by the fire, goes to his desk,
<br>	  sits and picks up the telephone)
<br> 
<br>	(Smith, in uniform, hobbles in. Darling runs up from behind)
<br> 
<br>Darling: Watch out, sir!  (jumps on Smith, taking his revolver)
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Darling, what on Earth do you think you're doing?
<br> 
<br>Darling: I'll tell you exactly what I am doing, sir. I'm doing what Blackadder
<br>         should have done three weeks ago, sir.
<br> 
<br>Melchett: What?
<br> 
<br>Darling: This is the guilty man!
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Darling, you're hysterical.
<br> 
<br>Darling: No, sir! No, I'm not, sir! I'll ask him outright: Are you a spy?
<br> 
<br>Smith: Yes, I am a spy!
<br> 
<br>Darling: You see, sir??
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Well, of course he's a spy, Darling -- a British spy! This is
<br>          Brigadier Sir Bernard Proudfoot-Smith (Smith stands up straight,
<br>	  showing that he in fact doesn't limp at all), the finest spy in
<br>	  the British army!
<br> 
<br>Darling: b-But he can't be, sir; he, he doesn't even sound British.
<br> 
<br>Smith: (still sounding as German as ever) Unfortunately, I have been working
<br>       under cover in Germany for so long that I have picked up a teensy-
<br>       weensy bit of an accent.
<br> 
<br>Melchett: This, Darling, is the man who told us that there was a German spy in
<br>	  the hospital in the first place.
<br> 
<br>Darling: Ah.
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Right. Well, that's that, then. Blackadder...
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Yes, sir?
<br> 
<br>Melchett: You are now head of Operation Winkle.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Thank you, sir.
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Darling...
<br> 
<br>Darling: Yes, sir?
<br> 
<br>Melchett: You are a complete arse.
<br> 
<br>Darling: Thank you, sir.
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Right, Bernard, let's go watch the firing squad. (starts out)
<br> 
<br>Smith: (??), von General! (takes his revolver from Darling; leaves)
<br> 
<br>	(George rushes in)
<br> 
<br>George: Sir, what the devil is going on? I've just seen Nurse Mary being led
<br>	away to a firing squad!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Nurse Mary is the spy, George.
<br> 
<br>George: What? Y-- Impossible!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Afraid so.
<br> 
<br>George: Well, cover me with eggs and flour and bake me for fourteen minutes.
<br>        Who'd have thought it, eh? Nurse Mary, a Boche nosepokerinner...
<br>	Ker! Oh well, lots of exciting stuff to put into my next letter to my
<br>	Uncle Hermann in Munich...
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Sorry?
<br> 
<br>George: Those letters I've been writing in the hospital, to my German uncle.
<br> 
<br>Darling: New information, Blackadder...?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: George...
<br> 
<br>George: Oh, yes, well, I know there's a war on, but family is family, and
<br>	old Uncle Hermie does so love to be kept abreast of what's going on.
<br>	I even wrote and told him about old walrus-face Melchett and his
<br>	smelly old shirts!
<br> 
<br>Darling: Would you like me to tell this one to the general, Blackadder, or
<br>         would you enjoy that very special moment?
<br> 
<br>	(They race out, leaving George bewildered behind)
