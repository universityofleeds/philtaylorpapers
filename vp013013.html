The 21st Annual NATO JSPOC conference discusses challenges inherent in NATO's roles and missions to discover new approaches in leveraging PSYOPS against asymmetric threat and was held at the Air Force Special Operations School. (U.S. Air Force photo/Senior Airman Sheila DeVera) (RELEASED) <br> <br><br>by Capt. Laura Ropelis<br>Air Force Special Operations Command Public Affairs<br><br>12/9/2008 - HURLBURT FIELD, Fla. -- Even when NATO representatives speak several different languages, they all understand, "to fight a network of the mind, you need a network of the mind," said Dr. Philip M. Taylor, professor of International Communications at the University of Leeds, U.K. <br><br>Senior NATO, military and civilian leaders from 10 countries met to discuss strategic communications at the 21st NATO Joint Senior Psychological Operations Conference Dec. 1-5, hosted by the U.S. Air Force Special Operations School here. <br><br>The annual conference provides strategic communicators the opportunity to encourage dialogue with experts and share their views, opinions and experiences, and discover new approaches to asymmetric threats. <br><br>Dr. Taylor's view of strategic communications is as an umbrella under which different components for communications work together to form effective communication. <br><br>Communications is like an orchestra, said Col. Stephen Padgett, a U.K army officer working at U.S. Strategic Command. He stressed the importance of making sure "what we are saying is what was heard," particularly in cross-cultural global environments. <br><br>"If we don't make something that captures the ear, we are just white noise," he said. "The audience chooses what they like best." <br><br>Col. Padgett stressed the importance of coordination and cooperation within NATO communications against asymmetric threats. <br><br>"Like an orchestra, all instruments retain their unique sounds and specialties, but they communicate more effectively in concert," he said. <br><br>Each NATO country is like an instrument providing information that is important in a strategic communications context, the colonel said. <br><br>"Recognize the true criticality of information," said Dr. Mark Laity of NATO Supreme Allied Powers Europe. "Credibility comes from accuracy." <br><br>To make a difference, strategic communications takes "innovative thinking and alternatives," he said. <br><br>Networking with communities of experts provides consistent, effective communication, according to Dr. Laity. Operating more like a modern business provides speed, response and flexible expertise, he said. <br>We need to "walk the talk," said Dr. Taylor. "If policy is wrong, you can't sell it." <br><br>Communications and policy have a direct impact on each other, according to Dr. Taylor, and must be responsive in the changing global environment. <br><br>The Brown Beck Bill, a new strategic communications bill in Congress, was highlighted during the conference as an example of changing relationships between policy and strategic communications, said Dr. Taylor. <br><br>"Commercial markets drive our future," said Lt. Col. Robert A. McMaster from Air Force Special Operations Command. The colonel said the flying broadcast platform, the EC-130J Commando Solo, leads to mission success. <br><br>"We are simultaneously looking at all technologies applicable to strategically communicate while supporting current technology platforms," he said. <br><br>To defeat the threat of terrorism on the asymmetric battlefield, a defeat will take place with the "war of words," said Col. McMaster. <br><br>Asymmetric threats discussed include terrorism that use propaganda as a weapon. These non-kinetic threats promote ideology and recruit members to follow a cause through large global networks. <br><br>This conference provided NATO leaders working in strategic communications an opportunity to discuss the way ahead. <br><br>"By connecting NATO, military and civilian communications leaders, this conference provides a cohesive global forum to discuss how to address and influence asymmetric threats with strategic communications," said Capt. Stephanie Allison, course director. <br><br>"This conference is a great initiative for the future and the here-and-now," said Brig. Gen. Gary A. Medvigy, deputy commanding general for the U. S. Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command. <br><br>"The future of psychological operations is reflected here in the NATO community and a unified joint headquarters. Working together, we can leverage each of our capabilities and design an effective platform for strategic communications," the general said. <br><br><br>
