<br>
<br>Beer
<br>	[Edmund's house.  Lords Percy Percy and Edmund Blackadder are
<br>	 eating breakfast.]
<br> 
<br>Percy:	I must say, Edmund, it was jolly nice of you to ask me to share your
<br>	breakfast before the rigours of the day begin.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Well, it is said, Percy, that civilised man seeks out good and
<br>	 intelligent company, so that, through learned discourse, he may
<br>	 rise above the savage and closer to God.
<br> 
<br>Percy:	Yes, I've heard that.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Personally, however, I like to start the day with a total dickhead
<br>	 to remind me I'm best.
<br> 
<br>Percy:  Beshrew me, Edmund!  You're in good fooling this morning.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Don't say `beshrew me', Percy -- only stupid actors say `beshrew me'.
<br> 
<br>Percy:  Oh, how I would love to be an actor!  I had a great talent for it in
<br>	my youth -- I was the man of a thousand faces.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  How'd you come to choose the ugly mug you've got now, then?
<br>	 [He begins reading a note.]
<br> 
<br>Percy:  Hah hah! Tush, My Lord.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  ...and don't say `tush', either!  It's only a short step from `tush'
<br>	 to `hey nonny nonny'; and then, I'm afraid, I'll shall have to call
<br>	 the police.
<br>	 [Looks at the note once more.]
<br>	 Well!  God pats me on the head and says, "Good boy, Edmund!"
<br> 
<br>Percy:	My Lord...?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  My aunt and uncle, Lord and Lady Whiteadder, the two most fanatical
<br>	 puritans in England, have invited themselves to dinner here tonight.
<br> 
<br>Percy:	But aren't they the most frightful bores?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Yep, but they have one great redeeming feature -- their wallets.
<br>	 More capacious than an elephant's scrotum, and just as difficult
<br>	 to get your hands on...at least until now, for, tonight, they wish
<br>	 to discuss my inheritance.  [runs his fingers through his hair]
<br> 
<br>Percy:  [stands quickly] Hey nonny nonny, My Lord! Good news!
<br>	[he holds out a hand as though expecting Edmund to shake it]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [calls] Baldrick!
<br> 
<br>	[Baldrick enters, wearing an apparatus on his head which is dangling
<br>	 a piece of cheese from the end of his nose.  Edmund begins to speak
<br>	 about something, then notices.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [calmly]  Why have you got a piece of cheese tied to the end
<br>	 of your nose?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  To catch mice, My Lord.  I lie on the floor with my mouth open
<br>	   and hope they scurry in.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  ...and do they?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Not yet, My Lord.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Well, I'm not surprised -- your breath comes straight from Satan's
<br>	 bottom, Baldrick.  The only sort of mouse you're going to catch is
<br>	 one without a nose.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  That's a pity, because the nose is the best bit on a mouse.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Any bit of a mouse would seem like luxury compared to what Percy
<br>	 and I must eat tonight.  We are entertaining puritan vegetable folk,
<br>	 Balders; and that means no meat.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  In that case, I shall prepare my Turnip Surprise.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  and the surprise is...?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  ...there's nothing else in it except the turnip.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  So, in other words, the Turnip Surprise would be...a turnip.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  [realisation]  Oh yeah...
<br> 
<br>	[There is a knock at the door.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Get the door, Baldrick, get the door...
<br> 
<br>	[Baldrick leaves.]
<br> 
<br>Percy:  Well, now, if things go as planned tonight, it seems congratulations
<br>	are in order...
<br>	[he holds out a hand as though expecting Edmund to shake it]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Nice try, Percy, but forget it -- you're not getting a penny.
<br>	 [he goes to sit in the chair at the doorway to the room]
<br> 
<br>	[A tremendous noise of wood being bent and broken fills the room.
<br>	 Baldrick enters, carrying a door.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [looks at what Baldrick is carrying; is not surprised; speaks calmly]
<br>	 Baldrick, I would advise you to make the explanation you are about
<br>	 to give phenomenally good.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  You said, "Get the door."
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Not good enough.  You're fired.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  But, My Lord, I've been in your family since 1532!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  So has syphilis.  Now get out.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  [obscured by laughter], My Lord.  [starts to leave but returns]
<br>	   Oh, by the way: there was a messenger outside when I got the door.
<br>	   He says the Queen wants to see you; Lord Melchett is very sick.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [stands up excited]  Really...!
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Yeah -- he's at Death's door.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Well, my faithful old reinstated family retainer, let's go and
<br>	 open it for him, then!
<br> 
<br> 
<br>	[Scene changes to a large room.  Melchett is lying on a bed with
<br>	 a hand on his head.  Queen Elizabeth is fanning his face with her
<br>	 hand.  Nursie pushes on Melchett's stomach.  Edmund enters.]
<br> 
<br>Queen:  Edmund!  Quick! Quick!  Melchett's dying!  We must do something!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Well, yes, of course... er, some sort of celebration...
<br>	 But let's wait until he's actually snuffed it, shall we?
<br> 
<br>Queen:  Nursie's old methods don't seem to be working...
<br> 
<br>Nursie:  Come on, little tummy...
<br> 
<br>Queen:	[goes across the room, to speak privately with Edmund]
<br>	It all started last night at about two o'clock.  I was tucked
<br>	into bed having this absolutely scrummy dream about ponies when
<br>	I was wakened by a terrific banging from Lord Melchett.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [grins at the double entendre]  Well! I never knew he had it in him.
<br> 
<br>Queen:  It's true, I promise!  He was banging on the castle gate, falling
<br>	over, and singing a strange song about a girl who possessed something
<br>	called a...dicky-di-do?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Oh, yes, it's a lovely old hymn, isn't it...  [returns to the bed]
<br>	 Well, Ma'am, I think I know what's wrong with Lord Melchett,
<br>	 and, unfortunately, it isn't fatal.
<br> 
<br>Queen:	Well, hurry up and cure the horrible man -- I'm fed up with him lying
<br>	there moaning and groaning...
<br> 
<br>Nursie:  ...and letting off such great and fruitsome flappy woof-woofs!
<br>	 One can scarcely...one can't believe one's tiny nosy!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  The truth is: Lord Melchett just can't take his ale.
<br> 
<br>Melchett:  [sitting up]  Madam, I protest!  I may be a little delicate this
<br>	   morning, but what I drank last night would have floored a
<br>	   rhinocerous!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  ...if it was allergic to lemonade...
<br> 
<br>Melchett:  It's Blackadder here who can't take his ale -- he's famous for it!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Oh yeah?
<br> 
<br>Melchett:  Yeah!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Yeah?
<br> 
<br>Melchett:  Yeah!
<br> 
<br>Queen:  Oh, [???] this is so exciting -- the boys are getting tough!
<br> 
<br>Melchett:  Well, I'm sure we all remember the shame and embarrassment of the
<br>	   visit of the King of Austria when Blackadder was found wandering
<br>	   naked among the corridors of Hampton Court singing, "I'm Merlin,
<br>	   The Happy Pig!"
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  So, what did you have last night, then? a whole half-pint of 
<br>	 potato juice?
<br> 
<br>Melchett:  On the contrary! I had two flagons of claret and a double helping
<br>	   of curried turtle!  I can assure you: it's no holds barred with
<br>	   us at the annual communion-wine tasting.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Annual! Hah!  For me and the wild boys, every night is drinking
<br>	 night!
<br> 
<br>Melchett:  Says who?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Says me!
<br> 
<br>Melchett:  Says you?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Yeah!
<br> 
<br>Melchett:  [expecting that Edmund is bragging]  eeaaaahh...
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  You ought to come around sometime and have a look at the
<br>	 underside of >my< table!
<br> 
<br>Melchett:  Bah...
<br> 
<br>Queen:  ...tonight!!!
<br> 
<br>Melchett:  [suddenly in his senses, speaks feebly]  Er, tonight?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [not in his senses]  Yeah! Come on, Melchy -- what are you
<br>	 scared of?
<br> 
<br>Queen:  Perhaps you're right.  [in a child's taunt] Perhaps he's a [????].
<br> 
<br>Melchett:  Oh, all right then -- tonight.  I'll be there.
<br> 
<br>Queen:  Hurray.  and last one under the table gets...ten thousand florins
<br>	from the loser.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [shocked]  Ma'am...?  Er... right...  Well, I'll get the beer in,
<br>	 then.  [bows, puts a thumb to his nose and wiggles his fingers at
<br>         Melchett.  Leaves]
<br> 
<br>Queen:  [Stands at the door]  Nursie...
<br> 
<br>Nursie:  Hmm?  [goes to speak privately with Queen]
<br> 
<br>Queen:	[whispering]  Do you know what I'm going to do?
<br> 
<br>Nursie:  What?
<br> 
<br>Queen:  I'm going to go along and find out exactly what happens at these
<br>	boys' nights.
<br> 
<br>Nursie:  Good idea, poppet.
<br> 
<br>Queen:	...and I'll wear a cloak with a cowl, so no-one will recognise me.
<br> 
<br>Nursie:  Oh, that's another good idea.  You're so clever today, you better
<br>	 be careful your foot doesn't fall off.
<br> 
<br>Queen:  Does that happen when you have lots of brilliant ideas?
<br>	Your foot falls off?
<br> 
<br>Nursie:  It certainly does.  My brother, he had this brilliant idea of
<br>	 cutting his toenails with a scythe, and >his< foot fell off...
<br> 
<br> 
<br>	[Scene changes to Edmund's house.  Percy has quill in hand, taking
<br>	 notes for Edmund, who paces the room.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Right, now; the sort of person we're looking for is an aggressive
<br>	 drunken lout with the intelligence of a four year old and the
<br>	 sexual sophistication of a donkey.
<br> 
<br>Percy:  [thinks]  Cardinal Woolsey...  [writes]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [calls]  Baldrick!
<br> 
<br>	[Baldrick enters, but his apparatus is dangling a mouse this time.]
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  My Lord...?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Why?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  I got fed up with the all-mouse diet, My Lord.  I thought I'd try
<br>	   cat for variety.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Good. Well done. and now, returning to the real world: Do you have
<br>	 a knife?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Yeah.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Good, because I wish to quickly send off some party invitations,
<br>	 and, to make them look particularly tough, I wish to write them
<br>	 in blood -- your blood, to be precise.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  So, how much blood will you actually be requiring, My Lord?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Oh, nothing much -- just a small puddle.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Will you want me to cut anything off? an arm or a leg, for
<br>	   instance?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Oh, good lord, no -- a little prick should do.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Very well, My Lord; I am your bondsman and must obey. [sticks his
<br>	   knife down his trousers and begins sawing]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  For God's sake, Baldrick! I meant a little prick on your finger!
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  [nearly crying]  I haven't got one there!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Forget it, forget it...  [motions for Baldrick to leave]
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Thank you, My Lord.  [leaves]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Right, now; Perce... How's this list going?
<br> 
<br>Percy:	Oh, very well indeed.  I thought we could invite my girlfriend,
<br>	Gwendoline...
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Sorry -- no chicks.  Who else?
<br> 
<br>Percy:  Well, that's about as far as I'd got, actually.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Right.  I'll dictate.  First: Simon Partridge.
<br> 
<br>Percy:  Oh, not Farter's Parters, also known as Mr Ostrich...!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Even he...
<br> 
<br>Percy:  But he's a fearful oik!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Takes one to know one, Perce.  Secondly: Sir Geoffrey Piddle.
<br> 
<br>Percy:	Here's-To-The-Health-Of-Cardinal-Chunder Piddle?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  The very same...  and, thirdly: Freddie Frobisher, the Flatulent
<br>	 Hermit of Lindisfarne.
<br> 
<br>Percy:  [holds his nose]  Oh, paugh paugh!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Right. That should do the trick.
<br> 
<br>Percy:	Oh! and, of course, Lord and Lady Whiteadder, who'll be coming
<br>	anyway...
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Oh y--  ...oh, no...
<br> 
<br> 
<br>	[Scene changes to the throne room.  Queen is on the throne, Nursie
<br>	 is in her normal chair to the left (she is knitting), and Edmund
<br>	 is kneeled on one knee before Queen.]
<br> 
<br>Queen:	I must say, Edmund, it does look a teeny bit like trying to get
<br>	out of it.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [frantic]  Quite the wrong impression, Ma'am.  I just want to
<br>	 make it another night, that's all.
<br> 
<br>Nursie:  Certainly not!
<br> 
<br>Queen:	I beg your pardon...?
<br> 
<br>Nursie:  Well, it's just one excuse after another, isn't it?  Next thing,
<br>	 he'll be trying to get out of having his bath altogether.
<br> 
<br>	[Edmund is quite confused.]
<br> 
<br>Queen:	He isn't talking about baths, Nursie.
<br> 
<br>Nursie:  Well, he should be!  How else is he going to keep clean?
<br>	 Soon he'll be saying he doesn't want his nappy changed!
<br> 
<br>Queen:  Lord Blackadder doesn't wear a nappy.
<br> 
<br>Nursie:  Well, in that case, it's even more important that he has a bath!
<br> 
<br>Queen:	[tired of the interruptions]  Oh, shut up, Nursie.
<br>	[to Edmund]  I know why you want to get out of it, because I
<br>	remember the last time you had a party -- I found you face-down
<br>	in a puddle, wearing a pointy hat and singing a song about goblins.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [stands]  Yes, all right! All right!  Tonight it is.
<br> 
<br>Queen:  [smiles, a bit turned on]  Oh, Edmund... I do love it when you get
<br>	cross.  Sometimes I think about having you executed just to see the
<br>	expression on your face.
<br> 
<br>	[Edmund grins uneasily.]
<br> 
<br> 
<br>	[Scene changes to the room in Edmund's house to the right after
<br>	 entering through the main door.  Edmund, Baldrick and Percy enter.
<br>	 Baldrick no longer wears his apparatus.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Right, now; let's make sure you've got this.  We are having two
<br>	 parties here tonight...
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Right.
<br> 
<br>Percy:  Right.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  ...and they must be kept completely separate.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick & Percy:  Right.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Firstly, a total piss-up -- involving beer throwing, broken furniture
<br>	 and wall-to-wall vomiting -- to be held here in Baldrick's bedroom.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Oh, thank you very much, My Lord!  [Percy pats him on the shoulder
<br>	   in congratulations]
<br> 
<br>	[Edmund goes to the main living room of the house (where the previous
<br>	 house scenes have taken place).]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Secondly, Percy will join me in here for the gourmet turnip eating.
<br>	 Is the Turnip Surprise ready?
<br> 
<br>	[Baldrick and Percy begin giggling.]
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Yes, it is, My Lord.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Then what is so funny?
<br> 
<br>Percy:  Well, My Lord, while Baldrick and I were preparing the Turnip
<br>	Surprise, >we< had a surprise -- we came across a turnip that was
<br>	exactly the same shape...as a thingy!
<br> 
<br>	[Percy and Baldrick laugh.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [not amused]  ...a thingy...
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  ...a great big thingy!  It was terrific.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Size is no guarantee of quality, Baldrick.  Most horses are very
<br>	 well endowed, but that does not necessarily make them sensitive
<br>	 lovers.  I trust you have removed this hilarious item...?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Oh, yes, yes, My Lord.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Good, because there's nothing more likely to stop an inheritance
<br>	 than a thingy-shaped turnip.
<br> 
<br>Percy:  Absolutely, Edmund.  ...but it was jolly funny!  [laughs more]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Yes, yes, yes...
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  I found it particularly ironic, My Lord, because I've got
<br>	   a thingy that's shaped like a turnip!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Yes, all right...
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  I'm quite [?] at parties...
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [not interested]  are you...
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Yeah -- I hide in the vegetable rack and frighten the children.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  What fun...  Perhaps you've forgotten that I'm meant to be having
<br>	 a drinking competition here tonight with Lord Melchett, and ten
<br>	 thousand florins are at stake!
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Oh dear...
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  What do you mean?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Well, firstly: you haven't got ten thousand florins; and,
<br>	   thirdly: one drop of the ale and you fall flat on your face
<br>	   and start singing that song about the goblin.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  That's nonsense.  ... ... ... but just in case it's true--
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  [to Percy]  It is true -- I saw it!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Yes, all right, all right, it's true, it's true...
<br>	 So, the plan is: When I call for my Incredibly Strong Ale,
<br>	 you must pass me water in an ale bottle.  Have you got that?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Yeah -- when you call for ale, I pass water.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Percy, your job is to stay here and suck up to my aunt.
<br> 
<br>Percy:  [tries to act suave]  Ah, I think you can trust me to know how to
<br>	handle a woman.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Oh god...
<br> 
<br>	[There is a knock at the door.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Right, here goes...
<br> 
<br>	[Edmund goes to the front door.  Baldrick brushes Edmund's clothing
<br>	 for a moment.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [motioning for Baldrick to stop]  It's all right...
<br> 
<br>	[Baldrick opens the closet door and tosses the brush in.
<br>	 Edmund opens the front door.  Aunt and Uncle's clothing is
<br>	 all white, with a large cross around the neck, a cross sticking
<br>	 out of each shoulder, and a white helmet with a cross sticking
<br>	 out the top.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Uncle! Aunt!  Greetings!  How nice it is to see you.
<br>	 [He leans over and kisses Aunt on each cheek.]
<br> 
<br>Aunt:  [slaps Edmund twice]  Wicked child!!!  Don't lie!  Everyone hates us,
<br>       and you know it!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Oh yes.  Er, may I introduce my friend Lord Percy...?
<br> 
<br>Percy:  [suave]  Well well well, Eddy!  You didn't tell me you had
<br>	such a good-looking aunt!
<br> 
<br>	[Edmund waves at him to shut up.  Aunt is shocked.]
<br> 
<br>Percy:	Good morrow to thee, gorgeousness!  I know what I like,
<br>	and I like what I see!
<br> 
<br>Aunt:  [slaps Percy]  Be gone, Satan!  [heads to the main room]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Er, yes, well, well, I hope you had a pleasant inheritance...
<br>	 Did I say `inheritance'?  I meant `journey'.
<br>	 [motions around the table]  If you'd just like to help yourself
<br>	 to a legacy -- er, a chair...
<br> 
<br>Aunt:  `Chair'?  You have chairs in your house?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Oh, yes.
<br> 
<br>Aunt:  [slaps him twice]  Wicked child!!!  Chairs are an invention of Satan!
<br>       In our house, Nathaniel sits on a spike!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  ...and yourself...?
<br> 
<br>Aunt:  I sit on Nathaniel -- two spikes would be an extravagance.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Well, quite.
<br> 
<br>Aunt:  I will suffer comfort this once -- we shall just have to stick
<br>       forks in our legs between courses.  [sits]  I trust you remember
<br>       we eat no meat...?  [Uncle, off-camera, has sat too.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Heaven forbid, no!  [Goes to sit at the end of the table;
<br>	 Percy sits at the other end]  Here, we feast only on God's
<br>	 lovely turnip -- mashed.
<br> 
<br>Aunt:  [stands suddenly]  Mashed?!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Yes...
<br> 
<br>Aunt:  [slaps him twice]  Wicked child!!!  Mashing is also the work of
<br>       Beelzebub -- for Satan saw God's blessed turnip, and he envied it
<br>       and mashed it to spoil its sacred shape.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Ah.
<br> 
<br>Aunt:  I shall have my turnip as God intended.  [sits]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Fine.  [calls]  Baldrick!
<br> 
<br>	[Baldrick enters.]
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  My Lord...?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Will you fetch my dear aunt a raw turnip, please?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Well, we've only got the one that--
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [Interrupts, wanting to show authority in front of his servant
<br>         to Aunt and Uncle]  Just do it, thank you.
<br> 
<br>	[Baldrick leaves.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [to Uncle]  So, Uncle, will you have your turnip mashed, or as
<br>	 God intended?
<br> 
<br>Aunt:  He will not answer you; he has taken a vow of silence.
<br>       [Uncle looks quite unhappy]  I believe that silence is golden.
<br> 
<br>	[Edmund begins to say something like "Oh, I see" but decides it's
<br>	 better to be golden.  Aunt gives him an approving look.]
<br> 
<br>	[Pause]
<br> 
<br>	[Edmund, still not wanting to speak, but also wanting to get to the
<br>	 topic he wants to talk about, clears his thoat, making the word
<br>	 `inheritance' as he does so.]
<br> 
<br>	[There is a noisy knock on the front door.]
<br> 
<br>Aunt:  Edmund! I trust you have invited no other guests...?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Oh, certainly not!
<br> 
<br>Aunt:  Good -- for where there are other guests there are people to
<br>       fornicate with!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Well, quite.
<br> 
<br>	[More knocking on the front door.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  I'll just go and tell them to fornicate off.  [motions over to
<br>	 Percy]  Lord Percy...  [leaves]
<br> 
<br>Percy:  Erm, er, yes, er, well, Lord Whiteadder, er, a vow of silence...
<br>	Now, that's quite an interesting thing... Tell me about it.
<br> 
<br>	[In the hall, Edmund leaves his bedroom wearing a pair of false
<br>	 breasts over his clothing, then goes to the front door and opens
<br>	 it.  Monk, Partridge (holding an ostrich feather) and Piddle enter,
<br>	 also wearing false breasts over their clothing.  Monk wears a hat
<br>	 with a chicken on it; Partridge wears a hat with a model of a ship
<br>	 on it, and Piddle wears a hat with bells and something I can't
<br>	 describe -- like a May pole.  They sing.]
<br> 
<br>	"Happy Birthday to you!
<br>	 Happy Birthday to you!
<br>	 Happy Birthday, Eddy-baby!
<br>	 Happy Birthday to you!"
<br> 
<br>	[In the main room, Aunt can hear, and doesn't know what to make of it;
<br>	 Percy is unable to think of an explanation.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [loudly so Aunt can hear]  But it's not my birthday, Arch Deacon!
<br> 
<br>	[In the main room, Aunt nods and smiles.  Percy is relieved.]
<br> 
<br>	[Edmund leads the group into Baldrick's bedroom.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Well, well, get stuck in, boys.
<br> 
<br>Partridge:  `Stuck in'! Way-hey! Get it?
<br> 
<br>Monk:  No...  [Piddle doesn't, either]
<br> 
<br>Partridge:  Well, it sounds a bit rude, doesn't it!  `Stuck >inthat< noise -- it's the
<br>	 catholics next door, I'm afraid.
<br> 
<br>Aunt:  [stands angrily, makes a very disapproving noise]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Er, but, I'll, I'll just go and burn them.  Back in a minute.
<br>	 [stands]  Percy...  [leaves]
<br> 
<br>	[In the hall, Baldrick replaces Edmund's false breasts, and fits a
<br>	 false nose to Edmund's forehead, then dusts him off a bit.  As
<br>	 Edmund goes down the hall, he hears pounding from inside the closet.
<br>	 He opens the closet door.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Yes?
<br> 
<br>Queen:  I'm suffocating!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [still not knowing who it is]  Well, thank God you knocked.  [takes
<br>	 her out of the closet]  Come on, now, now, take a deep breath.
<br>	 [she does]  ...and another...  [she does]  Better?
<br> 
<br>Queen:  Yes.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Good.  [pushes her back into the closet, and closes the door again]
<br> 
<br>	[Back in the main room, Percy still tries to be good company.]
<br> 
<br>Percy:  Mind you, I'll say one thing for catholics: they do have
<br>	natural rhythm!  [Aunt leans toward him menacingly; he leans away]
<br> 
<br>	[In Baldrick's bedroom, Edmund has returned; they're all wearing
<br>	 false noses on their foreheads now, although Partridge's is coming
<br>	 out the side of his head.]
<br> 
<br>Melchett:  I notice you're not drinking, Blackadder...
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Oh, don't you worry about me, Melchers -- I'm holding my own here.
<br> 
<br>Partridge:  Way-hey! `Holding my own'!  Now, that sounds >incredibly< rude!
<br> 
<br>	[The boozers laugh.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Yes, well, I never went to university, of course.
<br> 
<br>Melchett:  [standing]  Er, Blackadder, it doesn't explain why you're not
<br>	   drinking with us.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Ah yes, no, that's what I actually came to talk to you about,
<br>	 you see.  What do you say about the idea of ten minutes absolute
<br>	 silence to get some really serious drinking in?
<br> 
<br>	[The boozers cheer, then realise that that's noisy, so they all go
<br>	 `shh!' rather messily.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Yes... I said, "Please give me silence" -- not "drench me with
<br>	 dribble."
<br> 
<br>Melchett:  [hands Edmund a silver goblet]  Well, now, here's a nice glass
<br>	   of cider.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Oh, only cider?  I'm going to go and put some brandy in it!
<br> 
<br>	[The boozers cheer and go `shh!' again, as Edmund leaves.]
<br> 
<br>	[Edmund enters the hallway, briefly opens the closet door and tosses
<br>	 the cider in.  Queen shrieks upon getting wet.  Edmund removes his
<br>	 false nose and breasts, heading for the main room.  In Baldrick's
<br>	 bedroom, meanwhile, the boozers and Melchett are sitting down
<br>	 like in a rowboat.  A barrel of something bursts open.  Edmund
<br>	 enters the main room once again.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  So, how are we all going, then?
<br> 
<br>Aunt:  Not well.  Let us discuss your inheritance.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [has sat]  Ah, yes, good.  Erm, a little drink, first?
<br> 
<br>Aunt:  [stands]  Drink?!  [slaps him twice]  Wicked child!!!  Drink is
<br>       urine for the last leper in Hell!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Oh, no, no -- this is only water.  This is a house of simple purity.
<br> 
<br>	[Monk enters, breasts and all, in convulsions.  He rushes to the
<br>	 fireplace and vomits, then turns and begins to leave.]
<br> 
<br>Monk:  Great booze-up, Edmund!  [farts, leaves]
<br> 
<br>	[pause]
<br> 
<br>Aunt:  Do you know that man?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [looks behind himself as though he didn't really see]  No...
<br> 
<br>Aunt:  He called you `Edmund'...
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Oh, >know< >himreal< drink!  [he gives a pitcher
<br>       to Edmund]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Well, fine...
<br> 
<br>Monk:  Bums up!
<br> 
<br>Partridge:  Way-hey! `Bums'!  Sounds a bit like `bum', doesn't it?
<br> 
<br>Melchett:  Drink, Blackadder!  Drink!
<br> 
<br>	[Edmund begins to drink...]
<br> 
<br>	[42 Seconds Later]
<br> 
<br>	[In the main room, Percy is hit by Aunt.  Edmund enters, with the
<br>	 cardinal hat on his head and the ostrich feather sticking out of
<br>	 the back of his tights.  His speech is slurred.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Percy, I've lost the bet.
<br> 
<br>Aunt:  Edmund! Explain yourself!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  I can't -- not just like that.  I'm a complicated person, you see,
<br>	 Aunty...  Sometimes I'm nice, and sometimes I'm nasty -- hee hee!
<br>	 ...and sometimes I just like to sing little songs, like:
<br>	 "See the little goblin, see his little--
<br> 
<br>Aunt:  I mean explain why you are wearing a cardinal's hat, why you are
<br>       grinning inanely, and [sees the feather as Edmund turns around and
<br>       falls to his knees, leaning against the chair to the side of the
<br>       door] ...why you have an ostrich feather sticking out of your
<br>       britches!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  I'm wearing a cardinal's hat because I'm Cardinal Chunder;
<br>	 I have an ostrich feather up my bottom [Percy nods and mouths
<br>	 Edmund's words, having heard this before] because Mr Ostrich put it
<br>	 there to keep in the little pixies -- hah hah! -- and I'm grinning
<br>	 inanely because I think I've just about succeeded in conning you
<br>	 and your daft husband out of a whopping great inheritance -- hee hee
<br>	 hee hee hee!
<br> 
<br>Aunt:  [shouting]  Is that right?  May I remind you, cursed creature [raises
<br>       her hand to slap him, but he's too far away, so slaps Percy instead],
<br>       that your inheritance depends upon your not drinking and not gambling.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Oh, yes -- damn.  Percy, the devil farts in my face once more.
<br> 
<br>Aunt:  Not mentioning farts was also a condition.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Shove off, you old trout!
<br> 
<br>Aunt:  How dare you speak to my husband like that!  [Uncle is surprised at
<br>       this remark]  Nathaniel, we're leaving!
<br> 
<br>	[Uncle stands and walks out.]
<br> 
<br>Aunt:  [turns to Percy]  and you...
<br> 
<br>Percy:  [frightened]  Yes?
<br> 
<br>Aunt:  Has anyone ever told you you're a giggling imbecile?
<br> 
<br>Percy:  [as though it goes without saying]  Oh, yes...
<br> 
<br>Aunt:  Good.  [stands, leaves, slamming the door]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Good riddance, you old witch!
<br> 
<br>	[There's a knock on the room door.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Whoops -- she's forgotten her broomstick.
<br> 
<br>	[The door opens, and Uncle leans in.]
<br> 
<br>Uncle:  Look, er... [checks to see that Aunt doesn't hear him]
<br>	I just wanted to say thanks for a splendid evening.  Yes, first rate,
<br>	all round... [looks toward Percy] ...particularly your jester.
<br> 
<br>	[Percy looks behind himself, confused, trying to find this jester.]
<br> 
<br>Uncle:  Oh, and, by the way, I loved the turnip -- very funny!
<br>	>Exactly< the same shape...as a thingy!  [leaves]
<br> 
<br>	[Aunt enters Baldrick's bedroom by accident.]
<br> 
<br>Aunt:  Good god!!!  [raises the large cross that she wears around her neck]
<br> 
<br>Partridge:  Well, look who it is!!!
<br> 
<br>Piddle:  Who is it?
<br> 
<br>Partridge:  Well, it's a boys' party; she's a girl, so she must be
<br>	    the stripper!
<br> 
<br>	[The boozers and Melchett cheer.  Aunt raises the cross even higher.]
<br> 
<br>	[Meanwhile, back in the main room...]
<br> 
<br>Percy:  Oh, no... Don't get too depressed, Edmund...  I mean, money
<br>	isn't everything...  Think of clouds and daisies and the lovely
<br>	smiles on little babies' faces... [he tries to make such a smile]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Be quiet, Percy...
<br> 
<br>	[In the hallway, Uncle opens the closet door, and motions to Aunt.]
<br> 
<br>Uncle:  This way!
<br> 
<br>	[Aunt and Uncle enter the closet; Queen comes out.  The boozers
<br>	 enter the hallway from Baldrick's bedroom.]
<br> 
<br>Partridge:  Whoa!  Another stripper!
<br> 
<br>	[Uncle comes out.]
<br> 
<br>Piddle:  ...and a male stripper!
<br> 
<br>	[The boozers cheer.  Uncle goes back into the closet.]
<br> 
<br>Monk:  [removing Queen's cloak]  Oh, yes, this is much more like it!
<br> 
<br>	[There's a pause while they see Queen in her royal dress]
<br> 
<br>Partridge:  ...and she's come dressed as the Queen!
<br> 
<br>Piddle:  Oh!! Sex-y!!! [does a little pelvic dance in front on Queen]
<br> 
<br>Queen:  Do you know who I am!
<br> 
<br>	[Edmund comes out from the main room.  Percy is behind him.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Yes! >I< know who you are!
<br> 
<br>[Piddle?]:  Who?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  You're Merlin, The Happy Pig!!!
<br> 
<br>	[The boozers cheer.]
<br> 
<br>Queen:  Wrong, I'm afraid.  I >am< the Queen of England.
<br> 
<br>	[Everyone slowly and clumsily (save Percy) falls to their knees.]
<br> 
<br>Queen:  I may have the body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the
<br>	heart and stomach of a concrete elephant!
<br> 
<br>Partridge:  Prove it!
<br> 
<br>Queen:  I certainly will...!  [she grabs a mug]  First I'm going to have
<br>	a little drinky, and then I'm going to execute the whole bally
<br>	lot of you.  [drinks]
<br> 
<br> 
<br>	[Dawn The Next Day]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [singing]  "See the little goblin, see his little feet /
<br>		     And his little nosy-wose -- isn't the goblin sweet?"
<br> 
<br>	[Everyone -- even Uncle, Percy and Baldrick are here -- shouts "Yes!"
<br>	 Some of them aren't wearing their own hats any more.  Percy has
<br>	 Uncle's helmet on, for instance.  Others have hats previously
<br>	 unseen.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  "See the little goblin--
<br> 
<br>Queen:  Er, wait a minute...  I'm sure there was something very important
<br>	I had to do to all of you this morning.  
<br> 
<br>	[Everyone -- including Queen -- giggles at the possibilities.]
<br> 
<br>Melchett:  I remember something about ten thousand florins...? was it...?
<br>	   or...?
<br> 
<br>Uncle:  I think it was something about an inheritance.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Look, do you lot want to hear about this goblin or not?
<br> 
<br>	[Everyone cheers "Yes!"]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Right! Well, perhaps this time I might be allowed to continue, 
<br>	 and perhaps finish, with any luck...
<br> 
<br>	[Suddenly, from under Queen's dress, Aunt emerges.]
<br> 
<br>Aunt:  `Luck'? Hah hah hah! Way-hey! Get it?
<br> 
<br>	[Everyone says, "No..."]
<br> 
<br>Aunt:  Oh, come on!  `Luck'!  Sounds almost exactly like `f--
<br> 
<br>	[Ending music and credits.  Edmund comes into view with a stick.
<br>	 He stabs and slashes into the bushes as he walks down the lane,
<br>	 hoping to hit the balladeer.  He goes far beyond the fountain.
<br>	 On the last line of the theme song, the balladeer is seen close
<br>	 to the camera view, then goes off-shot again.  Edmund sees him,
<br>	 and runs down the lane as fast as he can, stick raised in the air...]
