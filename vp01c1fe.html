The polls of from 930 to just over 1000 adults in each country were taken Feb. 13-21 and have margins of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. <br><br>The polls in Europe and the United States were part of Ipsos-Public Affairs quarterly Globus polls, supplemented by polls in Canada and Mexico. Interviews for the Mexico poll were done face-to-face and the surveys in the other countries were telephone polls. <br><br><br><br>BRITAIN:<br>* Two-thirds of Britons say they have a negative opinion of the role that President Bush plays in world affairs. <br><br>* The British are relatively worried about the threat of terrorism, with two-thirds, 66 percent, saying they're worried. Of that group, 21 percent say they're very worried. <br><br>* About two-thirds say the war in Iraq has increased the threat of terrorism in the world, and a similar number say the situation between Israel and the Palestinians has increased the threat of terrorism. <br><br>* About a third say if no weapons of mass destruction are found in Iraq, they would feel the United States and Britain should not have gone to war there. <br><br><br>CANADA:<br>* Two-thirds of Canadians say they have a negative opinion of the role that President Bush plays in world affairs. <br><br>* About four in 10 in Canada say they're worried about the threat of terrorism. <br><br>* Just over half say the war in Iraq increased the threat of terrorism and the same number say the situation between Israel and the Palestinians has made the threat of terror worse. <br><br>* People were closely divided on whether Britain and the United States should have gone to war in Iraq if no weapons of mass destruction are found or whether there were other reasons to justify going to war. <br><br><br>FRANCE:<br>* Just over eight in 10 of the French have a negative view of the role President plays in world affairs. <br><br>* Fewer than half, 44 percent, say they're worried about the threat of terrorism. <br><br>* Just over half said the war in Iraq has increased the threat of terrorism in the world, while six in 10 said the situation between Israel and the Palestinians has increased the terrorism threat. <br><br>* More than six in 10 of the French said that if no weapons of mass destruction are found in Iraq, there were other reasons for intervention. The French have said in numerous polls, however, that they were opposed to the war. <br><br><br>GERMANY:<br>* More than eight in 10 Germans, 85 percent, say they have a negative view of the role President Bush plays in world affairs. <br><br>* More than seven in 10, 72 percent, said they are worried about the threat of terrorism in their country. <br><br>* More than seven in 10 said the war in Iraq increased the threat of terrorism in the world, and a similar number said the situation between Israel and the Palestinians increased the terrorist threat. <br><br>* Two-thirds said that if weapons of mass destruction are not found in Iraq they will feel the United States and Britain should not have gone to war there. <br><br><br>ITALY:<br>* Almost six in 10 have a negative view of the role President Bush plays in world affairs. <br><br>* Seven in 10 said they're worried about the threat of terrorism in their country. <br><br>* Two-thirds said the war in Iraq has increased the threat of terrorism around the world, and the same number said the situation between Israel and the Palestinians has increased the terrorist threat. <br><br>* About three in 10 said that if weapons of mass destruction aren't found in Iraq, they will feel that the United States and Britain should not have gone to war there. <br><br><br>MEXICO:<br>* Half in Mexico have a negative view of the role President Bush plays in world affairs, while four in 10 have a positive view. <br><br>* People were closely divided on concern about terrorism, with half saying they were worried. <br><br>* About six in 10 said they thought the war in Iraq had increased the threat of terrorism, and almost that many said the situation between Israel and the Palestinians have made the terror threat worse. <br><br>* About a third said that if no weapons of mass destruction are found in Iraq, they will feel the United States and Britain should not have gone to war there. <br><br><br>SPAIN:<br>* Three-fourths say they have a negative view of the role that President Bush plays in world affairs. <br><br>* More than eight in 10, 85 percent, said they are worried about the threat of terrorism in their country. <br><br>* Two-thirds said the war in Iraq has increased the threat of terrorism in the world, and about the same number said the situation between Israel and the Palestinians has made the terror threat worse. <br><br>* People were divided about whether Britain and the United States were justified in going to war in Iraq if no weapons of mass destruction are found. <br><br><br>UNITED STATES:<br>* More than half, 57 percent, say they have a positive opinion of the role President Bush plays in world affairs. <br><br>* More than six in 10, 63 percent, said they are worried about the threat of terrorism in their country. <br><br>* People were evenly divided on whether the war in Iraq increased or decreased the threat of terrorism in the world. Six in 10 said the situation between Israel and the Palestinians increased the threat of terrorism. <br><br>* A third said that if weapons of mass destruction are not found in Iraq, they will feel the United States and Britain should not have gone to war there.<br> <br><br><br>
