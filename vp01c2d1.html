<br>
<br>B:  Baldrick
<br>E:  Edmund Blackadder
<br>PR: Prince Regent George
<br>K:  Keanrick, an actor
<br>M:  Mossop, another actor
<br>A:  An Anarchist
<br>MM: Mrs. Miggins
<br>
<br>
<br>The Palace Kitchens
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>(Blackadder walks in. Baldrick looks up from polishing a shoe.)
<br>
<br>B:  You look smart, Mr. Blackadder. Going somewhere nice?
<br>
<br>E:  No, I'm off to the theatre.
<br>
<br>B:  Don't you like it then?
<br>
<br>E:  (sarcastically) No, I don't! A load of stupid actors strutting around,
<br>    shouting, with their chests thrust out so far, you'd think their
<br>    nipples were attached to a pair of charging elephants! And the *worst*
<br>    thing about it is having to go with Prince *Mini-Brain*!
<br>
<br>B:  What, doesn't he like it, either?
<br>
<br>E:  No, no, he loves it. The problem is that he doesn't realise it's *made
<br>    up*. Last year, when Brutus was about to kill Julius Caesar, the
<br>    Prince yelled out, "Look behind you, Mr. Caesar!".
<br>
<br>B:  I don't see a point in the theatre. All that sex and violence. I get
<br>    enough of that at home. Except for the sex, of course.
<br>
<br>E:  While we're out, Baldrick, I want you to give this palace a good
<br>    *clean*. It's so dirty, it'll be unacceptable to a dung-beetle that
<br>    had lost interest in its career and really let itself go.
<br>
<br>(The Prince calls out.)
<br>
<br>PR: Come on, Blackadder, or we'll miss the first act!
<br>
<br>E:  (in a loud voice) Coming, sir, as fast as I can... Stick the kettle
<br>    on, Baldrick.
<br>
<br>
<br>The Theatre
<br>-----------
<br>
<br>(Actors Keanrick and Mossop are performing.)
<br>
<br>K:  Now Sir, give I this advice to thee: Never never trust thine enemy.
<br>
<br>(Keanrick fake-stabs Mossop under the armpit; Mossop dies dramatically.
<br>The Prince watches raptly; Blackadder completely disinterestedly.)
<br>
<br>K:  Thy life is forfeit... (kicks Mossop, who is still dying noisily) Thy
<br>    life is forfeit, sir, and at an end, like our poor play. We hope it
<br>    pleased you, friends.
<br>
<br>(Applause, except from the Prince's box.)
<br>
<br>PR: Certainly not, you murdering rotter! Guards, arrest that man!
<br>
<br>E:  Your Highness, it's only a play.
<br>
<br>PR: Oh, well, that's all very well, but that about the poor fellow who's
<br>    *dead*? Saying it's only a play will not feed and clothe the little
<br>    ones he leaves behind! (shouts) Call the militia!
<br>
<br>E:  But sir, he's not dead. See, he stands, awaiting your applause.
<br>
<br>PR: Oh, I say, that's very clever. He really isn't dead. (shouts and
<br>    applauds) Oh Bravo! Bravo!
<br>
<br>K:  (mutters to Mossop) Blast, the Prince likes it!
<br>
<br>M:  Oh shit, we'll close tonight.
<br>
<br>A:  Right, everybody out! Smash the Spinning Jenny! Burn the
<br>    rolling Rosalind! Destroy the going-up-and-down-a-bit-and-then-moving-
<br>    along Gertrude! And death to the stupid Prince who grows fat on the
<br>    profits!
<br>
<br>(He tosses a lighted bomb to the Prince. The audience scream and run for
<br>cover, except the Prince.)
<br>
<br>PR: I say, how exciting! This play's getting better and better! Bravo!
<br>    Bravo!
<br>
<br>E:  (voice from behind Prince) It's not a play anymore, sir. Put the bomb
<br>    down and make your way quietly to the exit.
<br>
<br>PR: Blackadder, you old thing, your problem is you can't tell when
<br>    something's real and when it's not! (the bomb blows up)
<br>
<br>
<br>The Prince's Lounge
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>(The Prince's head is wrapped up in bandages, with some band-aids on his
<br>face.)
<br>
<br>PR: I must say, Blackadder, that was a close shave! Why on earth would an
<br>    anarchist possibly want to kill *you*?
<br>
<br>E:  I think it might've been *you* he was after, sir.
<br>
<br>PR: Oh hogwash! What on earth makes you say that?
<br>
<br>E:  Well, my suspicions were first aroused by his use of the words, "Death
<br>    to the stupid Prince!"
<br>
<br>PR: It was a bit rude, wasn't it?
<br>
<br>E:  These are volatile times, your Highness. The American Revolution lost
<br>    your father the Colonies, the French Revolution murdered brave King
<br>    Louis and there are tremendous rumblings in Prussia, although that
<br>    might have something to do with the sausages. The whole world cries
<br>    out, "Peace, Freedom, and a few less fat bastards eating all the pie."
<br>
<br>PR: Well, yes, quite, something must be done! Any ideas?
<br>
<br>E:  Yes sir. Next week is your royal father's birthday celebrations. I
<br>    suggest that I write a brilliant speech for you to recite to show the
<br>    oppressed masses how unusually sensitive you are.
<br>
<br>(Blackadder holds a vial of smelling-salts under the Prince's nose.)
<br>
<br>G:  PPHHHGGTTT! Well, tell me about these "oppressed masses", what are
<br>    they so worked up about?
<br>
<br>E:  They're worked up, sir, because they're so poor, they're forced to
<br>    have children simply to provide a cheap alternative to turkey at
<br>    Christmas. Disease and depravation stalk our land like.. two giant..
<br>    stalking things. And the working man is poised to overthrow us.
<br>
<br>(Baldrick enters carrying a mop.)
<br>
<br>PR: Oh my God, and here he is!
<br>
<br>E:  Don't be silly, sir. That's Baldrick, my dogsbody.
<br>
<br>G:  What's silly about that? He looks like an oppressed mass to me. Get
<br>    him out of here at once!
<br>
<br>E:  Shoo, Baldrick, carry on with your cleaning elsewhere. And by the end
<br>    of tonight, I want that dining table so clean I can eat my dinner off
<br>    it.
<br>
<br>(Baldrick leaves.)
<br>
<br>PR: Cripes, Blackadder, I'm dicing with death here. The sooner I can show
<br>    how unusually sensitive I am, the better. (burps) Oh, I just had
<br>    another brilliant thought.
<br>
<br>E:  (sceptically) Another one, Your Highness?
<br>
<br>PR: Yes, another one, actually! You remember that one I, I had about, uh,
<br>    wearing underwear on the outside to save on laundry bills? Well, what
<br>    I'm thinking to myself is, "Hello, why don't we ask those two actor
<br>    chappies we saw tonight to teach me how to recite your speech?"
<br>    Brilliant, eh?
<br>
<br>E:  No, Your Highness, feeble.
<br>
<br>PR: What?
<br>
<br>E:  I would advise against it. It's a *feeble* idea.
<br>
<br>PR: Well, tish-and-pish to your advice, Blackadder! Get them here at once!
<br>    Damn it, I'd fed up with you treating me as if I'm sort of like some
<br>    kind of a thickie! It's not me that's thick, it's you and you know
<br>    why? Because I'm a bloody Prince and you're only a *butler*. And now
<br>    go and get those actors here this minute, Mr. Thicky-Black-Thicky-
<br>    Adder-Thicky.
<br>
<br>
<br>Mrs. Miggins' Coffee-Shop
<br>-------------------------
<br>
<br>E:  Mrs. Miggins, I'm looking for a couple of actors.
<br>
<br>MM: Well, you've come to the right place, Mr. B. There's more
<br>    Shakespearian dialogue in here than there are buns! (laughs) All my
<br>    lovely actors pop in on their way to rehearsals for a little cup of
<br>    coffee and a big dollop of inspiration.
<br>
<br>E:  You mean they actually rehearse? I thought they just got drunk, stuck
<br>    on a silly hat and trusted to luck.
<br>
<br>MM: Ohhh no. There's ever so much hard work that goes into the wonderful
<br>    magic that is theatre today. Haa-haa... still I don't expect you'd
<br>    know much about that, being only a little butler. (laughs and pinches
<br>    Blackadder's cheek)
<br>
<br>E:  They do say, Mrs. M, that verbal insults hurt *more* than physical
<br>    pain. (holds up a three-pronged fork) They are, of course, *wrong*, as
<br>    you'll soon discover when I stick this toasting fork in your head.
<br>
<br>(Actors Keanrick and Mossop enter.)
<br>
<br>M:  (from outside) Ladies and gentlemen, will you please welcome Mr. David
<br>    Keanrick.
<br>
<br>MM: (squeals as usual) Oh hurrah!
<br>
<br>(Keanrick enters, followed by Mossop.)
<br>
<br>M:  And the fabulous Mr. Enoch Mossop.
<br>
<br>MM: (applauds, continues to swoon) Gentlemen, gentlemen!
<br>
<br>K:  Settle down, settle down, settle down.
<br>
<br>M:  I'm sorry, no autographs.
<br>
<br>K:  The usual, Mrs. M.
<br>
<br>MM: OOoooohh, coming up, my lovely.
<br>
<br>E:  (noticing there's no one surrounding the actors) Ahh, if I can just
<br>    squeeze through this admiring rabble... (mimes wading through a crowd)
<br>    Gentlemen, I've come with a proposition.
<br>
<br>M:  How dare you, sir. You think, just because we're actors, we sleep with
<br>    *everyone*!
<br>
<br>E:  I think, being actors, you're lucky to sleep with *anyone*. I come
<br>    here on behalf of my employer, to ask for some elocution lessons.
<br>
<br>K:  Haa-ha, I fear, that is quite impossible. We are in the middle of
<br>    rehearsing for our new play. We cannot possibly betray our beloved
<br>    audience by taking time off.
<br>
<br>M:  Oh no, mustn't upset the punters. Bums on seats, laddie, bums on seats.
<br>
<br>E:  And what play is this?
<br>
<br>M:  It is a piece we penned ourselves, called "The Bloody Murder of the
<br>    Foul Prince Romero and His Enormous-Bosomed Wife".
<br>
<br>E:  A philosophical work then.
<br>
<br>K:  Indeed yes, sir. The violence of the murder and the vastness of the
<br>    bosom are entirely justified artistically.
<br>
<br>E:  Right, I'll tell the Prince that you can't make it.
<br>
<br>K:  Prince?
<br>
<br>E:  Sorry, yes. Didn't I mention that? It's the Prince Regent. Sorry you
<br>    can't make it. So...
<br>
<br>M:  No, no, no, no please, no. Please wait, sir. (to Keanrick, who is
<br>    clutching at him) Off, off! I think we can find some time, do you not,
<br>    Mr. Keanrick?
<br>
<br>K:  Definitely, Mr. Mossop.
<br>
<br>E:  No, no, you've got your beloved audience to think about.
<br>
<br>K:  Sod the proles! We'll come.
<br>
<br>M:  Yes, worthless bastards to a man.
<br>
<br>E:  It's nice to see artistic integrity thriving so strongly in the
<br>    theatre. Well, this afternoon at four then, at the Palace. (exits)
<br>
<br>
<br>The Prince's Lounge
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>(The Prince is wearing a long cape and a false moustache.)
<br>
<br>PR: Well, what do you think?
<br>
<br>E:  Are you ill or something?
<br>
<br>PR: No, I'm simply trying to look more like an actor.
<br>
<br>E:  Well, I'm sure you don't need the false moustache.
<br>
<br>PR: No?
<br>
<br>E:  No. (tears off the Prince's moustache)
<br>
<br>PR: Oowwwwh! (bumps into a cabinet; Baldrick emerges clutching a
<br>    feather-duster) Egads, it's that oppressed mass again! (starts to
<br>    strangle Baldrick)
<br>
<br>E:  No sir, that is Baldrick spring cleaning.
<br>
<br>PR: Oh yes, so it is.
<br>
<br>E:  Ummpf, finish the job later, Baldrick.
<br>
<br>B:  Very well sir. The cleaning or the being strangled?
<br>
<br>E:  Either suits me.
<br>
<br>PR: Look Blackadder, this is all getting a bit hairy, isn't it? I mean,
<br>    are you sure we can even trust these acting fellows? Last time we went
<br>    to the theatre, three of them *murdered* Julius Caesar, and one of
<br>    them was his best friend, Brutus.
<br>
<br>E:  As I've told you about *eight* times, the man playing Julius Caesar
<br>    was *an actor* called Kemp.
<br>
<br>PR: Really?
<br>
<br>E:  (sharply) Yes!
<br>
<br>PR: Thundering gherkins! Well, Brutus must have been pretty miffed when he
<br>    found out.
<br>
<br>E:  (very sharply) What?
<br>
<br>PR: That he hadn't killed Caesar after all, just some poxy actor called
<br>    Kemp. What, d'you think he went round to Caesar's place after the play
<br>    and killed him then?
<br>
<br>E:  Oh, God, it's pathetic!
<br>
<br>
<br>The Kitchens
<br>------------
<br>
<br>(There is a rapping at the door. Blackadder walks down the stairs.
<br>Baldrick looks up from his silver-polishing.)
<br>
<br>B:  Is that the door?
<br>
<br>E:  Oh, don't worry, it's just the actors.
<br>
<br>(Continued rapping. Blackadder pours himself a cup of tea.)
<br>
<br>B:  My uncle Baldrick was in a play once.
<br>
<br>E:  Really?
<br>
<br>B:  Yeah, it was called *Macbeth*.
<br>
<br>E:  And what did he play?
<br>
<br>B:  Second codpiece... Macbeth wore him in the fight scenes.
<br>
<br>E:  So he was a stunt codpiece. (sips his tea) Did he have a large part?
<br>
<br>B:  Depends who's playing Macbeth.
<br>
<br>E:  Oh, incidentally, Baldrick - actors are very superstitious. On no
<br>    account mention the word *Macbeth* this evening, alright?
<br>
<br>B:  Why not?
<br>
<br>E:  It brings them bad luck and it makes them very unhappy.
<br>
<br>B:  Oh, so you won't be mentioning it either?
<br>
<br>E:  No... well, not very often.
<br>
<br>
<br>The Prince's Lounge
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>E:  You should have knocked.
<br>
<br>K:  Our knocks, impertinent butler, were loud enough to wake the hounds of
<br>    hell!
<br>
<br>(The actors give Blackadder their hats.)
<br>
<br>K:  (to Mossop) Lead on, McDuff.
<br>
<br>M:  I shall...
<br>
<br>(They enter. Blackadder dumps their hats on the floor and kicks them into
<br>the hall.)
<br>
<br>M:  ..lest you continue in your quotations and mention the name of the
<br>    "Scottish Play".
<br>
<br>K:   Oh-ho... never fear, I shan't do that. (laughs)
<br>
<br>E:  By the "Scottish Play", I assume you mean *Macbeth*.
<br>
<br>(The actors perform a ritual warding off of bad luck.)
<br>
<br>As:  Aahhhhh! (slapping each others hands, pat-a-cake fashion) Hot potato,
<br>     off his drawers, pluck to make amends. (pinch each others noses)
<br>     Aaahh!
<br>
<br>E:  What was that?
<br>
<br>K:  We were exorcising evil spirits. Being but a mere butler, you will not
<br>    know the great theatre tradition that one does *never* speak the name
<br>    of the "Scottish Play".
<br>
<br>E:  What, *Macbeth*?
<br>
<br>As: Aahhhhh! Hot potato, off his drawers, pluck to make amends. Ohhh!
<br>
<br>E:  Good lord, you mean you have to do *that* every time I say *Macbeth*?
<br>
<br>As: Aahhhhh! Hot potato, off his drawers, pluck to make amends. Owwww!
<br>
<br>M:  Will you please stop saying *that*! Always call it the "Scottish
<br>    Play".
<br>
<br>E:  So you want me to say the "Scottish Play"?
<br>
<br>As: YES!!!
<br>
<br>E:  Rather than *Macbeth*?
<br>
<br>As: Aahhhhh! Hot potato, off his drawers, pluck to make amends. Owwwwww!
<br>
<br>(Prince George enters.)
<br>
<br>PR: For heaven's sake, what is all this hullabaloo, all this shouting and
<br>    screaming and yelling blue murder? Why... it's like that play we saw
<br>    the other day, what was it called... umm..
<br>
<br>E:  *Macbeth*, sir?
<br>
<br>As: Aahhhhh! Hot potato, off his drawers, pluck to make amends. Owwwwww!
<br>
<br>PR: No, no, it was called Julius Caesar.
<br>
<br>E:  Ah yes, of course. Julius Caesar... not *Macbeth*.
<br>
<br>As: Aahhhhh! Hot potato, off his drawers, pluck to make amends. Owwwwww!
<br>
<br>E:  Are you sure you want these people to stay?
<br>
<br>PR: Course, I asked them, didn't I, Mr. Thicky-Butler.
<br>
<br>K:  Your Highness, may I say what a great honour it is to be invited?
<br>
<br>PR: Why certainly.
<br>
<br>K:  Thank you. (dramatically) What a great honour that it is to be invited
<br>    here to make merry in the halls of our King's loins' most glorious
<br>    outpouring.
<br>
<br>PR: Eeergh!
<br>
<br>K:  Now, Your Highness, shall we begin straight away?
<br>
<br>PR: Absolutely, yes. Now, I've got this... um...
<br>
<br>M:  Now, before we inspect the script, let us have a look at stance.
<br>
<br>PR: Right.
<br>
<br>K:  Yes. The ordinary fellow stands like well... as you do now.
<br>
<br>M:  Whereas your hero... stands thus.
<br>
<br>(The actors assume a heroic stance - legs spread wide, hips thrust
<br>forwards. The Prince follows suit.)
<br>
<br>PR: Right. Well, that's sort of like this...
<br>
<br>K:  Excellent, Your Highness. Even more so...
<br>
<br>PR: What, oh, like that? (Even wider, standing as if on a ledge. A creak
<br>    sounds.) What was that noise?
<br>
<br>M:  It wasn't *me*! We are used to standing in this position.
<br>
<br>(Another creak.)
<br>
<br>PR: It came from over here. (opens a trunk to find Baldrick) Anarchist!
<br>
<br>B:  Cleaner!
<br>
<br>PR: So you've had a wash, that's no excuse! (starts strangling Baldrick
<br>    again)
<br>
<br>E:  (Enters, amidst the screams) No sir, that is Baldrick spring cleaning.
<br>
<br>PR: But he's, look, he's got a bomb!
<br>
<br>E:  That's not a *bomb*, sir, that's a sponge.
<br>
<br>PR: Oh yes, so it is. Well, get it out of here at once before it explodes.
<br>
<br>(Exit Baldrick, carrying the sponge very gingerly at arm's length.)
<br>
<br>PR: (continuing) Um, now, stance. I'm sorry about that. I think we really
<br>    had something there, too.
<br>
<br>K:  Oh yes, Your Highness. Why, your very posture tells me, "Here is a man
<br>    of true greatness."
<br>
<br>E:  Either that or "Here are my genitals, please kick them."
<br>
<br>M:  Sir, I really must ask that this ill-educated oaf be removed from the
<br>    room.
<br>
<br>K:  Yes! Get out sir. Your presence here is as useful as fine bone china
<br>    at a tea-party for drunken elephants.
<br>
<br>PR: Is that right? Well, yes, hang it all, get out Blackadder, and stop
<br>    corking our juices.
<br>
<br>E:  Certainly, Your Highness. I'll leave you to dribble in private.
<br>
<br>
<br>The Kitchens
<br>------------
<br>
<br>(Blackadder enters, fuming, and kicks a bucket down the stairs.)
<br>
<br>B:  Is something wrong, Mr. B.?
<br>
<br>E:  (angrily) I just about had it up to here with at that Prince. One more
<br>    insult, and I'll be handing in my notice.
<br>
<br>B:  Oh, does that mean I'll be butler?
<br>
<br>E:  Not unless some kindly passing surgeon cut your head open with a spade
<br>    and sticks a new brain in it.
<br>
<br>B:  Oh, right.
<br>
<br>E:  I don't know *why* I put up with it. I really don't. Every year at the
<br>    Guild of Butlers' Christmas Party, I'm the one who has to wear the red
<br>    nose and the pointy hat for winning the "Who's-Got-The-Stupidest-
<br>    Master" Competition. Well, all I can say is, he'd better watch out!
<br>    One more foot wrong and the contract between us will be as broken as
<br>    this milk-jug.
<br>
<br>B:  But that milk-jug isn't broken.
<br>
<br>E:  You really do walk into these things, don't you. (Smashes the milk-jug
<br>    on Baldrick's head.)
<br>
<br>
<br>The Prince's Lounge
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>(The Prince is practicing his heroic stance and face.)
<br>
<br>M:  Excellent. And now, sir, at last, the speech.
<br>
<br>PR: Right. (unfolds his speech and prepares to read it) Ahemm..
<br>
<br>K:  No, no, no, no... Your Royal Highness. What have you forgotten?
<br>
<br>PR: Oh now look, if I stand any more heroically than *this*, I'm in danger
<br>    of seriously disappointing my future Queen.
<br>
<br>K:  No, no, Your Highness, not the stance... the *roar*.
<br>
<br>PR: You want me to roar?
<br>
<br>M:  Well, of course we wish you to roar. All the great orators roar before
<br>    commencing with their speeches. It is the way of things. Ah, Mr.
<br>    Keanrick, from your Hamlet, please.
<br>
<br>K:  Hh-hmm... (orates) OOOOoooohhhhh... To be or not to be.
<br>
<br>M:  From your Julius Caesar.
<br>
<br>K:  OoooHHHHOOOOHHH... Friends, Romans, countrymen...
<br>
<br>(Blackadder enters, carrying a tray.)
<br>
<br>M:  From your leading character, in a play connected with Scotland.
<br>
<br>E:  That's *Macbeth*, isn't it?
<br>
<br>As: Aahhhhh! Hot potato, off his drawers, pluck to make amends. Owwwwww,
<br>    oh, oww..
<br>
<br>M:  (very nasally) Let's all roar together, shall we? One, two, three...
<br>
<br>(The actors and the Prince roar - the Prince's roar being louder and
<br>embarrassingly long.)
<br>
<br>K:  Excellent, Your Highness. Now shall we try putting it all together?
<br>
<br>PR: (adopts his heroic stance, screws up his face) RRROOOAAAAHHHHHHhhh...
<br>    (glances at his speech) Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking...
<br>
<br>K:  No, no, no, alas, I fear you mew it like a frightened tree. May I see
<br>    the speech? (the actors mutter together, laughing) Who wrote this
<br>    dribble?
<br>
<br>(All look at Edmund.)
<br>
<br>E:  Is there a problem with the speech?
<br>
<br>(The actors laugh.)
<br>
<br>PR: Well, yes, there is a problem, actually. The problem is that you wrote
<br>    it, Mr. Hopelessly-Drivelly-Can't-Write-For-Toffee-Crappy-Butler-Weed!
<br>
<br>(The actors laugh again. There is a long pause, then Blackadder drops his
<br>tray, obviously insulted.)
<br>
<br>E:  Whoops!
<br>
<br>
<br>The Kitchens
<br>------------
<br>
<br>B:  They want their supper, sir?
<br>
<br>E:  Yes, preferably something that has first passed through the digestive
<br>    system of the cat. And you'll have to take it up yourself.
<br>
<br>B:  Why?
<br>
<br>E:  Because I'm leaving, Baldrick. I'm about to enter the job market.
<br>    (reads the newspaper) Right, let's see... Situations vacant: Mr. and
<br>    Mrs. Pitt are looking for a baby-minder to take Pitt the Younger to
<br>    Parliament... there's a fellow called George Stevenson has invented a
<br>    moving kettle... wants someone to help with the marketing... oh, and
<br>    there's a foreign opportunity here. Treacherous, malicious,
<br>    unprincipled cad, preferably non-smoker, wanted to be King of
<br>    Sardinia. No time wasters please. By Napoleon Bonaparte, PO Box 1,
<br>    Paris. Right! We're on our way!
<br>
<br>
<br>The Prince's Dining Room
<br>------------------------
<br>
<br>M:  Oh, ah, sir... about costume. Any thoughts?
<br>
<br>PR: Well, enormous trousers, certainly. And I thought perhaps an Admiral's
<br>    uniform, because we know what all the nice girls love, don't we?
<br>
<br>(They all laugh.)
<br>
<br>PR: I'll tell you what, why don't I go and try them on for you?
<br>
<br>M:  Oh, super.
<br>
<br>G:  Help yourselves to  wine. You'll need a stiff drink when you see the
<br>    size of these damn trousers!
<br>
<br>(The actors laugh again. The Prince leaves; the laughter dies abruptly.)
<br>
<br>K:  Oh, my dear, what a ghastly evening!
<br>
<br>M:  You're so right, love.
<br>
<br>K:  Look, while he's gone, why don't we have a quick read-through of "The
<br>    Murder of Prince Romero and His Enormous-Bosomed Wife"?
<br>
<br>M:  Act 1, Scene 1?
<br>
<br>K:  Hmmm.
<br>
<br>M:  Spring has come, with all its gentle showers. Methinks it's time to
<br>    hack the Prince to death.
<br>
<br>
<br>The Kitchens
<br>------------
<br>
<br>E:  Baldrick, I would like to say how much I will miss your honest and
<br>    friendly companionship.
<br>
<br>B:  Aaahh, thank you Mr. B.
<br>
<br>E:  But as we both know, it'll be an utter lie. I will therefore confine
<br>    myself to saying simply, "Sod off," and if I ever meet you again,
<br>    it'll be twenty billion years too soon.
<br>
<br>(Blackadder walks out of the room...)
<br>
<br>B:  Goodbye, you lazy big-nosed, rubber-faced bastard.
<br>
<br>(...but not out of earshot; he comes back in. Baldrick looks worried.)
<br>
<br>E:  I fear, Baldrick, that you will soon be eating those badly chosen
<br>    words. I wouldn't bet you a single groat that you can survive five
<br>    minutes here without me.
<br>
<br>B:  Oh come on, Mr. B., it's not as though we're gonna get murdered or
<br>    anything the minute you leave, is it?
<br>
<br>E:  Hope springs eternal, Baldrick.
<br>
<br>(Blackadder leaves; the bell rings.)
<br>
<br>B:  Coming!
<br>
<br>
<br>The Prince's Dining Room
<br>------------------------
<br>
<br>(The actors are still rehearsing their play. Baldrick opens the door and
<br>listens.)
<br>
<br>K:  Oooooaaahhh, let's kill the Prince. Who will strike first?
<br>
<br>M:  Let me, and let this dagger's point prick out his soft eyeball and sup
<br>    with glee upon its exquisite jelly.
<br>
<br>K:  Have you the stomach?
<br>
<br>M:  I have not killed him yet, sir, but when I do, I shall have the
<br>    stomach and the liver, too, and the floppily-doppolies in their horrid
<br>    glue.
<br>
<br>K:  If a servant shall hear us in our plotting?
<br>
<br>M:  Ah ha! Then shall we  have servant sausages for tea!
<br>
<br>K:  And servant rissoles shall our supper be!
<br>
<br>(Baldrick runs off in terror, in search of the Prince.)
<br>
<br>
<br>The Prince's Dressing-room
<br>--------------------------
<br>
<br>B:  (shouting) Murder! Murder! The Revolution's started!!
<br>
<br>PR: (wearing a huge pair of trousers) What?!
<br>
<br>B:  A plot, a plot to kill you!
<br>
<br>PR: Ah, so you've come clean at last, have you, you bloody little poor
<br>    person!
<br>
<br>B:  No, look, the actors downstairs, they're anarchists!
<br>
<br>PR: Anarchists!?
<br>
<br>B:  Yeah, I heard them plotting. They're gonna poke out your liver, turn
<br>    me into rissole, and suck on your exquisite floppily-doppolies!
<br>
<br>PR: Oh, what are we going to do?
<br>
<br>B:  Well, Mr. Blackadder says, "when the going gets tough, the tough hide
<br>    under the table".
<br>
<br>PR: Blackadder, of course! Where is he?
<br>
<br>B:  Oh, he's in Sardinia.
<br>
<br>PR: What? Why?
<br>
<br>B:  You were rude to him, so he left.
<br>
<br>PR: Oh no! What a mad, blundering, incredibly handsome nincompoop I've
<br>    been! What are we to do? If we go downstairs, they'll chop us up and
<br>    eat us alive! We're doomed, doomed!
<br>
<br>(Baldrick whines. Suspense music strikes up...)
<br>
<br>PR: SHhh! Oh...
<br>
<br>(Baldrick whimpers. We hear footsteps, getting closer. Baldrick and
<br>George clutch each other. There is a creak, just before... Blackadder
<br>enters.)
<br>
<br>E:  Good evening, Your Highness.
<br>
<br>PR: Oh, Blackadder.
<br>
<br>E:  Four minutes, twenty-two seconds, Baldrick. You owe me a groat.
<br>
<br>PR: Thank God you're here! We desperately need you!
<br>
<br>E:  Who, me, sir? Mr. Thicky-Black-Thicky-Adder-Thicky?
<br>
<br>PR: Oh tish!
<br>
<br>E:  Mr. Hopelessly-Drivelly-Can't-Write-For-Toffee-Crappy-Butler-Weed?
<br>
<br>PR: Yes, I'm...
<br>
<br>E:  Mr. Brilliantly-Undervalued-Butler who hasn't had a raise in a
<br>    fortnight?
<br>
<br>PR: Take an extra thousand? Guineas? Per month?
<br>
<br>E:  All right. What's your problem?
<br>
<br>PR: Well look, the actors have turned out to be vicious anarchists! They
<br>    intend to kill us all!
<br>
<br>E:  What, are they going to *bore* us to death?
<br>
<br>PR: No, no, no, stab us! Baldrick overheard them.
<br>
<br>B:  I did!
<br>
<br>E:  Are you sure they meant it, sir?
<br>
<br>PR: Quite sure, Baldrick, how far apart were their legs?
<br>
<br>B:  Oh, this far. (spreads his legs)
<br>
<br>PR: And their nipples?
<br>
<br>B: That far. (indicates on his chest)
<br>
<br>E: Alright, sir, I'll see what I can do.
<br>
<br>
<br>The Prince's Dining Room
<br>------------------------
<br>
<br>M:  To torture him, I lust. Let's singe his hair, and up his nostrils hot
<br>    bananas thrust.
<br>
<br>E:  Rehearsal's going well, gentlemen?
<br>
<br>M:  Begone. A mere butler with the intellectual capacity of a squashed
<br>    apricot can be of no use to us.
<br>
<br>K:  Indeed yes, sir. Your participation is as irritating as a potted
<br>    cactus in a monkey's pajamas.
<br>
<br>E:  Well, in that case, I won't interrupt you any longer. Sorry to disturb
<br>    you.
<br>
<br>
<br>The Prince's Dressing-room
<br>--------------------------
<br>
<br>(Baldrick and the Prince are cowering under the table.)
<br>
<br>PR: Blackadder, thank God you're safe! Well, what happened?
<br>
<br>E:  Sir, there was no need to panic. It was all perfectly straightforward.
<br>
<br>PR: Well?
<br>
<br>E:  They're traitors, sir. They must be arrested, brutally tortured and
<br>    executed forthwith.
<br>
<br>PR: Bravo! (bangs his head under the table)
<br>
<br>
<br>The Prince's Lounge
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>(Later. The actors are tied up with two Guards holding them.)
<br>
<br>M:  But Your Highness, there's been a terrible mistake.
<br>
<br>E:  That's what they were bound to say, sir.
<br>
<br>K:  It was a play, sir, a play! Look, all the words you heard written down
<br>    on that page.
<br>
<br>E:  Textbook, stuff again, you see. The criminals' vanity always makes
<br>    them make one tiny, but fatal, mistake. Theirs was to have their
<br>    entire conspiracy printed and published in plain manuscript. (to
<br>    Guards) Take them away!
<br>
<br>As: Mercy, we beg for mercy... please sir.
<br>
<br>E:  I have got only one thing to say to you... *Macbeth*!
<br>
<br>As: Aahhhhh! Hot potato, off his drawers, pluck to make amends...
<br>
<br>(The actors are led out.)
<br>
<br>PR: Well done, Bladder! How can I ever thank you?
<br>
<br>E:  Well, you can start by not calling me "Bladder", sir. (calls out)
<br>    Macbeth!
<br>
<br>(Distant sounds of the actors' ritual drift in from outside...)
<br>
<br>PR: Of course, Bladder. No sooner said than done. No hard feelings?
<br>
<br>E:  No sir. It's good to be back in the saddle. Did I say saddle? I mean
<br>    harness.
<br>
<br>PR: Bravo! So we're the best of friends as ever we were.
<br>
<br>E:  Absolutely sir.
<br>
<br>PR: Hurrah!
<br>
<br>E:  In fact now with the evil Mossop and Keanrick have got their
<br>    comeuppance, the Drury Lane Theatre is free. I thought we might
<br>    celebrate by staging a little play that I've written.
<br>
<br>PR: Oh, what an excellent idea! And with my new found acting skills, um,
<br>    might there be a part in it for me, do you think?
<br>
<br>E:  I was hoping you might play the title role, sir.
<br>
<br>PR: What a roaringly good idea! What's the play called?
<br>
<br>E:  Thick Jack Clot Sits in the Stocks and Gets Pelted with Rancid
<br>    Tomatoes.
<br>
<br>PR: Excellent!
<br>
<br>
<br>                                 For the
