<br>Transcript: Bin Laden video excerpts
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Osama Bin Laden urges targeting US economy
<br>
<br>Qatar-based satellite television station al Jazeera has broadcast in full a 33-minute video recorded by Osama Bin Laden. Below is the transcript of the excerpts. 
<br>Three months after the blessed strikes against world atheism and its leader, America, and around two months after the fierce crusade against Islam, we must review the impact of these events. 
<br>
<br>The latest events have proved important truths. 
<br>
<br>It has become clear that the West in general and America in particular have an unspeakable hatred for Islam. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>" We have witnessed the true crimes of those who call themselves humanists and claim to be defenders of freedom " 
<br>
<br>
<br>Those who lived under continuous US raids for the past months are aware of it. 
<br>How many villages have been destroyed and how many millions have been pushed out in the freezing cold? 
<br>
<br>These men, women and children who have been damned and now live under tents in Pakistan, have committed no sin. 
<br>
<br>They are innocent. But on a mere suspicion, the United States has launched this fierce campaign. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>" Only seven grammes of explosives are needed to kill someone, but the United States has used bombs weighing seven million grammes " 
<br>
<br>
<br>We have witnessed the true crimes of those who call themselves humanists and claim to be defenders of freedom. 
<br>Only seven grammes of explosives are needed to kill someone, but the United States has used bombs weighing seven million grammes proving their hatred of the Taleban and Muslims. 
<br>
<br>When the youths - may God receive them as martyrs - blew up (the US embassy) in Nairobi, less than two tonnes were used. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>" Terrorism against America deserves to be praised because it was a response to injustice " 
<br>
<br>
<br>The United States then said it was a terrorist act and a mass destruction weapon, while they unscrupulously used two seven-tonne bombs, of seven million grammes each. 
<br>After they (the Americans), for no reason, bombed entire villages to scare the inhabitants, the defence secretary said it was the United States' right to exterminate the peoples since they are Muslim and since they are not American. 
<br>
<br>It is a blatant crime. 
<br>
<br>A few days ago, they bombed al-Qaeda positions in Khost (eastern Afghanistan) and dropped - in what they said was a mistake - a radio-guided bomb on a mosque where ulemas were praying. 
<br>
<br>They targeted the mosque, killing 150 Muslim worshippers. 
<br>
<br>It is the hatred of crusaders. 
<br>
<br>Terrorism against America deserves to be praised because it was a response to injustice, aimed at forcing America to stop its support for Israel, which kills our people. 
<br>
<br>
<br>We say that the end of the United States is imminent, whether Bin Laden or his followers are alive or dead, for the awakening of the Muslim umma (nation) has occurred. 
<br>
<br>It is important to hit the economy (of the United States), which is the base of its military power...If the economy is hit they will become reoccupied.
