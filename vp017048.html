UNCLASSIFIED   STATE   00151363 <br>VZCZCXRO2488<br>PP RUEHKW<br>DE RUEHC #1363 2281831<br>ZNR UUUUU ZZH<br>P 161828Z AUG 05<br>FM SECSTATE WASHDC<br>TO ALL DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR POSTS COLLECTIVE PRIORITY<br>RUEHDBU/AMEMBASSY DUSHANBE PRIORITY 1184<br>RUEHKH/AMEMBASSY KHARTOUM PRIORITY 0297<br>RUEHTRO/USLO TRIPOLI PRIORITY 3689<br>RUEHBE/AMEMBASSY BELIZE PRIORITY 2504<br>BT<br>UNCLAS STATE 151363<br><br>FOR AMBASSADORS AND PAOS FROM KAREN HUGHES<br><br>E.O. 12958: N/A<br>TAGS: KPAO<br>SUBJECT: THE ECHO CHAMBER:  GETTING THE WORD OUT<br><br>1.  I am delighted to begin my new job as Under Secretary<br>for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs and particularly<br>enthusiastic about working with all of you.  The President<br>and the Secretary believe that our joint mission of public<br>diplomacy is critical to advancing America's interests<br>around the world.  I view one of my most important roles<br>to be providing our ambassadors and public affairs<br>officers serving in our embassies tools to help you do<br>your jobs.<br><br>2.  This week, any representative of our government who is<br>giving speeches or media interviews or attending events<br>(and I hope all of you will be!) is likely to be asked<br>about the Iraqi Constitution and Israel's withdrawal from<br>Gaza.  Below are a few paragraphs outlining our<br>government's position on these critical issues.<br><br>3.  After only one day on the job, I have realized that<br>you are inundated with vast amounts of information.  My<br>hope is that my office can help you synthesize and provide<br>a quick and easily absorbed summary of information that<br>you can feel confident using on major issues.  This will<br>be updated periodically, as events warrant.  I welcome<br>your feedback and hope this is useful.<br><br>Iraqi Constitution<br>------------------<br><br>4.    Americans congratulate the people of Iraq for the<br>progress they are making on their new constitution; as the<br>drafters debate difficult issues they are providing an<br>example of democracy in action.<br><br>Iraqi leaders asked for and received the unanimous consent<br>of their assembly to continue their work for seven days -<br>importantly, the drafters did not give up, walk out or try<br>to go around the process.  The drafters decided they have<br>made substantial progress but need more time to put<br>together a document that will be the foundation of a free<br>and democratic Iraq for years to come.<br><br>The new Constitution will be the most important document<br>in the history of the new Iraq.  While difficult issues<br>remain, we are impressed with the progress that Iraqi<br>leaders are making.  The drafters of our American<br>Constitution worked on our founding document for months<br>before finally balancing regional concerns and building a<br>stable government structure.  We are confident that the<br>Iraqi people will complete this process and continue on<br>the path toward elections for a permanent government at<br>the end of this year.<br><br>Gaza Withdrawal<br>---------------<br><br>5.     Americans are hopeful that Israel's withdrawal from<br>Gaza will proceed peacefully, without outside agitation or<br>violence.  We understand that this is a difficult and<br>emotional moment for the Israeli citizens who must leave<br>their homes, but it is important to remember that the<br>decision to withdraw was made by Israel's leaders in the<br>interests of greater security for the state of Israel.<br><br>The withdrawal has the opportunity to be a significant<br>milestone in the road toward peace, as it is a tangible<br>step toward the shared vision of two states living side by<br>side in peace and security.  What is crucial is that the<br>Israelis and the Palestinians work together to make the<br>withdrawal a success that will help both sides move<br>forward and re-energize progress along the roadmap.<br><br>President Bush has stressed that all parties have<br>obligations in the context of the Gaza withdrawal: Israel<br>to ensure a peaceful withdrawal, the Palestinians to<br>maintain control over terrorist groups, and the Arab<br>states to provide political and financial support to the<br>Palestinians as they work to build the basis of a<br>peaceful, prosperous state in Gaza.<br>It is essential that the members of the international<br>community also mobilize to make this important development<br>a success.  The G-8 leaders noted at Gleneagles their<br>commitment to help secure up to $3 billion a year over<br>three years to support the recovery of the Palestinian<br>economy.<br>6.  Minimize considered.<br>RICE<br>BT<br>#1363<br><br>NNNN<br>UNCLASSIFIED   STATE   00151363 <br><br>
