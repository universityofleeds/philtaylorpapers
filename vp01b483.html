<br>
<br>
<br>E:  Edmund Blackadder
<br>B:  Baldrick
<br>PR: Prince Regent George
<br>A:  Miss Amy Hardwood
<br>H:  Mr. Hardwood
<br>SC: Sally Cheapside
<br>DC: The Duke of Cheapside
<br>S:  The Shadow
<br>MM: Mrs. Miggins
<br>
<br>
<br>The Palace Kitchens
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>(Baldrick is plucking a goose. Blackadder is sitting at the kitchen
<br>table.)
<br>
<br>E:  Oh God! Bills, bills, bills. One is born, one runs up bills, one dies!
<br>    And what have I got to show for it? Nothing. A butler's uniform and a
<br>    slightly effeminate hairdo! Honestly Baldrick, I sometimes feel like a
<br>    pelican - whichever way I turn, I've still got an enormous bill in
<br>    front of me. Pass the biscuit barrel. (Baldrick does so) Let's see
<br>    what's in the kitty shall we? (shakes out a few coins) Ninepence! Oh
<br>    God, what are we going to do?
<br>
<br>B:  Don't worry Mr B., I have a cunning plan to solve the problem.
<br>
<br>E:  Yes Baldrick, let us not forget that you tried to solve the problem
<br>    of your mother's low ceiling by cutting off her head.
<br>
<br>B:  But this is a really good one. You become a dashing highwayman, then
<br>    you can pay all your bills and, on top of that, everyone'll want to
<br>    sleep with you.
<br>
<br>E:  Baldrick, I could become a prostitute and pay my bills, then
<br>    everyone would want to sleep with me - but I do consider certain
<br>    professions  beneath me. But besides which, I fail to see why a common
<br>    thief should be idolised, just because he has a horse between his legs.
<br>
<br>B:  My favourite's the Shadow. (Admiringly) What a man! They say he's
<br>    half-way to being the new Robin Hood.
<br>
<br>E:  Why only half-way?
<br>
<br>B:  Well he steals from the rich, but he hasn't got round to giving it
<br>    to the poor yet. Look! I've got a poster of him.
<br>
<br>(Baldrick holds up a poster which reads "Wanted for Hanging, The Shadow.
<br>Reward...")
<br>
<br>E:  Baldrick, I have no desire to get hung for wearing a silly hat. If I
<br>    want to get rich quick, all I have to do is go upstairs and ask Prince
<br>    Fathead for a rise.
<br>
<br>(The Prince rings.)
<br>
<br>E:  Oop! The bank's open!
<br>
<br>
<br>The Prince's Lounge
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>E:  Good morning sir. May I say how *immensely* rich you're looking?
<br>    Now, was there anything you wanted? Anything at all? Absolutely
<br>    anything?
<br>
<br>PR: Well yes, old fellow, I was wondering if you could possibly lend me
<br>    a bit of cash.
<br>
<br>E:  But of course sir. I- cash?
<br>
<br>PR: Yes, I'm rotten stinking stoning stinking broke!
<br>
<br>E:  But sir, what about the five thousand pounds that Parliament voted
<br>    you only last week to drink yourself to death with?
<br>
<br>PR: All gone I'm afraid. You see, I've discovered this terrifically fun
<br>    new game. It's called "cards". What happens is, you sit round the
<br>    table with your friends, and you deal out five "cards" each, and then
<br>    the object of the game is to give away all your money as quickly as
<br>    possible. Do you know it?
<br>
<br>E:  Vaguely sir, yes.
<br>
<br>PR: All the chaps say I'm terrific at it.
<br>
<br>E:  I seem to remember I was very bad at it. I always seemed to end up
<br>    with more money than I started with.
<br>
<br>PR: Yes, well, it's all down to practice. I'm a natural apparently. The
<br>    only drawback, of course, is that it's pretty damned expensive. So,
<br>    basically, I was wondering if you could lend me a couple of hundred.
<br>
<br>E:  I'm afraid that's impossible sir. I'm as poor as a church mouse
<br>    that's just had an enormous tax bill on the very day his wife ran off
<br>    with another mouse, taking all the cheese.
<br>
<br>PR: Well what am I going to do?
<br>
<br>E:  Yes, it's a difficult one.
<br>
<br>PR: Hmm.
<br>
<br>E:  Let's see now. You can't borrow money, you're not going to inherit
<br>    any money and obviously you can't earn money. Sir, sir, drastic
<br>    situations call for drastic measures. If you can't make money, you'll
<br>    have to marry it.
<br>
<br>PR: Marry? Never! I'm a gay bachelor, Blackadder. I'm a roarer, a
<br>    rogerer, a gorger and a puker! I can't marry, I'm young, I'm firm
<br>    buttocked, I'm...
<br>
<br>E:  Broke?
<br>
<br>PR: Well, yes, I suppose so.
<br>
<br>E:  And don't forget, sir, that the modern Church smiles on roaring and
<br>    gorging within wedlock, and indeed rogering is keenly encouraged.
<br>
<br>PR: And the puking?
<br>
<br>E:  Mmm, I believe still very much down to the conscience of the
<br>    individual church-goer.
<br>
<br>PR: Well yes, tally-ho then Blackadder. Yes, you fix it up. You know
<br>    the kind of girls I like, they've got to be lovers, laughers, dancers...
<br>
<br>E:  And bonkers!
<br>
<br>PR: That goes without saying!
<br>
<br>
<br>The Kitchens
<br>------------
<br>
<br>(Blackadder is leafing through a book, while in the background Baldrick is
<br>pulling the giblets out of his bird.)
<br>
<br>E:  Oh God!
<br>
<br>B:  Something wrong, Mr B.?
<br>
<br>E:  I can't find a single person suitable to marry the prince.
<br>
<br>B:  Oh please keep trying. I love a royal wedding. The excitement, the
<br>    crowds, the souvenir mugs, the worrying about whether the bride's
<br>    lost weight.
<br>
<br>E:  Unlikely with this lot I'm afraid. If the prince had stipulated
<br>    "must weigh a quarter of a ton" we'd be laughing. Of the 262
<br>    princesses in Europe, 165 are over 80, they're out, 47 are under 10,
<br>    they're out, and 39 are mad.
<br>
<br>B:  Well they sound ideal.
<br>
<br>E:  Well they would be if they hadn't all got married last week in
<br>    Munich to the same horse. Which leaves us with two.
<br>
<br>B:  And what about them?
<br>
<br>E:  Well, there's  Grand Duchess Sophia of Turin. We'll never get her to
<br>    marry him.
<br>
<br>B:  Why not?
<br>
<br>E:  Because she's *met* him.
<br>
<br>B:  Which leaves?
<br>
<br>E:  Caroline of Brunswick as the only available princess in Europe.
<br>
<br>B:  And what's wrong with her?
<br>
<br>E:  "Get more coffee! It's horrid! Change it! Take me roughly from
<br>    behind! No, not like that, like this! Trousers off! Tackle out! Walk
<br>    the dog! Where's my presents?"
<br>
<br>B:  (flustered) All right! Which one do you want me to do first?
<br>
<br>E:  No, that's what Caroline's like. She is famous for having the worst
<br>    personality in Germany. And as you can imagine, that's up against some
<br>    pretty stiff competition.
<br>
<br>B:  So you're stuck then.
<br>
<br>E:  Yes, I'm afraid I am. Unless, oh unless! Pass me the paper Baldrick
<br>    quick. (he opens the paper) Baldrick, why has half the front page been
<br>    cut out?
<br>
<br>B:  I don't know.
<br>
<br>E:  You do know, don't you?
<br>
<br>B:  Yes.
<br>
<br>E:  You've been cutting out the cuttings about the elusive Shadow to put
<br>    in your highwayman's scrapbook haven't you?
<br>
<br>B:  Oh, I can't help it Mr B. His life is so dark and shadowy and full
<br>    of fear and trepidation.
<br>
<br>E:  So is going to the toilet in the middle of the night, but you don't
<br>    keep a scrapbook on it.
<br>
<br>B:  (surprised) I do.
<br>
<br>E:  Let's see. Now let's see, society pages. You see, it needn't
<br>    necessarily be a princess. All the Prince wants is someone pretty and
<br>    rich.
<br>
<br>B:  Oh dear, that rules me out then.
<br>
<br>E:  Now, let me see. "Beau Brummel in purple pants probe." "King talks
<br>    to tree. Phew what a loony!" God, the Times has really gone downhill
<br>    recently hasn't it! Aha. Listen to this, listen to this: "Mysterious
<br>    Northern beauty, Miss Amy Hardwood, comes to London and spends
<br>    flipping great wadges of cash!" That's our baby!
<br>
<br>
<br>The Prince's Bedroom
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>(Blackadder is brushing down the Prince's jacket.)
<br>
<br>PR: Honestly Blackadder, I don't know why I'm bothering to get dressed.
<br>    As soon as I get to the Naughty Hellfire Club I'll be debagged and
<br>    radished for non-payment of debts.
<br>
<br>E:  Radished, sir?
<br>
<br>PR: Yes, they pull your breeches down and push a large radish right up
<br>    your-
<br>
<br>E:  Yes, yes, yes, all right. There's no need to hammer it home.
<br>
<br>PR: Well as a matter of fact they do often have to-
<br>
<br>E:  No, no! No! Your em, your money worries are, are, are over sir.
<br>
<br>PR: Well hoorah for that!
<br>
<br>E:  I have found you a bride. Her name is Amy, daughter of the noted
<br>    industrialist, Mr Hardwood.
<br>
<br>PR: Oh dammit Blackadder, you know I loathe industrialists. Sad,
<br>    balding, little proles in their "damn your eyes" whiskers. All puffed
<br>    up just because they know where to put the legs on a a pair of
<br>    trousers.
<br>
<br>E:  Eh, believe me, these people are the future. This man probably owns
<br>    half of Lancashire. His family's got more mills than, than you've got
<br>    brain cells.
<br>
<br>PR: How many mills?
<br>
<br>E:  Seven sir.
<br>
<br>PR: Quite a lot of mills then.
<br>
<br>E:  Yes. He has patented a machine called "The Ravelling Nancy".
<br>
<br>PR: Mmm, what does it do?
<br>
<br>E:  It ravels cotton sir.
<br>
<br>PR: What for?
<br>
<br>E:  That I cannot say sir. I am one of these people who are quite happy
<br>    to wear cotton, but have no idea how it works. She is also a beauty,
<br>    sir.
<br>
<br>PR: Well if she's gonna be my bird, she'd better be! Right, so what's
<br>    the plan?
<br>
<br>E:  Well I thought I could take her a short note expressing your 
<br>    honourable intentions.
<br>
<br>PR: Yes, yes, I think so too. All right then, well take this down. Eh,
<br>    "From His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales to Miss Amy Hardwood.
<br>    Tally-ho my fine saucy young trollop! Your luck's in! Trip along here
<br>    with all your cash, and some naughty night attire, and you'll be
<br>    staring at my bedroom ceiling from now till Christmas, you lucky tart!
<br>    Yours with the deepest respect etc, signed George. PS Woof woof!"
<br>    Well, what do you think?
<br>
<br>E:  It's very *moving* sir. Would you mind if I change just one tiny
<br>    aspect of it?
<br>
<br>PR: Which one?
<br>
<br>E:  The words.
<br>
<br>PR: Oh yes, I'll, I'll, I'll leave the details to you Blackadder. Just
<br>    make  sure she knows I'm all man... with a bit of animal thrown in.
<br>    Rrrrgh!
<br>
<br>E:  Certainly sir. (Scores out the Prince's letter)
<br>
<br>
<br>The Home of Amy Hardwood
<br>------------------------
<br>
<br>E:  From his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales to Miss Amy Hardwood:-
<br>    "The upturned tilt of you tiny wee nosy, smells as sweet as a great
<br>    big posy." Fanciful stuff of course madam, but, but from the heart.
<br>
<br>A:  He says my nosy is tiny ?
<br>
<br>E:  And wee, madam.
<br>
<br>A:  Well he must be an awful clever clogs, because you see, my nosy is
<br>    tiny, and so wee, that I sometimes think the pixies gave it to me!
<br>
<br>E:  He continues. "Oh Lady Amy, queen of all your sex." I apologise for
<br>    the word, madam, but Prince George is a man of passion.
<br>
<br>A:  Oh, don't worry, I can get pretty cross myself sometimes. Tell me
<br>    Mr. Blackadder, I've heard a teensy rumour that the Prince has the
<br>    manners of a boy cow's dingle dangle. What do you have to say to that?
<br>
<br>E:  Oh, that is a lie madam. Prince George is shy and just pretends to
<br>    be bluff and crass and unbelievably thick and gittish, whilst deep
<br>    down he is a soft little marshmallowy, pigletty type of creature.
<br>
<br>A:  Oh I'm so glad, because you see, I'm a delicate tiny thing myself,
<br>    weak and silly and like a little fluffy rabbit. So I could never marry
<br>    a horrible heffalump, or I might get squished. Tell me, when can I
<br>    meet the lovely Prince?
<br>
<br>E:  (surprised) You want to meet him?
<br>
<br>A:  Well if we're going to get married I think I probably ought to. I
<br>    know! Tell him to come and serenade me tonight. I'll be on my balcony
<br>    in my jim-jams.
<br>
<br>E:  Certainly madam.
<br>
<br>(Mr Hardwood enters.)
<br>
<br>H:  Ay up! Who's this big girl's blouse then ?
<br>
<br>A:  Father, this is Mr. Blackadder, he's come a-wooing from the Prince.
<br>
<br>E:  You have a beautiful and charming daughter, sir.
<br>
<br>H:  Indeed I do. I love her more than any pig, and that's saying summat!
<br>
<br>E:  It certainly is.
<br>
<br>H:  And let me tell you, I'd no more place her in the hands of an
<br>    unworthy man than I'd place my John Thomas in the hands of a lunatic
<br>    with a pair of scissors.
<br>
<br>E:  An attitude that does you credit sir.
<br>
<br>H:  I'd rather take off all my clothes and paint my bottom blue than
<br>    give her to a man who didn't love her!
<br>
<br>E:  What self-respecting father could do more ?
<br>
<br>H:  On the other hand, if he's a prince, he can have her for ten bob and
<br>    a pickled egg.
<br>
<br>E:  I can see where your daughter gets her ready wit, sir.
<br>
<br>H:  I thank you.
<br>
<br>E:  Although where she gets her good looks and charm is perhaps more of
<br>    a mystery.
<br>
<br>H:  No one ever made money out of good looks and charm.
<br>
<br>E:  You obviously haven't met Lady Hamilton, sir. (bows slightly and
<br>    leaves)
<br>
<br>
<br>The Kitchens
<br>------------
<br>
<br>(Baldrick is forcing stuffing into his goose.)
<br>
<br>E:  I tell you Baldrick, I'm not looking forward to this evening. Trying
<br>    to serenade a light fluffy bunny of a girl in the company of an
<br>    arrogant half German yob with a mad dad.
<br>
<br>B:  Well, he is the Prince of Wales.
<br>
<br>E:  Have you ever been to Wales, Baldrick?
<br>
<br>B:  No, but I've often thought I'd like to.
<br>
<br>E:  Well don't, it's a ghastly place. Huge gangs of tough sinewy men
<br>    roam the valleys terrifying people with their close harmony singing.
<br>    You need half a pint of phlegm in your throat just to pronounce the
<br>    placenames. Never ask for directions in Wales Baldrick, you'll be
<br>    washing spit out of your hair for a fortnight.
<br>
<br>B:  So, eh, being Prince of it isn't considered a plus? (hammers a large
<br>    orange into the goose)
<br>
<br>E:  I fear not, no. But the crucial thing is that they must never be
<br>    left alone together before the marriage.
<br>
<br>B:  But isn't that a bit unfair on her?
<br>
<br>E:  Well it's not exactly fair on him either. The girl is wetter than a
<br>    haddock's bathing costume. But you know Baldrick, the world isn't
<br>    fair. If it was, things like this wouldn't happen would they? (hits
<br>    Baldrick around the back of the head)
<br>
<br>
<br>Under Amy's Balcony
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>
<br>(The Prince and Blackadder are hiding behind some bushes. They speak in
<br>whispers.)
<br>
<br>PR: All right, so what's the plan? Shin up the drain and ask her if
<br>    she'll take delivery of your consignment of German sausage?
<br>
<br>E:  No sir, as we rehearsed, poetry first, sausage later.
<br>
<br>PR: Right. So what do you think? "Harold the Horny Hunter" should do
<br>    the trick.
<br>
<br>E:  Just remind me of it, sir?
<br>
<br>PR: (loudly) "Harold the Horny hunter, had an enormous horn..."
<br>
<br>E:  Shh yes yes. It is absolutely excellent sir, however, might I
<br>    suggest an alternative? (hands the Prince a poem)
<br>
<br>PR: "Lovely little dumpling, how in love I am. Let me be your
<br>    shepardkins, you can be my lamb." Well, I think we'll be very lucky if
<br>    she doesn't just come out onto the balcony and vomit over us, but
<br>    still, let's give it a whirl.
<br>
<br>E:  Just stand right here sir. Right. Call for her romantically.
<br>
<br>PR: Right. (shouts) Oy! Come on out here, you rollicking trolloping
<br>    sauce bottle!
<br>
<br>A:  George?
<br>
<br>PR: Woof woof!
<br>
<br>(Amy appears on the balcony. Blackadder grabs the Prince, covering his mouth.)
<br>
<br>A:  Is that you?
<br>
<br>E:  Y-y-yes, yes 'tis I, your gorgeous little love bundle.
<br>
<br>A:  Oh George, I think you must be the snuggly wuggliest lambkin in the
<br>    whole of Toyland.
<br>
<br>PR: Yuch! (Blackadder silences him again)
<br>
<br>A:  What was that?
<br>
<br>E:  Am, em. Nothing, there was just a little fly in my throaty. Yuch!
<br>    Yuchh!
<br>
<br>A:  Do you want a hanky-wanky to gob the phlegmy wemmy woo into? (she
<br>    leans over the balcony, pulling a handkerchief from the top of her
<br>    dress)
<br>
<br>PR: Phwoah! Crikey!
<br>
<br>A:  Oh, what was that? Is there someone down there with you?
<br>
<br>E:  No, no, no, it was just the wind whistling through the trees and
<br>    making a noise that sounded like "phwoaaaah.. crikeeeeee".
<br>
<br>A:  Oh joy! Then come Prince Cuddlykitten, climb up my ivy.
<br>
<br>PR: Sausage time! (strides forward)
<br>
<br>A:  There is someone down there with you!
<br>
<br>E:  Oh my God, yes, yes, so there is, a filthy intruder spying on our love.
<br>
<br>A:  Oh hit him George, hit him!
<br>
<br>E:  Very well. (whispers to the Prince) Would you mind screaming, Your
<br>    Highness. (loudly) Take that. (punches him in the face) And that!
<br>    (knees him in the groin) And that! (hits his back; the Prince falls to
<br>    the ground)
<br>
<br>A:  Oh, oh, oh you're so brave! And I'm so worn out with all the
<br>    excitement that I'd better go sleepy-bo-bos, otherwise I'll be all
<br>    cross in the morning. Nighty-night Georgy Porgy!
<br>
<br>E:  Nighty-wighty Amy-wamy. (she vanishes; to the Prince) I think it
<br>    worked, sir. In the morning I shall go in and ask her father; you go
<br>    out and start spending his money. I can't stand meanness when it comes
<br>    to wedding presents. And well done sir, you were brilliant.
<br>
<br>PR: Was I?
<br>
<br>E:  Yes sir.
<br>
<br>PR: But I'm in agony!
<br>
<br>E:  Well, that's love for you.
<br>
<br>
<br>The Home of Amy Hardwood
<br>------------------------
<br>
<br>E:  Sir, I come as emissary of the Prince of Wales with the most
<br>    splendid news. He wants your daughter Amy for his wife.
<br>
<br>H:  Well his wife can't have her! Outrageous, sir, to come here with
<br>    such a suggestion! (stands up angrily) Why, sir, or I shall take off
<br>    my belt and by thunder me trousers will fall down!
<br>
<br>E:  No sir. Sir, you misunderstand. He wants to marry your lovely
<br>    daughter.
<br>
<br>H:  Ah, ah. (falls back into his chair, amazed) Can it be possibly true?
<br>    Surely love has never crossed such boundaries of class? (clutches
<br>    Amy's hand)
<br>
<br>A:  But what about you and Mum?
<br>
<br>H:  Well yes, yes, I grant thee when I first met her I was the farmer's
<br>    son and she was just the lass who ate the dung, but that was an
<br>    exception.
<br>
<br>A:  And Aunty Dot and Uncle Ted.
<br>
<br>H:  Yes, yes alright, he was a pig poker and she was the Duchess of
<br>    Argyle, but-
<br>
<br>A:  And Aunty Ruth and Uncle Isiah, she was a milkmaid and he was-
<br>
<br>H:  The Pope! Yes, yes, all right. Don't argue. Suffice it to say if you
<br>    marry we need never be poor or hungry again. Sir, we accept.
<br>
<br>E:  Good. So obviously you'll be wanting an enormous cer-e-mon-y- what
<br>    did you say?
<br>
<br>H:  Well obviously, eh, now we're marrying quality, we'll never be poor
<br>    or hungry again.
<br>
<br>E:  Meaning that you're poor and hungry at the moment?
<br>
<br>H:  (with feeling) Oh yes! We've been living off lard butties for five
<br>    years now. I'm so poor I use my underpants for drying dishes.
<br>
<br>E:  So you're skint?
<br>
<br>H:  Aye.
<br>
<br>E:  Well in that case, the wedding's off. Good day.
<br>
<br>A:  Oh but what about Georgy's lovey-wovey poems that won my
<br>    hearty-wearty?
<br>
<br>E:  All writteny witteny by mewee I'm afraidy-waidy. Goodbye.
<br>
<br>
<br>The Prince's Lounge
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>E:  Sir, you know I told you to go out and spend a lot of money on
<br>    wedding presents, well appar-
<br>
<br>PR: (sitting amongst a huge collection of glittering objects) Yes?
<br>
<br>E:  Nothing.
<br>
<br>
<br>The Kitchens
<br>------------
<br>
<br>(Blackadder enters, putting on a large black cape.)
<br>
<br>E:  Crisis Baldrick, crisis! No marriage, no money, more bills! For the
<br>    first time in my life I've decided to follow a suggestion of yours.
<br>    Saddle Prince George's horse.
<br>
<br>B:  Oh sir, you're not going to become a highwayman, are you?
<br>
<br>E:  No, I'm auditioning for the part of Arnold the Bat in Sheridon's new
<br>    comedy.
<br>
<br>B:  Oh, that's all right then.
<br>
<br>E:  Baldrick, have you no idea what irony is?
<br>
<br>B:  Yeah, it's like goldy and bronzy, only it's made of iron.
<br>
<br>E:  Never mind, never mind, just saddle the Prince's horse.
<br>
<br>B:  That'll be difficult, he wrapped it round that gas lamp in the
<br>    Strand last night.
<br>
<br>E:  Well saddle my horse then.
<br>
<br>B:  What d'you think you've been eating for the last two months?
<br>
<br>E:  Well go out into the street and hire me a horse.
<br>
<br>B:  Hire you a horse? For ninepence? On Jewish New Year in the rain? A
<br>    bare fortnight after the dreaded horse plague of old London Town? With
<br>    the blacksmith's strike in its fifteenth week and the Dorset horse
<br>    fetishists fair tomorrow?
<br>
<br>E:  Right, well get this on then. (hands Baldrick a bridle and bit) It
<br>    looks as though you could do with the exercise.
<br>
<br>
<br>Robbing the Cheapside Coach
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br>SC: Honestly Papa. Ever since Mother died you've tried to stop me
<br>    growing up. I'm not a little girl, I'm a grown woman. In fact I might
<br>    as well tell you now Papa: I'm pregnant, and I'm an opium fiend, and
<br>    I'm in love with a poet called Shelley who's a famous whoopsy, and
<br>    Mother didn't die, I killed her!
<br>
<br>DC: Oh. (cheerily) Well, never mind.
<br>
<br>E:  (off-screen) Stand and deliver! (the coach starts to pull up)
<br>
<br>DC: Oh no! Oh no no no no no, disaster! It's the Shadow. We're doomed,
<br>    doomed!
<br>
<br>E:  (draws up outside the window) Ah, good evening Duke, and the lovely
<br>    Miss Cheapside. Your cash bags please. (the Duke hands him a bag of
<br>    money) There we are.
<br>
<br>DC: You'll never get away with this, you scoundrel, you'll be caught
<br>    and damn well hung!
<br>
<br>SC: (to camera) I think he looks pretty well-
<br>
<br>E:  Madam, please, no jests about me looking pretty well hung already,
<br>    we have no time.
<br>
<br>SC: Pity.
<br>
<br>E:  Now sir, turn out your pockets.
<br>
<br>DC: Never sir. A man's pockets are his own private kingdom. I'll
<br>    protect them with my life!
<br>
<br>E:  Oh I see, you've got something embarrassing in there have you?
<br>    Perhaps a particularly repulsive handkerchief, hmm? One of those
<br>    fellows who has a big blow and then doesn't change it for a week?
<br>    Let's have a look shall we? (takes the handkerchief and pulls out a
<br>    jewel) Aha!
<br>
<br>SC: Highwayman, I also have a jewel. I fear however that I have placed
<br>    it here, beneath my petticoats, for protection.
<br>
<br>E:  Well in that case madam, I think I'll leave it. I'm not sure I fancy
<br>    the idea of a jewel that's been in someone's pants. A single kiss of
<br>    those soft lips is all I require.
<br>
<br>DC: Never sir! A man's soft lips are his own private kingdom. I shall
<br>    defend them with my life.
<br>
<br>E:  I'm not talking to you, Grandad.
<br>
<br>SC: (kisses him long and hard) Oh, I'm overcome. Take me with you to
<br>    live the life of the wild rogue, cuddling under haystacks and making
<br>    love in the branches of tall trees!
<br>
<br>E:  Madam, sadly I must decline. I fear my horse would collapse with you
<br>    on top of him as well as me!
<br>
<br>B:  (appears next to Blackadder, wearing his harness) I could try!
<br>
<br>E:  No Quicksilver, you couldn't.
<br>
<br>B:  But that's not fair then. I've had you on my back for ten miles and
<br>    I haven't even got a kiss out of it.
<br>
<br>E:  Oh alright, very well then. (kisses Baldrick) All fair now?
<br>
<br>B:  Not really, no.
<br>
<br>E:  Teh, no pleasing some horses. Hi-ho Quicksilver.
<br>
<br>B:  Neiighh!
<br>
<br>SC: (accusingly) Papa, you did nothing to defend my honour.
<br>
<br>DC: Oh shut your face, you pregnant junky fag-hag!
<br>
<br>
<br>A Grassy Knoll in the Forest
<br>----------------------------
<br>
<br>E:  Well Baldrick, a good night's work I think. It's time to divide the
<br>    loot, and I think it's only fair that we should share it equally.
<br>
<br>B:  Which I suppose is highwayman's talk for you get the cash, I get the
<br>    snotty hanky.
<br>
<br>E:  No, no. No, we did this robbery together, so you get half the cash.
<br>    (hands him a money-bag)
<br>
<br>B:  Oh, thank you Mr B.
<br>
<br>E:  This robbery, on the other hand, I'm doing alone. (holds his pistol
<br>    to Baldrick's head) Hand it over, your money or your life! (Baldrick
<br>    complies) You see? All fair and above board.
<br>
<br>B:  Fair enough. As long as I haven't been cheated, I don't mind.
<br>
<br>S:  Hands up! I am the Shadow and I never miss.
<br>
<br>E:  Oh no.
<br>
<br>S:  You, the one that looks like a pig.
<br>
<br>E:  He's talking to you Baldrick.
<br>
<br>S:  Skedaddle. (Shoots at Baldrick's feet; Baldrick runs away) So who
<br>    have we here? (takes off Blackadder's cap) Well, a well set up fellow
<br>    indeed. Sir, a kiss.
<br>
<br>E:  Sorry, I'm not sure I heard that correctly.
<br>
<br>SH: Oh dear, maybe your ears need unblocking. (holds his gun to
<br>    Blackadder's head)
<br>
<br>E:  Oh I see, a kiss, oh of course, of course, of course, and then
<br>    perhaps a little light supper, some dancing, who, who knows where it
<br>    might lead?
<br>
<br>(The Shadow wraps his cloak around Blackadder, kisses him, and then sweeps
<br>off his cap revealing long golden hair - it is Amy Hardwood.)
<br>
<br>E:  Good lord! It's you!
<br>
<br>A:  (deep Shadow voice) Of course.
<br>
<br>E:  But your voice, it's-
<br>
<br>A:  (normal voice) Clever, isn't it?
<br>
<br>E:  Does your father know you're out?
<br>
<br>A:  He had to go.
<br>
<br>E:  You mean he's dead?
<br>
<br>A:  Yes, dead as that squirrel!
<br>
<br>E:  Which squirrel? (she shoots a squirrel, which falls with an "eep"
<br>    and a thud) Oh, that squirrel. Of course, you killed him for ruining
<br>    your chances of marrying Prince George.
<br>
<br>A:  Huh, I despise the Prince. Don't you know it's you I want? I want a
<br>    real man. A man who can sew on a button. A man who knows where the
<br>    towels are kept. And yes, I crave your fabulous sinewy body.
<br>
<br>E:  Well, you're only human.
<br>
<br>A:  Here's the plan, brown eyes. You rob the Prince of everything he's
<br>    got, right down to the clothes he's standing in. I'll get my stash and
<br>    meet you here and then we'll run away to the West Indies.
<br>
<br>E:  Well I don't know I'll have to think about it. (pause) I've thought
<br>    about it, it's a brilliant plan. I'll see you here tomorrow.
<br>
<br>(Amy shoots another squirrel - "eep", thud.)
<br>
<br>
<br>The Kitchens
<br>------------
<br>
<br>E:  (finishing loading up a barrow of valuables) Right, I'm off.
<br>
<br>B:  Oh sir, but what about the danger? Look, the reward is going up day
<br>    by day. (holds up a poster, "Reward 5000 pounds")
<br>
<br>E:  Pah! I laugh in the face of danger. I drop ice cubes down the vest
<br>    of fear. Things couldn't be better Baldrick. She'll get me abroad and
<br>    make me rich, then I'll probably drop her and get two hundred
<br>    concubines to share my bed.
<br>
<br>B:  Won't they rather prickly?
<br>
<br>E:  Concubines Baldrick, not porcupines.
<br>
<br>B:  Oh. I still can't believe you're leaving me behind.
<br>
<br>E:  Oh, don't you worry. When we're established on our plantation in
<br>    Barbados, I'll send for you. No more sad little London for you
<br>    Balders, from now on you will stand out in life as an individual.
<br>
<br>B:  Will I?
<br>
<br>E:  Well of course you will, all the other slaves will be black.
<br>
<br>(Blackadder starts to wheel out his barrow; Mrs. Miggins rushes in.)
<br>
<br>MM: Oh! Mr Blackadder, oh, what's all this I hear about you buying a
<br>    bathing costume and forty gallons of coconut oil? Are you going abroad
<br>    then sir?
<br>
<br>E:  Yes, I'm off.
<br>
<br>MM: Oh sir, what a tragic end to all my dreams. And I'd always hoped that
<br>    you'd settle down and marry me and that together we might await the
<br>    slither of tiny Adders. (she sobs against Blackadder's chest)
<br>
<br>E:  Mrs M., if we were the last three humans on Earth, I'd be trying to
<br>    start a family with Baldrick!
<br>
<br>(Mrs. Miggins screams and cries.)
<br>
<br>
<br>On a Grassy Knoll
<br>-----------------
<br>
<br>E:  Well, here I am, all packed and ready to go.
<br>
<br>A:  Oh darling, I'm so pleased to see you, and I've got a little surprise
<br>for you. Close your eyes and open your mouth.
<br>
<br>E:  (does so) Mmmm.
<br>
<br>A:  (points her pistol in Blackadder's mouth) Ha, ha. Hand over the loot,
<br>    goat brains!
<br>
<br>E:  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. I, I always said the bedrock of a good 
<br>    relationship was being able to laugh together. Good, well done. So, 
<br>    which way to Barbados?
<br>
<br>A:  You're not going to Barbados. Get away from the cart, Mr Slimey, or
<br>    I'll fill you so full of lead we could sharpen your head and call you
<br>    a pencil.
<br>
<br>E:  This is turning into a really rotten evening.
<br>
<br>A:  Yes, well you better make the most of it, because it's your last.
<br>    And it's a pity, because it's usually against my principles to shoot
<br>    dumb animals.
<br>
<br>E:  Except squirrels?
<br>
<br>A:  Yes! Bastards! I hate them with their long tails and their stupid
<br>    twitchy noses. (shoots two squirrels, "eep", "eep") I shall return at
<br>    midnight to collect the loot, when I'll fill you so full of holes I
<br>    could market you as a new English cheese! (Shadow voice) Ha ha ha ha
<br>    ha!
<br>
<br>E:  Oh God! What a way to die! Shot by a transvestite on an unrealistic
<br>    grassy knoll!
<br>
<br>(Baldrick wanders up.)
<br>
<br>B:  Morning Mr B.
<br>
<br>E:  Bal- Baldrick? Baldrick! Thank you for introducing me to a genuinely
<br>    new experience.
<br>
<br>B:  What experience is that?
<br>
<br>E:  Being pleased to see you! Now what are you doing here, you revolting
<br>    animal?
<br>
<br>B:  I've come for the Shadow's autograph. You know I'm a great fan of
<br>    the Shadow's.
<br>
<br>E:  Yes, yes, just untie me Baldrick, come on.
<br>
<br>B:  What, has he gone? Oh what a pity, I wanted him to autograph my new
<br>    poster. Look, his reward has gone up to ten thousand pound.
<br>
<br>E:  Good lord, ten thousand pounds.
<br>
<br>B:  Yep.
<br>
<br>E:  That gives me an idea. Baldrick, take this cartload of loot back to
<br>    the palace and meet me back here at midnight, with ten soldiers, a
<br>    restless lynch mob and a small portable gallows.
<br>
<br>
<br>The Prince's Bedroom
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>(Blackadder enters with the Prince's breakfast tray.)
<br>
<br>PR: Aha, brekkers! I could eat fourteen trays of it this morning and
<br>    still have room for a dolphin on toast!
<br>
<br>E:  Any particular reason for this gluttonous levity sir?
<br>
<br>PR: Well, what do you think Blackadder, I'm in love! I'm in love, I'm
<br>    in love, I'm in love. Oh Amy, bless all ten of your tiny little
<br>    pinkies. Oh, let's see what's in the paper. (reads) Oh my God, she's
<br>    been arrested and hanged!
<br>
<br>E:  (casually) Oh really?
<br>
<br>PR: It turns out she was a highwayman!
<br>
<br>E:  Teh, these modern girls.
<br>
<br>PR: Apparently someone tipped off the authorities and collected the ten
<br>    thousand pound reward. What a greasy sneak. Oh, if only I could get my
<br>    hands on him.
<br>
<br>E:  Teh, you can't trust anyone these days sir.
<br>
<br>PR: It says here that she had an accomplice.
<br>
<br>(Alarmed, Blackadder drops the breakfast tray.)
<br>
<br>PR: But they don't know who it was.
<br>
<br>(The tray flies back up unto Blackadder's hands.)
<br>
<br>PR: Amy, Amy, Amy, I shall never forget you, never ever, ever ever!
<br>    (sobs into his pillow) Right, what's for breakfast?
<br>
<br>E:  Kedgeree, sir.
<br>
<br>PR: Great. Actually, come to think of it Blackadder, I didn't need to
<br>    get  married anyway. I've got pots of money.
<br>
<br>E:  Really?
<br>
<br>PR: Mmm. The most extraordinary thing happened. I was a bit peckish
<br>    during the night, so I nipped downstairs to the biscuit barrel.
<br>
<br>E:  (worried) The biscuit barrel?
<br>
<br>PR: And do you know what I found inside? (Blackadder nods despairingly)
<br>    Ten thousand pounds that I never knew I had! I've got so much money
<br>    now I don't know what to do with it!
<br>
<br>E:  How about a game of cards sir?
<br>
<br>PR: Excellent idea!
