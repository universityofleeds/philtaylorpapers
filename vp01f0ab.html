(he lights his own pipe)<br> <br>George: Private?<br> <br>Baldrick: (taking cigarette from George) Oh, thank you, sir.<br>	  (begins to eat the cigarette)<br> <br>George: Oh, dash and blast all this hanging about, sir! I'm as bored as<br>	a pacifist pistol. When are we going to see some action?<br> <br>Edmund: Well, George, I strongly suspect that your long wait for certain<br>        death is nearly at an end. Surely you must have noticed something <br>        in the air...<br> <br>George: Well, yes, of course, but I thought that was Private Baldrick.<br> <br>Edmund: Unless I'm very much mistaken, soon we will at last be making the<br>	final Big Push -- that one we've been so looking forward to all<br>	these years.<br> <br>George: Well, hurrah with highly polished brass knobs on! About time!<br> <br>	(phone rings within Baldrick's backpack, Edmund answers it)<br> <br>Edmund: Hello; the Somme Public Baths -- no running, shouting, or piddling in<br>	the shallow end. Ah, Captain Darling. Tomorrow at dawn. Oh, excellent.<br>	See you later, then. Bye. (hangs up) Gentlemen, our long wait is<br>	nearly at an end. Tomorrow morning, General Insanity Melchett invites<br>	you to a mass slaughter. We're going over the top.<br> <br>George: Well, huzzah and hurrah! God Save the King, Rule Britannia,<br>	and Boo Sucks the Hairy Hun!<br> <br>Edmund: Or, to put it more precisely: you're going over the top; I'm getting<br>	out of here. (goes inside dugout)<br> <br>George: (follows Edmund in) Oh, now, come on, Cap! It may be a bit risky<br>	(tries to speak in a rousing Cockney dialect, but fails miserably),<br>	but it sure is bloomin'ell worth it, gov'nor!<br> <br>Edmund: How could it possibly be worth it? We've been sitting here since<br>        Christmas 1914, during which millions of men have died, and we've<br>	advanced no further than an asthsmatic ant with some heavy shopping.<br> <br>George: Well, but this time I'm absolutely pos we'll break through! It's<br>	ice cream in Berlin in 15 days.<br> <br>Edmund: Or ice cold in No Man's Land in 15 seconds. No, the time has come<br>        to get out of this madness once and for all.<br> <br>George: What madness is that?<br> <br>Edmund: For God's sake, George, how long have you been in the army?<br> <br>George: Oh me? I joined up straight away, sir. August the 4th, 1914. Gah, what <br>        a day that was: myself and the rest of the fellows leapfrogging down<br>	to the Cambridge recruiting office and then playing tiddlywinks in the<br>	queue. We had hammered Oxford's tiddlywinkers only the week before,<br>	and there we were, off to hammer the Boche! Crashingly superb bunch of<br>	blokes. Fine, clean-limbed -- even their acne had a strange nobility<br>	about it. <br> <br>Edmund: Yes, and how are all the boys now?<br> <br>George: Well, er, Jacko and the Badger bought it at the first Ypres front,<br>	unfortunately -- quite a shock, that. I remember Bumfluff's house-<br>	master wrote and told me that Sticky had been out for a duck, and the<br>	Gubber had snitched a parcel sausage-end and gone goose-over-stump<br>	frogside.<br> <br>Edmund: Meaning...?<br> <br>George: I don't know, sir, but I read in the Times that they'd both been <br>        killed.<br> <br>Edmund: And Bumfluff himself...?<br> <br>George: Copped a packet at Galipoli with the Aussies -- so had Drippy and<br>	Strangely Brown. I remember we heard on the first morning of the<br>	Somme when Titch and Mr Floppy got gassed back to Blighty.<br> <br>Edmund: Which leaves...?<br> <br>George: Gosh, yes, I, I suppose I'm the only one of the Trinity Tiddlers<br>	still alive. (Lummy?), there's a thought -- and not a jolly one.<br> <br>Edmund: My point exactly, George.<br> <br>George: A chap might get a bit (mizz?) -- if it wasn't the thought of going<br>	over the top tomorrow! Right, sir: Permission to get weaving...<br> <br>Edmund: Permission granted.<br> <br>George: Thank you, sir.<br> <br>Edmund: Baldrick!<br> <br>Baldrick: (entering) Captain B!<br> <br>Edmund: This is a crisis. A large crisis. In fact, if you've got a moment,<br>	it's a twelve-storey crisis with a magnificent entrance hall,<br>	carpetting throughout, 24-hour portrage, and an enormous sign on<br>	the roof, saying `This Is a Large Crisis'. A large crisis requires<br>	a large plan. Get me two pencils and a pair of underpants.<br> <br> <br>(Later, Edmund wears underpants on his head with two pencils up his nose)<br> <br>Edmund: Right, Baldrick, this is an old trick I picked up in the Sudan. We <br>        tell HQ that I've gone insane, and I'll be invalided back to Blighty<br>	before you can say "Wooble" -- a poor gormless idiot.<br> <br>Baldrick: But I'm a poor gormless idiot, sir, and I've never been invalided<br>	  back to Blighty.<br> <br>Edmund: Yes, Baldrick, but you've never said "Wooble." Now, ask me some simple<br>        questions.<br> <br>Baldrick: Right. What is your name?<br> <br>Edmund: Wooble...<br> <br>Baldrick: What is two plus two?<br> <br>Edmund: Oh, wooble wooble.<br> <br>Baldrick: Where do you live?<br> <br>Edmund: London.<br> <br>Baldrick: Eh?<br> <br>Edmund: A small village on Mars, just outside the capital city, Wooble.<br> <br>George: (enters) All the men present and correct, sir. Ready for the off, eh?<br> <br>Edmund: I'm afraid not, Lieutenant; I'm just off to Hartleypool to buy some<br>	exploding trousers.<br> <br>George: Come again, sir -- have you gone barking mad?<br> <br>Edmund: Yes, George, I have. Cluck, cluck, gibber, gibber, my old man's<br>        a mushroom, et cetera. Go send a runner to tell General Melchett that<br>        your captain has gone insane and must return to England at once.<br> <br>George: But, sir, how utterly ghastly for you! I mean, well, you'll miss the<br>	whole rest of the war!<br> <br>Edmund: Yes, very bad luck. Beep!<br> <br>George: Right.<br> <br>Edmund: Beep!<br> <br>George: Baldrick, I'll be back as soon as I can.<br> <br>Edmund: Pah-pah!<br> <br>George: Whatever you do, don't excite him. (leaves)<br> <br>Edmund: (removing the pencils, looks at Baldrick) Fat chance! Now, all we<br>	have to do is wait. Baldrick, fix us some coffee, will you? And try<br>	to make it taste slightly less like mud this time.<br> <br>Baldrick: Not easy, I'm afraid, Captain.<br> <br>Edmund: Why is this?<br> <br>Baldrick: 'cause it is mud. We ran out of coffee thirteen months ago.<br> <br>Edmund: So every time I've drunk your coffee since, I have in fact been<br>	drinking hot mud...<br> <br>Baldrick: With sugar.<br> <br>Edmund: Which of course makes all the difference.<br> <br>Baldrick: Well, it would do if we had any sugar, but, unfortunately, we ran<br>	  out New Year's Eve 1915, since when I've been using sugar substitute.<br>        <br>Edmund: Which is...?<br> <br>Baldrick: Dandruff.<br> <br>Edmund: Brilliant.<br> <br>Baldrick: Still, I could add some milk this time -- well, saliva...<br> <br>Edmund: No, no, thank you, Baldrick. Call me Mr Picky, but I think I'll<br>	cancel the coffee.<br> <br>Baldrick: That's probably 'cause you're mad, sir!<br> <br>Edmund: Well, quite!<br> <br>George: (re-enters; Edmund quickly replaces the pencils) Well, it didn't go<br>	down well at all, I'm afraid, sir. Captain Darling said they'd be<br>	along directly, but, well, you'd better be damn doolally.<br> <br>Edmund: Don't worry, George; I am (makes weird noises while moving his right<br>	arm strangely). When they get here, I'll show them what `totally and<br>	utterly bonkeroonie' means. Fwaf! Until then, we've got bugger-all to<br>	do except sit and wait.<br> <br>George: Well, I don't know, sir -- we could, er, we could have a jolly game<br>	of charades!<br> <br>Baldrick: Ooh, yes!<br> <br>George: And a singalong of musical hits like "Birmingham Bertie" and "Whoops,<br>        Mrs Miggins, You're Sitting On My Artichokes."<br> <br>Edmund: Yes, I think bugger-all might rather be more fun.<br> <br> <br>(later, the three are sitting around doing bugger-all)<br> <br>Baldrick: Permission to ask a question, sir...<br> <br>Edmund: Permission granted, Baldrick, as long as isn't the one about where<br>        babies come from.<br> <br>Baldrick: No, the thing is: The way I see it, these days there's a war on,<br>          right? and, ages ago, there wasn't a war on, right? So, there must<br>          have been a moment when there not being a war on went away, right?<br>	  and there being a war on came along. So, what I want to know is:<br>	  How did we get from the one case of affairs to the other case of<br>	  affairs?<br> <br>Edmund: Do you mean "How did the war start?"<br> <br>Baldrick: Yeah.<br> <br>George: The war started because of the vile Hun and his villainous empire-<br>        building.<br> <br>Edmund: George, the British Empire at present covers a quarter of the globe,<br>	while the German Empire consists of a small sausage factory in<br>	Tanganyika. I hardly think that we can be entirely absolved of blame<br>	on the imperialistic front.<br> <br>George: Oh, no, sir, absolutely not. (aside, to Baldick) Mad as a bicycle!<br> <br>Baldrick: I heard that it started when a bloke called Archie Duke shot an <br>          ostrich 'cause he was hungry.<br> <br>Edmund: I think you mean it started when the Archduke of Austro-Hungary got<br>        shot.<br> <br>Baldrick: Nah, there was definitely an ostrich involved, sir.<br> <br>Edmund: Well, possibly. But the real reason for the whole thing was that it<br>	was too much effort *not* to have a war.<br> <br>George: By (Gum? [it's not `God']) this is interesting; I always loved<br>	history -- The Battle of Hastings, Henry VIII and his six knives,<br>	all that.<br> <br>Edmund: You see, Baldrick, in order to prevent war in Europe, two superblocs<br>	developed: us, the French and the Russians on one side, and the<br>	Germans and Austro-Hungary on the other. The idea was to have two<br>	vast opposing armies, each acting as the other's deterrent. That way<br>	there could never be a war.<br> <br>Baldrick: But this is a sort of a war, isn't it, sir?<br> <br>Edmund: Yes, that's right. You see, there was a tiny flaw in the plan.<br> <br>George: What was that, sir?<br> <br>Edmund: It was bollocks.<br> <br>Baldrick: So the poor old ostrich died for nothing.<br> <br>Darling: (from outside) 'tention!<br> <br>George: (he and Baldrick stand) Right, they're here. Erm, Baldrick, you keep<br>	him warm; I'll go prepare the ground. (leaves)<br> <br>	(outside, George salutes Melchett and Darling)<br> <br>George: Sir.<br> <br>Melchett: George! How's the patient?<br> <br>George: Well, it's touch and go, I'm afraid, sir. I really can't vouch for his<br>	behaviour. He's gone mad, you see -- stir-frying crazy.<br> <br>Melchett: I see. Is this genuinely mad?<br> <br>George: Oh, yes, sir.<br> <br>Melchett: ...or has he simply put his underpants on his head and stuffed a<br>	  couple of pencils up his nose? That's what they all used to do in<br>	  the Sudan. I remember I once had to shoot a whole platoon for<br>	  trying that. Well, let's have a look at him.  (goes in, followed<br>	  by the others)<br> <br>Darling: 'tention!!!<br> <br>Edmund: (stands, talks to Baldrick) ...and the other thing they used to do in<br>	the Sudan is to get dressed up like this and pretend to be mad. But<br>	don't let me catch you trying that one, Baldrick, or I'll have you<br>	shot, all right? Dismissed. (turns to Melchett, removes the pencils)<br>	Oh, hello, sir -- didn't hear you come in.<br> <br>Melchett: Well now, Blackadder, they tell me you've gone mad.<br> <br>Edmund: No, sir (removes the underpants), no -- must be a breakdown of<br>	communication. Someone obviously heard I was mad with excitement,<br>	waiting for the off.<br> <br>Melchett: There you are, you see, Darling? I told you there'd be a perfectly<br>	  rational explanation. Right, George, have your chaps fall in.<br> <br>George: Very good, sir. (salutes, leaves)<br> <br>Darling: Well, it's rather odd, sir. The message was very clear: "Captain<br>	 Blackadder gone totally tonto. Bring straightjacket for immediate<br>	 return to Blighty." (holds up straightjacket)<br> <br>Melchett: Don't be ridiculous, Darling. The Hero of Mboto Gorge, mad? Well,<br>	  you've only got to look at him to see he's as sane as I am! Beeaaah!<br>	  (leaves)<br> <br>Darling: Would that the Mboto Gorge where we massacred the peace-loving<br>	 pygmies of the Upper Volta and stole all their fruit?<br> <br>Edmund: No -- a totally different Mboto Gorge.<br> <br>Darling: Oh.<br> <br>Edmund: Cup of coffee, Darling?<br> <br>Darling: Oh, thank you.<br> <br>Edmund: Baldrick, do the honours.<br> <br>Baldrick: (comes from kitchen) Sir. (to Darling) Sugar, sir?<br> <br>Darling: Three lumps.<br> <br>Edmund: Think you can manage three *lumps*, Baldrick?<br> <br>Baldrick: I'll rummage around, see what I can find, sir. (turns back to<br>	  kitchen)<br> <br>Darling: Make it a milky one.<br> <br>Baldrick: Coming up, sir.<br> <br>	(outside; while Melchett and George speak, Baldrick can be heard<br>	 hawking up a great deal of `milk')<br> <br>Melchett: Well, George, you must have been delighted to hear the news of the<br>	  Big Push.<br> <br>George: Absolutely, sir -- our chance to show the Hun that it takes more than<br>	a pointy hat and bad breath to defeat the armies of King George!<br> <br>Melchett: That's the spirit!<br> <br>	(inside, Baldrick spits, then returns with the mug)<br> <br>Baldrick: Here you are, sir.<br> <br>Darling: (looks in the mug) Ah, cappucino! Have you got any of that brown<br>	 stuff you sprinkle on the top?<br> <br>Baldrick: Well, I'm sure I could m--<br> <br>Edmund: No, no!<br> <br>Darling: (as Melchett and George return) 'tention!<br> <br>Melchett: Well, fine body of men you've got out there, Blackadder.<br> <br>Edmund: Yes, sir -- shortly to become fine bodies of men.<br> <br>Melchett: Nonsense -- you'll pull through. (laughs) I remember when we played<br>          the old Harrovians back in '96: they said we never could break<br>	  through to their back line, but we ducked and we bobbed and we wove<br>	  and we damn well won the game, 15-4.<br> <br>Edmund: Yes, sir, but the Harrow fullback wasn't armed with a heavy machine<br>	gun.<br> <br>Melchett: No -- that's a good point. Make a note, Darling...<br> <br>Darling: Sir.<br> <br>Melchett: "Recommendation for the Harrow Governors: Heavy machine guns for<br>	  fullbacks." Bright idea, Blackadder. (speaks to Baldrick) Now then,<br>	  soldier, are you looking forward to giving those Frenchies a damn<br>	  good licking?<br> <br>Darling: Er, no, sir -- it's the Germans we shall be licking, sir.<br> <br>Melchett: Don't be revolting, Darling! I wouldn't lick a German if he was<br>	  glazed in honey!<br> <br>Darling: Sorry.<br> <br>Melchett: (back to Baldrick) Now then, soldier, do you love your country?<br> <br>Baldrick: Certainly do, sir.<br> <br>Melchett: And do you love your king?<br> <br>Baldrick: Certainly don't, sir.<br> <br>Melchett: And why not?<br> <br>Baldrick: My mother told me never to trust men with beards, sir.<br> <br>Melchett: (laughs) Excellent native Cockney wit! (hits Baldrick in the face;<br>	  Baldrick falls over) Well, best of luck to you all. Sorry I can't be<br>	  with you, but obviously there's no place at the front for an old<br>	  general with a dicky heart and a wooden bladder. By the way, George,<br>	  if you want to accompany me back to HQ and watch the results as they<br>	  come in, I think I can guarantee a place in the car.<br> <br>George: Oh, no, thank you, sir -- I wouldn't miss this show for anything. I am<br>        as excited as a very excited person who's got a special reason to be<br>	excited, sir.<br> <br>Melchett: Excellent! Well, (chuf chuf?) then. See you all in Berlin for coffee<br>	  and cakes.<br> <br>Goerge: Sir. (salutes)<br> <br>	(As Melchett begins to walk out, Darling drinks then spits out<br>	 the `coffee'.)<br> <br>Melchett: What is the matter with you today, Darling? I'm so sorry,<br>	  Blackadder. Come on, Darling, we're leaving. (he and Darling leave)<br> <br>George: Righto, sir, I'm glad you're not barking anymore.<br> <br>Edmund: Well, thank you, George -- although quite clearly you are. You were<br>	offered a way out, and you didn't take it.<br> <br>George: Absolutely not, sir! I can't wait to get stuck into the Boche!<br> <br>Edmund: You won't have time to get `stuck into the Boche'! We'll all be cut<br>	to pieces by machine gun fire before we can say "charge."<br> <br>George: All right, so, what do we do now?<br> <br>Baldrick: Can I do my war poem?<br> <br>Edmund: How hurt would you be if I gave the honest answer, which is "No, I'd <br>        rather French-kiss a skunk"?<br> <br>Baldrick: So would I, sir!<br> <br>Edmund: All right. Fire away, Baldrick.<br> <br>Baldrick: "Hear the words I sing / War's a horrid thing / So I sing sing<br>	  sing / ding-a-ling-a-ling."<br> <br>George: (applauding) Oh, bravo, yes!<br> <br>Edmund: Yes. Well, it started badly, it tailed off a little in the middle,<br>	and the less said about the end, the better. But, apart than that,<br>	excellent.<br> <br>Baldrick: Oh, shall I do another one, then, sir?<br> <br>Edmund: No -- we wouldn't want to exhaust you.<br> <br>Baldrick: No, don't worry; I could go on all night.<br> <br>Edmund: Not with a bayonet through your neck, you couldn't!<br> <br>Baldrick: This one is called "The German Guns."<br> <br>George: Oh, spiffing! Yes, let's hear that!<br> <br>Baldrick: "Boom boom boom boom / Boom boom boom / BOOM BOOM, BOOM BOOM--<br> <br>Edmund: "BOOM BOOM BOOM"?<br> <br>Baldrick: How did you guess, sir?<br> <br>George: I say, sir! That is spooky!<br> <br>Edmund: I'm sorry, I think I've got to get out of here!!!<br> <br>Baldrick: Well, I have a cunning plan, sir.<br> <br>Edmund: All right, Baldrick -- for old time's sake.<br> <br>Baldrick: Well, you phone Field Marshal Haig, sir, and you ask him to get<br>	  you out of here.<br> <br>Edmund: (stands) Baldrick, even by your standards it's pathetic! I've only<br>	ever met Field Marshal Haig once, it was twenty years ago, and, my<br>	god, you've got it, you've got it! (he kisses Baldrick's hat)<br> <br>Baldrick: Well, if I've got it, you've got it too, now, sir.<br> <br>Edmund: I can't believe I've been so stupid! One phone call will do it -- one <br>        phone call and I'll be free. Let's see, it's 3.30 a.m.; I'll call<br>        about quarter to six. Excellent, excellent. Well, I'll get packing.<br> <br>George: You know, I won't half miss you chaps after the war.<br> <br>Baldrick: Don't worry, Lieutenant; I'll come visit you.<br> <br>George: Will you really? Oh bravo! Yes, jump into the old jalopy and come down<br>        and stay in the country, and we can relive the old times.<br> <br>Edmund: What, dig a hole in the garden, fill it with water, and get your<br>	gamekeeper to shoot at us all day?<br> <br>George: You know, that's the thing I don't really understand about you, Cap.<br>	You're a professional soldier, and yet, sometimes you sound as though<br>	you bally well haven't enjoyed soldiering at all.<br> <br>Edmund: Well, you see, George, I did like it, back in the old days when the<br>        prerequisite of a British campaign was that the enemy should under<br>        no circumstances carry guns -- even spears made us think twice. The<br>	kind of people we liked to fight were two feet tall and armed with<br>	dry grass.<br> <br>George: Now, come off it, sir -- what about Mboto Gorge, for heaven's sake?<br> <br>Edmund: Yes, that was a bit of a nasty one -- ten thousand Watusi warriors<br>        armed to the teeth with kiwi fruit and guava halves. After the battle,<br>        instead of taking prisoners, we simply made a huge fruit salad. No, <br>        when I joined up, I never imagined anything as awful as this war.<br>        I'd had fifteen years of military experience, perfecting the art of<br>        ordering a pink gin and saying "Do you do it doggy-doggy?" in <br>        Swahili, and then suddenly four-and-a-half million heavily armed<br>	Germans hoved into view. That was a shock, I can tell you.<br> <br>Baldrick: (polishing boots with a dead rat) I thought it was going to be such<br>	  fun, too -- we all did -- joining the local regiment and everything:<br>	  The Turnip Street Workhouse Powers. It was great. I'll never forget<br>	  it. It was the first time I ever felt really popular. Everyone was<br>	  cheering, throwing flowers. Some girl even come up and kissed me.<br> <br>Edmund: Poor woman -- first casualty of the war.<br> <br>Baldrick: I loved the training; all we had to do was bayonet sacks full of<br>	  straw. Even I could do that. I rememeber saying to my mum, "These<br>          sacks will be easy to outwit in a battle situation." And then,<br>	  shortly after, we all met up, didn't we? just before Christmas,<br>	  1914.<br> <br>George: Yes, that's right. I'd just arrived and we had that wonderful<br>	Christmas truce. Do you remember, sir? We could hear "Silent Night"<br>	drifting across the still, clear air of No Man's Land. And then they<br>	came, the Germans, emerging out of the freezing night mist, calling<br>	to us, and we clambered up over the top and went to meet them. <br> <br>Edmund: Both sides advanced more during one Christmas piss-up than they<br>	managed in the next two-and-a-half years of war.<br> <br>Baldrick: Do you remember the football match?<br> <br>Edmund: Remember it? How could I forget it? I was never offside! I could not<br>	believe that decision!<br> <br>Baldrick: And since then we've been stuck here for three flipping years! We <br>          haven't moved! All my friends are dead: My pet spider, Sammy; Katie<br>          the worm; Bertie the bird -- everyone except Neville the fat<br>	  hamster.<br> <br>Edmund: (having just finished his packing; sits) I'm afraid Neville bought<br>	it too, Baldrick. I'm sorry.<br> <br>Baldrick: Neville, gone, sir?<br> <br>Edmund: Actually, not quite gone -- he's in the corner, bunging up the sink.<br>        <br>Baldrick: (stands) Oh no, it didn't have to happen, sir! If it wasn't for this<br>	  terrible war, Neville would still be here today, sniffling his<br>	  little nose and going "Eek."<br> <br>Edmund: On the other hand, if he hadn't died, I wouldn't have been able to<br>	insert a curtain rod in his bottom and use him as a dishmop.<br> <br>Baldrick: Why can't we just stop, sir? Why can't we just say, "No more killing;<br>          let's all go home"? Why would it be stupid just to pack it in, sir,<br>          why?<br> <br>George: Now, now, now, look here, you just stop that (conchy?) talk right now,<br>	Private. It's, it's absurd, it's Bolshevism, and it wouldn't work,<br>	anyway.<br> <br>Baldrick: Why not, sir?<br> <br>George: "Why not?" Well, what do you mean? "Why wouldn't it work?" It--<br>	It wouldn't work, Private-- It wouldn't work because, there, well,<br>	now, you just get on with polishing those boots, all right? and let's<br>	have a little bit less of that lip! (to Edmund) I think I managed to<br>	crush the mutiny there, sir. Well, to think, sir: in just a few hours,<br>	we'll be off. Of course, not that I wouldn't miss all this, sir.<br>	I mean, we've had some good times; we've had damnably good laughs, eh?<br> <br>Edmund: Yes -- can't think of any specific ones, myself, but...<br> <br> <br>(Melchett's office. Darling is asleep at the desk. Melchett comes in with<br> a candle. He is wearing a robe, and a hairnet for his moustache.)<br> <br>Melchett: Darling.<br> <br>Darling: (with a start, stands) Sir!<br> <br>Melchett: Oh, sit sit sit sit... Can't sleep either, eh?<br> <br>Darling: Er, no, sir -- thinking about the Push, sir, hoping the Boche will<br>	 forget to set their alarm clocks, oversleep, and still be in their<br>	 pyjamas when our boys turn up, sir.<br> <br>Melchett: Yes, yes. I've been thinking, too, Darling.<br> <br>Darling: Sir?<br> <br>Melchett: You know, over these last few years, I've come to think of you as<br>	  a sort of son. Not a favourite son, of course -- lord, no! -- more<br>	  a sort of illegitimate backstairs sort of sprog, you know: a sort<br>	  of spotty squit that nobody really likes. But, nonetheless, still<br>	  fruit of my overactive loins.<br>          <br>Darling: Thank you, sir.<br> <br>Melchett: And I want to do what's best for you, Darling, so I've given it<br>	  a great deal of thought, and I want you to have this.  (picks up<br>	  a piece of paper from the desk and hands it to Darling)<br> <br>Darling: A postal order for ten shillings...<br> <br>Melchett: No, sorry -- that's my godson's wedding present. (picks up another<br>	  piece of paper) Here.<br> <br>Darling: Er, no, sir -- this is the commission for the front line, sir.<br>	 (holds it out, to give it back)<br> <br>Melchett: Yes. I've been awfully selfish, Darling, keeping you back here<br>	  instead of letting you join in the fun and games. This will let<br>	  you get to the front line immediately!<br> <br>Darling: But, but, sir, I, I don't want to.<br> <br>Melchett: ...to leave me? Heh, I appreciate that, Darling, but, damn it, I'll<br>	  just have to enter Berlin without someone to carry my feathery hat.<br> <br>Darling: (stands) No, sir, I don't want to go into battle.<br> <br>Melchett: ...without me. I know. But I'm too old, Darling. I'm just going to<br>	  have to sit this one out on the touchline with the halftime oranges<br>	  and the fat, wheezy boys with a note from matron, while you young-<br>	  bloods link arms and go together for the glorious final scrumdown.<br> <br>Darling: No, sir... (walks around the desk to Melchett) You're, you're not<br>	 listening, sir. I'm begging you, please -- for the sake of all the<br>	 times I've helped you with your dicky bows and dicky bladder --<br>	 please (falls to his knees), don't make me--<br> <br>Melchett: ...make you go through the farewell debagging ceremony in the mess.<br>	  Heh! No, I've spared you that, too, you touchingly sentimental young<br>	  booby! Look: no fuss, no bother -- the driver is already here.<br> <br>Darling: (turns, still on his knees, as the door opens; a shadow of the<br>	 driver is cast from the bright light in the next room [extra bright<br>	 for dramatic effect]; the driver salutes) But--<br> <br>Melchett: No, no -- not a word, Kevin. I know what you want to say. I know.<br>          (Darling stands slowly) Goodbye, Kevin Darling. (salutes)<br> <br>Darling: (frightened, salutes) Goodbye, sir.<br> <br> <br>(dawn, in the dugout)<br> <br>Baldrick: (enters) It's stopped raining at last, sir, begging your pardon --<br>	  looks like we might have a nice day for it.<br> <br>George: Yes, it's nearly morning...<br> <br>Edmund: (peeks outside) Good lord -- so it is. Right, time to make my call.<br>	(winds the telephone) Hello? Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, please.<br>	Yes, it's urgent...<br> <br>	(Haig picks up and is looking over a model of the battlefield.)<br> <br>Haig: Haig.<br> <br>Edmund: Hello, Sir Douglas.<br> <br>Haig: Who is this?<br> <br>Edmund: Captain Blackadder, sir, erstwhile of the 1945th East African rifles.<br> <br>Haig: Good lord! Blacky! (knocks down an entire line of model soldiers)<br> <br>Edmund: Yes, sir.<br> <br>Haig: I haven't seen you since... (knocks down the second line of model<br>      soldiers on the same side)<br> <br>Edmund: '92, sir -- Mboto Gorge.<br> <br>Haig: By jingo, yes. We sure gave those pygmies a good squashing.<br> <br>Edmund: We certainly did, sir. And do you remember...?<br> <br>Haig: My god, yes. You saved my damn life that day, Blacky. If it weren't for<br>      you, that pygmy woman with the sharpened mango could have seriously...<br> <br>Edmund: Well, exactly, sir. And do you remember then that you said that if<br>	I was ever in real trouble and I really needed a favour that I was<br>	to call you and you'd do everything you could to help me?<br> <br>Haig: (sweeps the fallen soldier models into a dustpan) Yes, yes, I do, and<br>      I stick by it. You know me -- not a man to change my mind.<br> <br>Edmund: No -- we've noticed that.<br> <br>Haig: So what do you want? Spit it out, man. (hurls the dead platoon over<br>      his shoulder)<br> <br>Edmund: Well, you see, sir, it's the Big Push today, and I'm not all that<br>	keen to go over the top.<br>        <br>Haig: (sits) Oh, I see. Well...<br> <br>Edmund: It was a viciously sharp slice of mango, wasn't it, sir...<br> <br>Haig: (fiddles with one of the soldiers) Well, this is most irregular, but,<br>      erm, all right. If I do fix it for you, I never want to hear from you<br>      again, is that clear?<br> <br>Edmund: Suits me, Douggy.<br> <br>Haig: Very well. Listen carefully, Blackadder; I won't repeat this. Put your<br>      underpants on your head and stick two pencils up your nose. They'll<br>      think you're crazy and send you home. Right, favour returned. (hangs up)<br> <br>Edmund: (hanging up his end) I think the phrase rhymes with `clucking bell'.<br> <br>Baldrick: Does that mean you'll going over the top, now, sir?<br> <br>	(phone rings, Edmund quickly picks it up)<br> <br>Edmund: Field Marshal?<br> <br>Melchett: (on the other end, laughs) Well, not quite, Blackadder -- at least<br>	  not yet. No, I just wanted to let you know I've sent a little<br>	  surprise over for you.<br> <br>	(Darling enters, wearing helmet)<br> <br>George: Sir! (salutes)<br> <br>Edmund: (hangs up the phone, turns) Captain Darling...<br> <br>Darling: Captain Blackadder.<br> <br>Edmund: Here to join us for the last waltz?<br> <br>Darling: (nervous) Erm, yes -- tired of folding the general's pyjamas.<br> <br>George: Well, this is splendid, comradely news! Together, we'll fight for king<br>	and country, and be sucking sausages in Berlin by teatime.<br> <br>Edmund: Yes, I hope their cafes are well stocked; everyone seems determined<br>	to eat out the moment they arrive.<br> <br>George: No, really, this is brave, splendid and noble!  Sir?<br> <br>Edmund: Yes, Lieutenant?<br> <br>George: I'm scared, sir.<br> <br>Baldrick: I'm scared too, sir.<br> <br>George: I mean, I'm the last of the tiddlywinking leapfroggers from the Golden<br> 	Summer of 1914. I don't want to die. I'm really not overkeen on	dying<br>	at all, sir.<br> <br>Edmund: How are you feeling, Darling?<br> <br>Darling: Erm, not all that good, Blackadder -- rather hoped I'd get through the <br>         whole show; go back to work at Pratt & Sons; keep wicket for the<br>	 Croydon gentlemen; marry Doris... Made a note in my diary on my way<br>	 here. Simply says, "Bugger."<br> <br>Edmund: Well, quite.<br> <br>	(a voice outside gives orders)<br> <br>Voice: (??)! (??)!<br> <br>Edmund: Ah well, come on. Let's move.<br> <br>Voice: Fix bayonets!<br> <br>	(They start to go outside)<br> <br>Edmund: Don't forget your stick, Lieutenant.<br> <br>George: Oh no, sir -- wouldn't want to face a machine gun without this!<br> <br>	(outside, they all line up as the shelling stops)<br> <br>Darling: Listen! Our guns have stopped.<br> <br>George: You don't think...?<br> <br>Baldrick: Maybe the war's over. Maybe it's peace!<br> <br>George: Well, hurrah! The big knobs have gone round the table and yanked the<br>        iron out of the fire!<br> <br>Darling: Thank God! We lived through it! The Great War: 1914-1917. <br> <br>George: Hip hip!<br> <br>All but Edmund: Hurray!<br> <br>Edmund: (loading his revolver) I'm afraid not. The guns have stopped because<br>	we're about to attack. Not even our generals are mad enough to shell<br>	their own men. They think it's far more sporting to let the Germans<br>	do it.<br> <br>George: So we are, in fact, going over. This is, as they say, it.<br> <br>Edmund: I'm afraid so, unless I think of something very quickly.<br> <br>Voice: Company, one pace forward!<br> <br>	(everyone steps forward)<br> <br>Baldrick: Ooh, there's a nasty splinter on that ladder, sir! A bloke could<br>	  hurt himself on that.<br> <br>Voice: Stand ready!<br> <br>	(everyone puts a foot forward)<br> <br>Baldrick: I have a plan, sir.<br> <br>Edmund: Really, Baldrick? A cunning and subtle one?<br> <br>Baldrick: Yes, sir.<br> <br>Edmund: As cunning as a fox who's just been appointed Professor of Cunning<br>	at Oxford University?<br> <br>Baldrick: Yes, sir.<br> <br>Voice: On the signal, company will advance!<br> <br>Edmund: Well, I'm afraid it'll have to wait. Whatever it was, I'm sure it was<br>	better than my plan to get out of this by pretending to be mad.<br>	I mean, who would have noticed another madman round here?<br> <br>	(whistle blows)<br> <br>Edmund: Good luck, everyone. (blows his whistle)<br> <br>	(Everyone yells as they go over the top. German guns fire before<br>	 they're even off the ladders. The scene changes to slow motion,<br>	 and explosions happen all around them. [An echoed piano slowly plays<br>	 the Blackadder theme.] The smoke and flying earth begins to obscure<br>	 vision as the view changes to the battlefield moments later: empty<br>	 and silent with barbed wire, guns and bodies strewn across it. [A<br>	 bass drum beats slowly.] That view in turn changes to the same field<br>	 as it is today: overgrown with grasses and flowers, peaceful, with<br>	 chirping birds.)<br> <br> B L A C K A D D E R<br>(C) BBC tv  MCMLXXXIX<br><br><br><br>
