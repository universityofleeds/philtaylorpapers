If I<br>	have two beans, and then I add two more beans, what do I have?<br>B:      Some beans.<br>BA:     Yes...and no. Let's try again shall we? I have two beans, then I add two<br>	more beans. What does that make?<br>B:      A very small casserole.<br>BA:     Baldrick, the ape creatures of the Indus have mastered this. Now try<br>	again. One, two, three, four. So how many are there?<br>B:      Three<br>BA:     What?<br>B:      And that one.<br>BA:     Three and that one. So if I add that one to the three what will I have?<br>B:      Oh! Some beans.<br>BA:     Yes. To you Baldrick, the renaissance was just something that happened<br>	to other people wasn't it?<br>Enter P wearing an enormous rough.<br>P:      Edmund, Edmund, come quickly the queen wants to see you.<br>BA:     What-<br>P:      I said "Edmund, Edmund, come quickly the queen wants to see-"<br>BA:     Please let me finish. What, are you wearing round your neck?<br>P:      Ah! It's my new rough!<br>BA:     You look like a bird who's swallowed a plate!<br>P:      It's the latest fashion actually and as a matter of fact it makes me<br>	look rather sexy!<br>BA:     To another plate swallowing bird perhaps. If it was blind and hadn't<br>	had it in months.<br>P:      I think you may be wrong.<br>BA:     You're a sad laughable figure aren't you Percy? What do you think of<br>	Percy's rough Baldrick?<br>B:      Four.<br>BA:     What?<br>B:      Some beans and some beans is four beans.<br>BA:     No, no. We've moved on from advanced mathematics, we're onto elementary<br>	dressmaking. What do you think of Percy's rough?<br>B:      I think he looks like a bird who's swallowed a plate my Lord.<br>BA:     No that's what I think, that's what I think! What do you think?<br>	Try to have a thought of your own, Baldrick, thinking is so<br>	important. What do you think?<br>B:      I think thinking is so important my Lord.<br>BA:     I give up! I'm off to see the queen.<br>P:      Oh shall I come too my Lord?<br>BA:     No, best not, people might think we're friends. You stay here with<br>	Baldrick.Bird neck and bird brain should get on like a house on fire!<br><br>SCENE 2 (The Royal Palace)<br>-------<br>M:      Grey, I suspect Majesty.<br>Q:      I think you'll find it was orange Lord Melchett.<br>M:      Grey is more usual mam.<br>Q:      Who's queen ?<br>M:      As you say Majesty, there were these magnificent orange<br>	elephants which were coming.....<br>BA:     My Lady (Queeny screams), you wish to see me.<br>Q:      Yes, Lord Melchett has bad news.<br>BA:     Lord Melchett is bad news.<br>Q:      (Laughs) No, be serious. Melchett!<br>M:      Unhappily Blackadder, the Lord High Executioner is dead.<br>BA:     Oh woe ! Murdered of course.<br>M:      No, oddly enough no. They usually are but this one just got<br>	careless one night and signed his name on the wrong dotted<br>	line. They came for him while he slept.<br>BA:     He should have told them they had the wrong man.<br>M:      Oh he did, but you see they didn't, they had the right man<br>	and they had the form to prove it.<br>BA:     Te. bloody red tape eh ? And the bad news ?<br>Q:      The bad news is that actually there are simply hundreds of<br>	catholics who desperately want their heads sneaked off and<br>	there's no-one to organise it.<br>BA:     Hm, well I pity the poor sod who gets the job.<br>	No-one ever survives it more than a week.<br>M:      Mhm. I have taken the liberty mam, of drawing up a list of suitable<br>	candidates.<br>Q:      Oh goodo, let's hear it.<br>M:      List for the post of Lord High Executioner -<br>	Lord Blackadder.<br>BA:     Ah He.<br><br>SCENE 3  (Back at Edmund Blackadder's home)<br>-------<br>BA:     Right then. Let's take a look shall we? Who's first into the head basket<br>	then? Admiral Lord Ethingham and Sir Francis Drake on Monday.<br>P:      That should draw a crowd.<br>BA:     Hm?<br>P:      Well, sailing enthusiasts.<br>BA:     Oh yes, better make sure there's a few anchors and things on the<br>	souvenier stall.<br>P:      Aye, aye, sir.<br>BA:     Never, ever try to be funny in my presence again Percy. Right,<br>	Buckingham and Ponsonby on Friday. Oh wait a minute. Farrow on<br>	Wednesday. Who's Farrow when he's not having his head cut off?<br>P:      Ah, James Farrow, pleasant bloke from Dorchester.<br>BA:     Don't know him, never will either. Yes, and he goes on Wednesdsay?<br>P:      Hmm.<br>BA:     It's not right though, is it?<br>P:      Well no! I mean now you come to mention it, my Lord, there was<br>	absolutely no evidence against young Farrow at all! It was an outrageous<br>	travesty of justice!<br>BA:     No, it's not right that he should be on Wednesday when we could stick<br>	him in on Monday and have half the week off.<br>P:      Oh I see. Yes, that's right.<br>BA:     Pop him in on Monday. Right, good! Five dead in two days. Not a bad<br>	start. Oh yes Percy, and the new rough?<br>P:      Better?<br>BA:     Worse.<br>P:      Ah, the fashion today is towards the tiny.<br>BA:     In that case, Percy, you have the most fashionable brain in London.<br><br><br>SCENE 4 (At the jails)<br>-------<br>BA:     Right, good morning team. My name is Edmund Blackadder<br>	and I'm the new minister in charge of religious genocide.<br>	Now, if you play straight with me you'll find me a considerate<br>	employer, but cross me and you'll find that under this playful<br>	boyish exterior beats the heart of a ruthless sadistic maniac.<br>	Now my man you are ?<br>MRP:    Eh, jailor Sir, my Lord.<br>BA:     Good, well done and your name is ?<br>MRP:    Ploppy Sir.<br>BA:     Ploppy ?<br>MRP:    Yes Sir.<br>BA:     Ploppy the jailor ?<br>MRP:    That's right Sir. Ploppy son of Ploppy.<br>BA:     Ploppy, son of Ploppy the jailor ?<br>MRP:    Ah ach no Sir. I am the first Ploppy to rise to be jailor.<br>	My father, Daddy Ploppy was known as Ploppy the slopper.<br>	It was from him that I inherited my fascinating skin diseases.<br>BA:     Yes you are to be congratulated, my friend, we, we live in an age<br>	where illness and deformity are common place and yet Ploppy, you are<br>	without a doubt the most repulsive individual that I have ever met.<br>	I would shake your hand but I fear it would come off.<br>MRP:    There's no many bosses would be that considerate sir.<br>BA:     Thank you Ploppy, I do my best. Now then woman. if indeed you are a<br>	woman, what is your function on death row ?<br>MRSP:   I'm the last meal cook Sir. The prisoners may ask for what they fancy<br>	for there last meal.....<br>BA:     And you cook for them what they desire ?<br>MRSP:   Oh yes Sir, provided they ask for sausages. Otherwise they tend to get<br>	a tiny bit disappointed. Sausages is all I got.<br>BA:     You are clearly a woman of principle and compassion mistress eh ?<br>MRSP:   Ploppy Sir.<br>BA:     Ah, so you are married to...<br>MRSP:   No, many people think that but it's pure coincidence. We did laugh<br>	when first we found out. "Good morning" mistress Ploppy he'd say,<br>	and I'd say "good morning ..<br>MRP&<br>MRSP:   Mr. Ploppy" (both laugh)<br>BA:     The long winter evenings must just fly by. Ah ! and you must be the<br>	boy who makes the tea ?<br>MRP:    Ah no Sir, he's the executioner but he does sometime make the tea.<br>BA:     Yes, and your name is ?<br>B:      Baldrick my Lord, but I'll change it to Ploppy if it'll make things<br>	easier.<br>BA:     No thank you. I can cope with more than one name. What are you doing<br>	here ?<br>B:      Well, it's a hobby<br>MRSP:   It would be more, more fun Sir if he were to change his name. Give the<br>	place a more family atmosphere.<br>BA:     A family atmpsphere ? This is meant to be a place of pain and misery<br>	and sorrow.<br>MRSP:   That's what I mean Sir.<br>MRP:    Eh, Mistress Ploppy is a bit of a social realist Sir.<br>BA:     Now then, we're going to run a fast efficient operation and I intend to<br>	do as little work as possible. My deputy Percy here will explain.<br>P:      Good afternoon staff, my name is Lord Percy and if you play fair by me<br>	you will find me a considerate employer, but if you cross me BY JOVE,<br>	you ...<br>BA:     Just tell'em the plan duckface.<br>P:      My Lord, not in front of the staff.<br>BA:     Get on with it.<br>P:      Right Staff, as you know we are scheduled to execute Drake and<br>	Ethingham on Monday, Lord Farrow on Wednesday and Buckingham and<br>	Ponsonby on Friday. But in order to give us the middle of the week off,<br>	Lord Blackadder has decided to move Farrow to Monday.<br>BA:     Lets just say he's got time off for good behaviour.<br><br>SCENE 5 (The Royal Palace)<br>-------<br>LF:     Your Majesty.<br>Q:      Yes Lady Farrow?<br>LF:     My husband dies tomorrow. I besiege you, even if you cannot save his<br>	life-<br>Q:      Which I don't think either of us would want seeing as how he's a<br>	horrible traitor!<br>LF:     Of course not Your Majesty. But if he must die, may I see him?<br>Q:      But of course. What's she asking me for? Why doesn't she just go along<br>	to the execution with everyone else?<br>M:      No Your Majesty, I don't beleive she wants to see him die, I believe<br>	she wants to see him before he dies.<br>Q:      How odd.<br>M:      Your Majesty?<br>Q:      She's not seen him! I wouldn't marry someone I'd never seen. You should<br>	take marriage a bit more seriously next time!<br>LF:     (cries)<br>Q:      Oh come now Lady Farrow, crying isn't going to help your husband now.<br>N:      No! Ointment! That's what you need when your head's been cut off!<br>	That's what I gave your sister Mary when they done her. "There, there"<br>	I said, "you'll soon grow a new one."<br>Q:      Shut up Nursie. Of course you may see your husband my dear, and if the<br>	horrid old Edmund tries to stop you give him this. It's a warrent, for<br>	his own execution!<br>LF:     Oh thank you Mam. May flights of angels sing you to your rest!<br>Q:      Yes, I'm sure they will!<br><br>SCENE 6  (Blackadder's Home)<br>-------<br><br>P:      Hip, hip ...<br>BA:     So, they're all dead are they ?<br>P:      Yep, all three Drake, Ethingham, Farrow<br>MA:     Splendid, any interesting last words<br>P:      Well Farrow was rather moving my Lord. A great strong man, he stood<br>	there, gaunt and noble in the early morning mist and in a loud clear<br>	voice he cried out "My wife might have bloddy well turned up"<br>BA:     Ha, she's probably shacked up with some new pair of tights already.<br>	Right well unless Lord Percy has anything to add, you lot can amuse<br>	yourselves in whatever foul depraved way you feel fit til' Friday.<br>MRP&P:  Thank you Sir.<br>P:      Well staff, eh I've got a few notes on today's show. On the whole I was<br>	impressed<br>BA:     They've gone Percy<br>P:      Eh eh eh team, team.<br>B:      My Lord, there is a lady outside to see you.<br>BA:     Oh is she pretty ?<br>B:      I don't know, what d'you think?<br>BA:     Well I don't know do I? I haven't seen her yet.<br>	Make yourself scarce Baldrick.<br>B:      Oh right.<br>LF:     Good evening Lord Blackadder.<br>BA:     Well it certainly is now. Perhaps you'd like to slip into something<br>	more comfortable.<br>LF:     No, my lord, for there is a great pain in my heart.<br>BA:     It's probably indigestion, I'll soon take your mind off that.<br>LF:     It's my husband.<br>BA:     Your husband's got indigestion? Well, he won't be bothering us then.<br>LF:     No, he dies tomorrow.<br>BA:     Oh come, you can't die of indigestion, you're over dramatising.<br>LF:     He is to be executed at your order. I am Lady Farrow.<br>BA:     Ah, and what exactly did you want of me?<br>LF:     I wish to see my husband tonight.<br>BA:     Ehe! Not really possible actually.<br>LF:     (Starts to whimper)<br>BA:     Excuse me just a second. Baldrick!<br>B:      My lord?<br>BA:     That Farrow bloke you executed today, are you sure he's dead?<br>B:      Well I chopped his head off, that usually does the trick.<br>BA:     Yes, don't get clever with me Baldrick. I just thought you might have<br>	lopped off a leg or something by mistake.<br>B:      No, the thing I chopped off had a nose.<br>BA:     Fine!<br>	Yes, I'm so sorry. I've just been consulting my legal people and I'm<br>	afraid there really is no chance of a meeting.<br>LF:     But the queen told me it would be allowed.<br>BA:     Really?<br>LF:     Yes, and that if you said "no", I should give you this.<br>BA:     Eh he! Fine, fine, absolutely, why not?<br><br>SCENE 7 (At the jails)<br>-------<br><br>BA:     Right Baldrick, is that all clear?<br>B:      Yes, em, I've killed someone I shouldn't have killed, and now you want<br>	me to put a lady on my head and talk to his old bag.<br>BA:     No, I want you to put a bag on your head and talk to his old lady.<br>B:      Why? Why do I want a bag on my head?<br>BA:     In order, ningcompoop, that she should believe that you're her husband.<br>B:      Why, did he used to wear a bag on his head?<br>MRP:    Young, young Ploppy here has a point My Lord, Lord Farrow never wore a<br>	bag, he was an old fashioned sort of gent.<br>BA:     Look-<br>P:      Well, yes, My Lord, I mean, I hadn't meant to mention it but I have been<br>	wondering all along why you should think Baldrick with a bag on his head<br>	is going to be a dead ringer for Lord Farrow, because he's not!<br>BA:     Look, cretins, the bag is there in order to obscure Baldricks own<br>	features, and many might think, incidently, that that would be reason<br>	enough for him to wear it. Before I bring in Lady Farrow I shall explain<br>	to her, inventing some cunningly plausible excuse, that her husband has<br>	taken to wearing a bag. She can then chat to Baldrick imagining him to<br>	be the man she married and the queen need never know of my little<br>	miscalculation.<br>MRP:    Why, My Lord, that is a brilliant plan.<br>P:      Foolproof.<br>BA:     You're very kind.<br>MRP:     Although there is something lurking at the back of my head that bothers<br>	me.<br>BA:     It's probably a flea.<br>Enter MRSP<br>MRSP:   Your lordship, Lady Farrow awaits your pleasure.<br>BA:     All right, OK. Go on, quick! Quick!<br>Exit P,MRP,MRSP<br>BA:     Ah, Lady Farrow, what a real pleasure it is to see you again.<br>LF:     It is my beloved that I shall be pleased to see.<br>BA:     Well quite, quite. Though I should warn you that he, eh, he will not be<br>	quite as you knew him.<br>LF:     You fiend! What have you done to him?<br>BA:     We have put.... a bag over his head.<br>LF:     Why?<br>BA:     Well, the thing is, you see, none of the other prisoners have such<br>	shapely widows, baa wives I should say, and therefore in the interests<br>	of the condemned community, your husband has nobly agreed to wear a bag.<br>	It was either that or have all the other prisoners in there with you.<br>LF:     How like him to make such a gesture.<br>BA:     Yes, yes. Well I'll just go and check he's bagged up. Right Balders,<br>	this is it.<br>Enter MRP,P<br>MRP:    My lord!<br>BA:     Oh what is it now Ploppy?<br>MRP:    I have located my nagging doubt. It's a small point, but I do now recall<br>	that Lord Farrow was considerably taller, more than a yard taller, than<br>	young Ploppy here.<br>BA:     If you want something done properly you've got to do it yourself,<br>	haven't you? Anything else I should know?<br>MRP:    Oh yes, he had a very deep voice, big deep booming voice.<br>BA:     So quite like mine then?<br>MRP:    No, my lord, a big deep booming voice.<br>BA:     Well mine's quite deep.<br>MRP:    Ah not like his, and in fact, he was even taller than you, my lord. Oh<br>	a giant of a man.<br>BA:     Yes, all right, all right, don't rub it in. Percy, you'd better go<br>	and have another word with her. Go on, go on.<br>P:      Em, sorry about the delay madam, eh, as you know, you are about to meet<br>	your husband, whom you will recognise on account of the fact that he has<br>	a bag over his head.<br>LF:     Why I would know my darling anywhere.<br>P:      Well, yes, there are a couple of other things.<br>LF:     I am prepared for the fact that he may have lost some weight.<br>P:      Yes, and some height. That's the interesting thing, eh, you'll<br>	probably hardly recognise him at all actually.<br>LF:     You'll be telling me his arm's grown back next.<br>P:      Eh, excuse just for a sec. He's only got one arm!!!<br>MRP:    Ah yes!<br>BA:     Oh well I shall just have to stick it inside the shirt. Which one?<br>	Which one?<br>P:      Eh, eh, hang on! Em hang on! Em, em, eh, how do we know you're his wife?<br>LF:     What?<br>P:      Em, well, you know, you could be a gloater.<br>LF:     I beg pardon.<br>P:      You know, a gloater, eh, come to gloat over the condemned man. I mean<br>	we're up to our ears is gloaters here. "Can I come in for a gloat?" they<br>	shout and we shout back "Oh you heartless gloaters".<br>LF:     (cries)<br>P:      All right, all right, I tell you what. I'll believe you're not a<br>	gloater if you tell me which arm he hasn't got.<br>lf:     His left of course! Now let me see my husband!<br>P:      Right! it's the left. Good luck!<br>BA:     Gloaters, you really are a pratt aren't you Percy ?<br>	Right, don't forget in two minutes you interrupt me all right ?<br>	And no more than two minutes otherwise I'm in real trouble, and don't<br>	forget because..?<br>B:      Because we're not at home to Mr. Cockup!<br>BA:     Correct.<br>MRP:    Remember the voice my lord.<br>BA:     Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.<br>Exit B, P, MRP.<br>BA:     Enter.<br>LF:     James?<br>BA:     My darling!<br>LF:     How are you?<br>BA:     Oh fine, fine. Food's not bad. Apart from the sausages.<br>LF:     You're voice is somehow different.<br>BA:     Oh, how?<br>LF:     Somehow lighter, not as deep or booming as once it was.<br>BA:     Is that better?<br>LF:     Oh my darling! Oh call me by that name you always called me to show<br>	your love is still strong.<br>BA:     Ah yes, look, do you think this is quite the time or the place for<br>	that sort of thing ?<br>LF:     Please!<br>BA:     Em this is the specific secret little name that I always used to<br>	call you? You want to be called it again, is that right?<br>LF:     Yes, the one like 'your little pumpkin'.<br>BA:     The one like 'your little pumpkin' but not actually 'your little<br>	pumpkin' ?<br>LF:     No.<br>BA:     Em, right then, my little pumpkinywumpkiny ?<br>LF:     Oh my darling! AH! Your arm!<br>BA:     What's wrong with it?<br>LF:     What happened to it?<br>BA:     Well, well, I'm rather hurt you don't remember yourself in fact.<br>LF:     But it was only cut off at the elbow.<br>BA:     Aagh!<br>LF:     What happened to the rest?<br>BA:     Ah, yes, well, well I got into a scrap here with a fellow who called<br>	you a nosey little strumpet who was always going blubbing to the<br>	queen.<br>LF:     Oh!<br>BA:     And we got into a fight, and he cut off the top half.<br>LF:     Oh alas!<br>BA:     Eh, ah, yes of course, well I think you'd better be going. Lord<br>	Blackadder said he was going to be sending in his servant Baldrick<br>	to collect me.<br>LF:     Perhaps, my lord, he is leaving us for a little longer.<br>BA:     Oh no, no, no. I shouldn't think so. BALDRICK!!<br>	He's usually very punctual.<br>LF:     Perhaps this Baldrick is doing it out of kindness.<br>BA:     Oh no, I shouldn't think so. BALDRICK!! He, he he's a very unkind<br>	person.<br>LF:     Well then, let us leap on the moment that we have been given and use<br>	it to its full.<br>BA:     What ?<br>LF:     Let me do this last thing for you! What wife could do more ?<br>BA:     What? Oh, I see.<br>Enter B.<br>B:      Right, that's it. Time up!<br>BA:     No it isn't.<br>B:      Yes it is! Come along. Time's up! Come along.<br>LF:     Oh we've had so little time. May we finish what we began in paradise.<br>	Farewell.<br>B       Farewell.<br>Exit LF.<br>BA:     Baldrick, you bastard! You utter bastard!<br>	That was the first time ever, in my whole life. I've been on this<br>	pultry, boring planet for 30 years and that's the first time ever<br>	anyone has ever attempted...<br>Enter LF.<br>LF:     But do not despair my lord. Your brother petitions the queen tomorrow<br>	morning. There may still be hope!<br>Exit LF.<br>BA:     What?<br>B:      Shall I prepare the guest room for Mr. Cockup my lord ?<br><br><br>SCENE 8  (The Royal Palace)<br>-------<br><br><br>Q:      Oh yes alright then, let him off. He probably is innocent anyway.<br>F:      My lady! May the heavens rain down radiant jewels and sweet meats<br>	apon you.<br>Q:      Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!<br>F:      And may Cherabim and Seraphim.....<br>Q:      Out!<br>BA:     My lady, about Lord Farrow.<br>Q:      I've let him off.<br>BA:     No, no, no, no, you can't. He's a complete cad of the first water.<br>Q:      'Can't' is not a word for princes Lord Blackadder.<br>M:      How very true majesty.<br>Q:      Anyway, I won't be argued with, will I Nursey?<br>N:      Well sometimes my darling when you want something very naughty. No<br>	you won't be argued with absolutely not.<br>Q:      Precisely. So Lord Backadda ha! I want to see Lord Farrow here in<br>	1 hour. Meanwhile, I shall spend the time visiting my old friend Lord<br>	Ponsonby who I believe I'm having killed on Friday - Come on Nursey,<br>	let's see if there are any good heads in Traitor's Cloister on the way!<br>BA:     Percy, this is a very difficult situation.<br>P:      Yes, my lord.<br>BA:     Someone's for the chop. You or me in fact.<br>P:      Ah yes.<br>BA:     Let's face facts Perc, it's you!<br>P:      Except, Exc-ept, I may have a plan.<br>BA:     Oh yes.<br>P:      Yes, eh, eh. How about if we get Lord Farrow's head and body and we<br>	take it to the queen, except, exc-ept just before we get in,we start<br>	shouting and screaming, and then we come in saying "We were just on<br>	our way when he said something traitorous and so we cut his head off<br>	in the corridor just to teach him a lesson".<br>BA:     Pathetic! Absolutely pathetic! Contemptable! Worth a try. Where did<br>	we put the head?<br>P:      It's on a spike in traitor's cloister.<br>BA:     Oh God, well that's where the queen's gone! Did she know Farrow?<br>P:      Oh yes, they were childhood friends.<br>BA:     Well what if she sees his head on a spike? She'll, she'll, she'll<br>	realise he's dead!<br>P:      Yes.<br>BA:     You fetch the body, and I'll cover the head.<br><br><br>SCENE 9 (Traitor's cloister)<br>-------<br><br>Q:      Oh! Hello Edmund. Look I'm sorry I snapped at you just now. You know<br>	I'm really very keen on you indeed don't you ?<br>BA:     Oh yes mam, as you were keen on Essex.<br>Q:      Exactly!<br>BA:     Right up to the point at which you had his head cut off.<br>Q:      (laughs) He didn't mind that, he knew it was only little me! And I<br>	must say, his head did look jolly super on its spike. Are there no<br>	heads on spikes today ?<br>BA:     Em, no. No, we're training up a new executioner and he's a little<br>	immature. Takes him forever. Slash, slash, slash. By the time he's<br>	finished you don't so much need a spike as a toast rack.<br>Q:      I like toast. Still, must be off to say bye bye to Ponsonby. Would you<br>	care to stroll with me a while just if you've got time, if you're<br>	not to busy.<br>BA:     No, sorry mam, affairs at office-<br>Q:      I said "Would you care to stroll with me a while, just if you've got<br>	time, if YOU'RE NOT TOO BUSY!"<br>BA:     It would make the decade wothwhile!<br><br>				---------------<br><br>BA:     And in Genoa, 'tis now the fashion to pin a live frog to the shoulder<br>	braid, stand in a bucket and go "bibble" at passers by.<br>Q:      Oh, our Italian cousins!<br>BA:     Well if you'll excuse me mam, I've got some business to attend to.<br>Q:      Certainly. But first Edmund, take my hand. Tell me you forgive my<br>	former sharpness.<br>BA:     Em. M'lady<br>Q:      Sweet Lord Blackadder.<br>Exit Q,N. Enter P.<br>BA:     Percy.<br>P:      Well, I've got the body my lord and I see you've got the head.<br>BA:     Yes but look it's no good Percy, no-one's ever going to believe<br>	we've just cut it off, it's gone green! We're doomed.<br>P:      Doomed. Oh wait a moment, that's not Farrow!<br>BA:     Isn't it ?<br>P:      No, that's Ponsonby.<br>BA:     My God, Ponsonby! That genius Baldrick has killed the wrong bloke.<br>	We're saved.<br>P:      Saved.<br>BA:     Then Farrow is alive and we're saved.<br>P:      Hooray!<br>BA:     And when the queen gets back from seeing Ponsonby we'll - Oh God!<br>P:      Oh doomed! Doomed!<br><br><br>SCENE 10  (At the jails)<br>--------<br><br>Q:      It's not very nice here is it?<br>N:      No, it's not meant to be my pikelet. This is where all the horrid<br>	people who don't like you live.<br>Q:      Hmm, I suppose so. It's a bit smelly too, isn't it?<br>N:      Ah well of course I'm used to that. In the mornings when you were a<br>	little baby ....<br>Q:      Shut up Nursey! You - No not you, you're too repulsive. You!<br>B:      Yes, your Royal Majestic highness.<br>Q:      Bring in Lord Ponsonby.<br>B:      Yes your royal majestic .. thing!<br>Q:      So strange, Ponsonby turned out to be a traitor. You would have thought<br>	that he'd have had problems enough - what with that hunch, and only<br>	having one leg!<br>N:      Yes and that terrible speech problem<br>P:      Your majesty.. Lord Ponsonby<br>BA:     Your royal majesty. Sorry about the baaag. Didn't have time to shave !<br><br>				THE END<br>				=======<br><br><br><br>
