Blackadder's Christmas Carol
<br> 
<br>Narrator:  In the reign of good Queen Vic, there stood, in Dumpling Lane
<br>	   in old London towne, the Moustache Shoppe of one Ebenezer
<br>	   Blackadder -- the kindest and loveliest man in all England.
<br> 
<br>	[opening theme]
<br> 
<br>	He's kind and gen'rous to the sick
<br>	He'd never spread a nasty rumour
<br>	He never gets on people's wick
<br>	And doesn't laugh at toilet humour
<br> 
<br>	Blackadder! Blackadder!
<br>	He's sickeningly good
<br>	Blackadder! Blackadder!
<br>	As nice as Christmas pud.
<br> 
<br>	[as this is sung, we see a man merrily enjoying some carolers, and
<br>	 nicking something from their donation bin (I think that's what it
<br>	 is, at least); also, a boy wanders through the streets, picking
<br>	 pockets]
<br> 
<br>	[Scene: inside the Moustache Shoppe.  Baldrick is dusting off
<br>	 a mustache which is on a stand.]
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  [from outside the main door]  Humbug!  Humbug!
<br>	   [enters, holding a bag of candies]
<br>	   [holds out the bag, in offering]  Humbug, Mr Baldrick?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Oh, thank you very much.  [takes one]
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Well, I've got all the presents...
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  ...and I've nearly finished the Christmas cards.
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  [taking off his tall hat]  Oh, splendid! Let me see...
<br>	   [opens up a card he has picked up from the desk]
<br>	   "A Very Messy Christmas."  I'm sorry, Mr Baldrick -- shouldn't
<br>	   that be `merry'?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  "A Merry Messy Christmas"?  All right, but the main thing is that
<br>	   it should be messy -- messy cake; soggy pudding; great big wet
<br>	   kisses under the mistletoe...
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Yes... [going to hang up his coat and scarf]  I fear, Mr
<br>	   Baldrick, that the only way you're likely to get a big wet
<br>	   kiss at Christmas -- or, indeed, any other time -- is to make
<br>	   a pass at a water closet.
<br> 
<br>	   However, be that as it may... [Baldrick gives him the card again]
<br>	   "A Merry Messy Christmas."  `Christmas' as an H in it, Mr Baldrick.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Oh...
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  ...and an R.  Also an I, and an S.  Also T and M and A...
<br>	   ...and another S.  Oh, and you've missed out the C at the
<br>	   beginning.  Congratulations, Mr Baldrick!  Something of a
<br>	   triumph, I think -- you must be the first person ever to
<br>	   spell `Christmas' without getting any of the letters right at all.
<br> 
<br>	[He takes the bag of presents he brought from outside into the
<br>	 back room.]
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  [following Ebenezer]  Well, I was a bit rushed.  I've been
<br>	   helping out with the workhouse nativity play.
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Oh, of course! How did it go?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Well, not very well -- at the last moment, the baby playing
<br>	   Jesus died!
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Oh, dear! This high infant-mortality rate is a real devil when
<br>	   it comes to staging quality children's theatre.  What did you do?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Got another Jesus.
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Oh, thank goodness.  ...and his name?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  `Spot'.  There weren't any more children, so we had to settle for
<br>	   a dog instead.
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Oh, dear...  [moving toward and eventually sitting on a chair
<br>	   near the fireplace]  I'm not convinced that Christianity would
<br>	   have established its firm grip over the hearts and minds of
<br>	   mankind if all Jesus had ever said was "Woof."
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  [as Ebenezer removes his shoes]  Well, it went all right until
<br>	   the shepherds came on.  See, we hadn't been able to get any real
<br>	   sheep, so we had to stick some wool--
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  ...on some other dogs.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Yeah... and the moment Jesus got a whiff of them, he's away!
<br>	   While the angel's singing "Peace on Earth, Goodwill to Mankind,"
<br>	   Jesus scampers across and tries to get one of the sheep to give
<br>	   him a piggyback ride!
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Scarcely appropriate behaviour for the son of God, Mr Baldrick.
<br>	   Weren't the children upset?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Nah, they loved it.  They want us to do another one at Easter --
<br>	   they want to see us nail up the dog.
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Ah, the playful young scamps, eh?  Still, what a lovely thought
<br>	   it is: at this very moment, all over the country, from the
<br>	   highest to the lowest, through those charming plump folks
<br>	   somewhere in the middle, everyone is enjoying Christmas.
<br> 
<br>	[Scene changes to a room in Buckingham Palace.  Queen Victoria
<br>	 enters, followed by the chair-bearer (what's the proper
<br>	 name for such an individual?), and approaches Prince Albert, who
<br>	 is wrapping something.  He speaks with a ridiculous accent.]
<br> 
<br>Victoria:  [knowing that Albert's wrapping a present for her]
<br>	   What are you doing, Albert?
<br> 
<br>Albert:  [hiding something]  Nothing...
<br> 
<br>Victoria:  Oh yes you are, you naughty German sausage!  [sits]
<br>	   Tell me what you're doing...
<br> 
<br>Albert:  I just said; I'm not doing anything!  Really, woman -- when you're
<br>	 busy ruling India, you don't tell me what >you< are doing...
<br>	 So why should I tell you what >I< am doing when I am busy wrapping
<br>	 up this cushion for your surprise Christmas present?
<br> 
<br>	 Damn...
<br> 
<br>	 Now I have only two surprise presents for you...
<br> 
<br>Victoria:  Oh, dear Alby, don't worry -- I don't mind.
<br> 
<br>Albert:  I >dowhat< traditional Christmas adventure?
<br> 
<br>Victoria:  You silly soldier!  You know: when we disguise ourselves as
<br>	   common folk and go out amongst the people to reward the
<br>	   virtuous and the good...
<br> 
<br>Albert:  Oh, yes! Of course!  Dummkopf!	 [stands]  How could I forget?
<br>	 [he shouts something in German]
<br>	 [He reaches down, to pick up something and starts unwrapping it.]
<br>	 For it is for precisely such an outing as this that I have bought
<br>	 you my finest surprise present: this muff which I am going to
<br>	 give you tomorrow--
<br> 
<br>	 Damn...  Damn...  Damn...
<br> 
<br>	[As he falls to his knees, Victoria pushes his face into her bosom.]
<br> 
<br>	[Scene changes back to Ebenezer's living room.  He and Baldrick
<br>	 have just finished setting things on the table.]
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Ah, excellent, excellent.  What a splendid spread: nuts, turkey
<br>	   and presents.  What more could a man desire at Christmas?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Well, a tree...
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Oh, of course -- I'd quite forgot.  [he heads to the front,
<br>	   shop room]  I dropped in on Mr Thicktwistle's Garden Emporium,
<br>	   and, I think you'll agree, got quite a bargain [he opens the
<br>	   front door and steps out to fetch something] on this special
<br>	   Christmas Twig.  [steps back in, closes the front door]
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  It's a bit of a tiddler, ain't it?
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Yes, but size isn't important, my friend; it's not what
<br>	   you've got -- it's where you stick it.  [sticks the twig into
<br>	   an empty candle stand]  Besides, look: we've got a whole
<br>	   year's profits to spend on fun and larks!
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  How much is it?
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Seventeen pounds and a penny.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  It'd be a lot more if you didn't give away so much money to
<br>	   the poor.
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Well, yes, but in the feeling-good ledger of life we are rich
<br>	   indeed.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Yeah, I just wish we weren't doing so well in the
<br>	   bit-short-of-prezzies-and-feeling-a-gullible-prat ledger.
<br> 
<br>	[The doorbell rings.]
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Well, bless my ten toes!  Who could that be on this cold night?
<br> 
<br>	[Baldrick opens the door.  Mrs Scratchit enters, carrying a basket.]
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Ah, Mrs Scratchit!  Greetings to you on this merry Yuletide Eve.
<br> 
<br>Scratchit:  [crying]  Oh, Mr Blackadder!!!  How can I be merry when we are
<br>	    so poor we shall have nothing to eat on Christmas Day? except
<br>	    what Grandfather can scrape from under his big toenail...
<br>	    No goose for Tiny Tom this year!!!
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Mrs Scratchit, Tiny Tom is fifteen stone and he's built like
<br>	   a brick privy!  If he eats any more heartily, he will turn
<br>	   into a pie shop.  [this is all said in the nicest way possible]
<br> 
<br>	[Scratchit bawls]
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  [As he walks around the counter]  Oh, pardon me, but, look, look,
<br>	   there must be something we can do... [points inside her basket]
<br>	   Ah! That box of matches in your basket is just the thing I need.
<br>	   How much did they cost?
<br> 
<br>Scratchit:  [holding up the box, suddenly not crying]  A quid a match.
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Mrs Scratchit, I suspect that to be a lie of sorts...
<br> 
<br>	[Scratchit puts on her crying act again]
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  [rushing round the counter]  ...oh, but, but it's Christmas Eve,
<br>	   so here: take ten pounds. 
<br> 
<br>Scratchit:  So you don't want all the matches, then -- there's seventeen
<br>	    of them!
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Mrs Scratchit, you have the body of a weak woman, but the mind
<br>	   of a criminal genius!  Here: seventeen pounds, then.
<br> 
<br>Scratchit:  [quite happy, speaking rather like having completed a swindle
<br>	    that she has done many times before]  Lovely!  [leaves]
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  [calls after her] ...and my best wishes to your massive offspring!
<br> 
<br>	[Baldrick closes the door]
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  So: we had seventeen pound and a penny, and we've given Mrs
<br>	   Scratchit seventeen pounds, so that leaves...
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  [sighs, holding up the penny]  Yes, come on, Mr Baldrick;
<br>	   seventeen pounds and a penny minus seventeen pounds leaves...?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  [looks at the penny while thinking, then speaks with confidence]
<br>	   Thirty-eight pounds, eight shillings, fourpence!
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Not bad, Mr Baldrick.  The answer is in fact a splendid shining
<br>	   penny.
<br> 
<br>	[The door opens; a boy steps in and speaks]
<br> 
<br>Boy:  Merry Christmas Eve, Mr Slackbladder -- I mean Blackadder!
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  [approaching]  Ah! and to you, young urchin!
<br> 
<br>Boy:  A penny for Christmas cheer, sucker -- I mean sir?
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  [looks at his penny, knowing it's all he has]  Erm, well...
<br> 
<br>	[Boy fakes a tantrum]
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Well, certainly! Here!  [tosses penny over]
<br> 
<br>	[Boy catches it and immediately runs off]
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  [steps out, calling after Boy]  Er, going to buy some cake and
<br>	   pie for yourself and your silver-haired mother?
<br> 
<br>Boy:  Nah, sod that -- I'm off to the gin shop.
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  [returning inside]  Che! They grow up so fast these days,
<br>	   bless 'em.  Oh well -- another year without profit!  Still,
<br>	   it >is< Christmas, and let us remember, Mr Baldrick [he takes
<br>	   the candle stand which holds the twig, and returns to the back
<br>	   room], that, be we as stony as a biblical execution, it is still
<br>	   the season of good cheer, and we have all our Christmas treats:
<br>	   nuts, turkey and presents.
<br> 
<br>	[A ghastly high-pitched cackle pierces the air.]
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  [looking out the back window]  Oh! and my God-daughter, Millicent!
<br>	   [he takes picks up a pair of ear muffs]  Er, secure the ornaments,
<br>	   Mr Baldrick [he puts the ear muffs on], and let her in.
<br> 
<br>	   [while Baldrick is gone, he speaks to himself]
<br>	   So, we'll put all our presents under our little tree: A scarf
<br>	   for me, a pair of gloves for Mr Baldrick, and a hat for
<br>	   Millicent.
<br> 
<br>	    [Millicent cackles as she enters.  Baldrick comes in a short
<br>	     while later, with handkerchiefs stuffed in his ears.]
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Ah, Millicent!  To what do I owe this excellent pleasure?
<br> 
<br>Millicent:  Oh, I just thought I pop round, you know, just on the off chance.
<br>	    Well, you know, Christmas is a time traditionally connected with
<br>	    presents...
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  It is indeed, and, look: [picks up the hat] a lovely hat for my
<br>	   dear God-daughter.
<br> 
<br>Millicent:  [quickly snatching it from his hands]  Oh, thanks.  [looks at
<br>	    the items still on the table]  Oh! and look: [picking up things
<br>	    as she mentions them] a scarf and a pair of gloves to match!
<br>	    Well, that's not bad, I suppose.  [cackles]
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  [making sure his earmuffs remain in place]  Yes, jolly good.
<br> 
<br>Millicent:  I'm sorry I can't stop.  I thought perhaps I might come back
<br>	    tomorrow at >lunchtimeare< sweet!!!  [turns to leave]
<br>	    Thanks...  [cackles as she leaves]
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Bye!  [removing the earmuffs]  My, what a jolly young girl.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Yeah -- pity she nicked all the presents.
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Yes, but I thought you and I would be spoilt enough with the
<br>	   turkey and [picking up a bowl of nuts] this mountain of nuts
<br>	   we have.
<br> 
<br>	[The doorbell rings.]
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Well, peel my tangerines! This >is< [?]!
<br> 
<br>	[In the front room, Beadle enters, followed by three extremely fat
<br>	 orphan boys, whom he warns to stay behind him and not push.]
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  [from the back room]  Ah, Beadle! Charmed, honoured, and
<br>	   lovelied in every possible way!
<br> 
<br>	[Baldrick hides the turkey in his coat as Beadle and the orphans
<br>	 enter the back room.]
<br> 
<br>Beadle:  [to the shoving orphans, who all are trying to fit into the room]
<br>	 Get back!  [to Ebenezer]  Felicitous compliments of the gorging
<br>	 season to you, sir.  Peace on Earth, and fat tums to all men.
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Well, indeed, indeed... and what of your little orphan charges?
<br> 
<br>Beadle:  Well, I don't think I charges them enough, as a matter of fact.
<br>	 Luckily, you're here to cover up the shortfall, Mr Blackadder.
<br>	 They're looking forward to coming tomorrow, perhaps bringing
<br>	 a little surprise for you...
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Oh, surely not another totally unexpected rendition of
<br>	   `God Rest Ye Merry Mr Blackadder'...
<br> 
<br>Beadle:  Not for me to say, sir.  All I can say is that it's Christmas as
<br>	 usual, except, sadly, we've managed to polish off all our nuts
<br>	 before the big day... [he and the orphans all lean toward the bowl of
<br>	 nuts. Baldrick, behind the orphans, jumps up and down trying to see.]
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Oh, well, what luck!  As fate would have it, we have some.
<br>	   Here: help yourselves.  [the orphans all prepare to grab them]
<br> 
<br>Beadle:  [stopping them]  No, sir! No, sir, I couldn't possibly take them
<br>	 from you! Absolutely not!  [picks up the bowl]  Is this all, is it?
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Yes...
<br> 
<br>Beadle:  Well, it'll have to do, then!  [gives bowl to orphans, who scramble
<br>	 hungrily around it]  See you tomorrow!  [laughs as he and orphans
<br>	 leave]
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Well, what a jolly fellow!
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Looked like a fat git to me.
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Well, yes, Mr Baldrick, but you mustn't judge people from outward
<br>	   appearances.  Strip away the outer layers of a fat git, and,
<br>	   inside, you'll probably find a--
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  ...>thin< git.  Here; those orphans were a bit fat, too.
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Well, there's some truth there.  [goes to sit in fireside chair]
<br>	   Certainly, when I go and visit them, I do tend to remove all
<br>	   sharp objects for fear of bursting one of them and getting
<br>	   showered in two dozen semi-digested pies... But what of it?
<br>	   As long as they're happy...
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  [removes turkey from his coat, puts it on table]  Well, at least
<br>	   we've still got our turkey!  [goes over to Ebenezer]  And -- who
<br>	   knows? -- Christmas is a time for miracles, so, maybe, if we
<br>	   screw up our eyes really tight and pray to the big pink pixie
<br>	   in the sky, someone will come and reward us... come on!
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  [complying, reluctantly]  Oh, dear innocent Mr Baldrick...
<br> 
<br>	[After a short pause, the doorbell rings.]
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  See?
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Well, baste my steaming puddings!
<br> 
<br>	[He and Baldrick go into the front room.  Baldrick opens the door;
<br>	 Victoria and Albert are there, badly disguised.  The chair bearer
<br>	 also is there (sans chair). Sappy "good-news" music plays.]
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Ah, good evening, sir and madam.
<br> 
<br>Victoria:  Good evening.  We have come here on a mission to reward the
<br>	   virtuous this Christmas Eve.
<br> 
<br>	[Baldrick smiles.]
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Good heavens!  [looks at Baldrick, rather stunned]
<br> 
<br>Albert:  [not hiding his accent]  ...and we have heard many stories of your
<br>	 kindness and generosity.
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Oh, well, one tries...
<br> 
<br>Victoria:  So, please...
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Yes?
<br> 
<br>	[Sappy music stops suddenly.]
<br> 
<br>Victoria:  Give us ten pounds for the virtuous old lady next door.
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Ah, well, we'd love to oblige, but I'm afraid we haven't anything
<br>	   to give.
<br> 
<br>Albert:  Surely you must have something... What about a goose?
<br> 
<br>Victoria:  [slightly turned on]  Oh, >Albertdo< hang your sock out, Santa will be
<br>	   dead before he gets within a hundred yards of it!  Don't you
<br>	   have any other socks?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  I've got one other... [raises a leg]
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Oh, don't worry about it, my dear fellow.  Take one of mine
<br>	   from the linen cupboard.  I'm off to bed -- there's nothing
<br>	   else to stay up for.  Good night, Mr Baldrick.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  'night 'night.  Oh! By the way -- I forgot to mention: When you
<br>	   were out there...
<br> 
<br>	[the violin is now replaced with spooky noises]
<br> 
<br>	   ...there was this enormous ghostly creature coming here saying,
<br>	   "Beware! for, tonight, you shall receive a strange and terrible
<br>	   visitation!"
<br> 
<br>	[the spooky noises stop suddenly]
<br> 
<br>	   I just thought I'd mention it.
<br> 
<br>	[spooky noises start up again]
<br> 
<br>	   It come through the wall, it said its piece, and then it sodded off.
<br> 
<br>	[noises stop again]
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  [chuckles]  Oh, fine.  Goodnight, Mr Baldrick.  [he leaves into
<br>	   the stairway to his bedroom]
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  'night 'night.  [he goes to sleep in the chair]
<br> 
<br>	[Scene changes to Ebenezer's bedroom.  He is lying in bed, and is
<br>	 woken by someone saying a spooky "Woo!"  The door to the room falls
<br>	 in, as steam and green light comes through.  Also coming through
<br>	 is a large bearded man holding his hands out, wiggling his fingers
<br>	 spookily, saying the "Woo!"  He steps in and laughs deeply, and
<br>	 begins to thrust his arms about, then does more, quicker, "Woo!"
<br>	 noises, getting sillier.  Eventually, Ebenezer, rather unfazed,
<br>	 speaks to the man (`Spirit').]
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Can I help?
<br> 
<br>Spirit:  [speaks with Scottish dialect]  No thanks, no, no no...  I just
<br>	 popped in to say `hello'.  [shakes Ebenezer's hand]  Spirit of
<br>	 Christmas; how do you do.  Just doing my usual rounds, you know:
<br>	 a wee bit of haunting, getting misers to change their evil ways.
<br>	 But you're obviously such a good chap [pats Ebenezer on the knee],
<br>	 there'll be no need for any of that nonsense, so I'll just say
<br>	 `cheery-bye'.  Cheery-bye!  [turns to leave]
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Well, can I get you a cup of tea or anything?
<br> 
<br>Spirit:  You wouldn't have anything a wee bit more, er, medicinal...?
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Oh, I see...  I've only got some of Nurse McCready's Surgical
<br>	   Bruise Lotion.  [motions where it is]
<br> 
<br>Spirit:  [picks up bottle]  Oh, nothing but the best at this house, eh?
<br>	 [eagerly opens it, sits `backward' in the chair next to a mirror
<br>	 and dresser, begins drinking]  Mmm! Delicious.  Well, this is a
<br>	 nice change from all those skinflints.  You know that old fellow
<br>	 down the road?  Bags of money!  I caught him trying to cut down on
<br>	 his heating bills by using his John Thomas as a draught excluder!
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Oh, dear... old people today, eh?  Tell me: How do you get them
<br>	   to change their ways?
<br> 
<br>Spirit:  Well, it's all visions these days.  We used to use black-and-white
<br>	 line drawings, but the visions are more effective.
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Well, what sort of thing?
<br> 
<br>Spirit:  Well, it depends, really.  With some people, it's just a glimpse
<br>	 of their behaviour at school behind the pennyfarthing sheds...
<br>	 Er, some other people, well, we just show them how rotten their
<br>	 ancestors were.  Of course, with >your< ancestors, it would have
<br>	 to be the full one-hour-ten vision with a break and ice cream.
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Oh, dear! That bad, were they?
<br> 
<br>Spirit:  Och -- did nobody tell ye?  Stinkers to men!  Oh, perhaps you'd like
<br>	 to see...  [waves his free hand about and twiddles his tongue]
<br> 
<br>	[Scene changes to Elizabethan England.  Lord Edmund Blackadder looks
<br>	 very bored at his servant, Baldrick, who is offering him a Christmas
<br>	 cracker.  They are just outside the throne room.]
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Come on, My Lord!  Give it a little pull!  You know you want to!
<br>	   It'll be ever so exciting!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [gives in]  Oh, God...  [he pulls the cracker as Baldrick winces
<br>	 in anticipation of the crack, but there's only a little squeak]
<br>	 Yes -- terrifying.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  And, look, there's a surprise present for you inside.  It's a
<br>	   novelty death warrant, and you give it to a friend.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Oh, just what I've always wanted.  [crumples it]
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Have you got anything for me?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Oh, it's nothing, really.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  [charmed]  Oh, Sir...
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  No, it's really nothing.  I haven't got anything for you.
<br>	 [walks to a large curtained object]  I spent all my cash on this
<br>	 damn thing for the Queen.  [pulls the curtains open, to reveal a
<br>	 portrait of the Queen]  She'd better she'll bloody like it -- she
<br>	 dropped enough hints.  [shuts the curtains]  Gah, that woman's about
<br>	 as subtle as a rhinocerous horn up the backside.  [lifts the
<br>	 portrait]  Door.
<br> 
<br>	[Inside, Queen Elizabeth I and Nursie are tearing apart coloured-
<br>	 paper chains.  Edmund enters, carrying the curtained portrait.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Good morning, Your Majesty.  Christmas again, eh?  What joy.
<br>	 [puts the portrait down]  Don't you just love it?
<br> 
<br>Elizabeth:  No -- I hate it!  In fact, I've just abolished it.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  I'm sorry...?
<br> 
<br>Elizabeth:  I ought to block up the chimneys, burn all the crackers, and kill 
<br>	    anyone I see carrying a present.  [looks at the portrait]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Oh.  [lifts the portrait and prepares to leave]
<br> 
<br>Elizabeth:  [points at portrait, speaks demandingly]  What's that, Edmund?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  This? ... It's a window...
<br> 
<br>Elizabeth:  A window?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Yes, but you seem to have one here, so, sorry to disturb you...
<br>	 [exits, leaving her baffled (Nursie just grins brainlessly)]
<br> 
<br>	[Outside, Edmund hands the portrait to Baldrick, who holds it from the
<br>	 bottom, so it covers his face.  Edmund closes the door, and pulls
<br>	 open the portrait's curtains.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Well, so much for that.  [punches the Queen's face in the portrait;
<br>	 his hand goes through the canvas and hits Baldrick's face.  He then
<br>	 motions to Lord Melchett, who approaches]  Ah, Melchett!  Greetings!
<br>	 I trust that Christmas brings you its traditional mix of good food
<br>	 and violent stomach cramp.
<br> 
<br>Melchett:  ...and compliments of the season to >youlove< presents!
<br> 
<br>	[Edmund rolls his eyes, unhappy about the Queen's wishy-washiness.]
<br> 
<br>Elizabeth:  [to Melchett]  You know, for a moment I took against Christmas,
<br>	    but I'm completely dippy about it again.  In fact, I'd like to
<br>	    marry you!  ...if you weren't as unattractive as a giant slug!
<br> 
<br>Melchett:  [laughing]  Oh, pish, Majesty!
<br> 
<br>Elizabeth:  But, anyway, to reward you, I'm going to give you >lots< of
<br>	    presents!  Um, fancy a castle?
<br> 
<br>Melchett:  Well, Windsor, Majesty...
<br> 
<br>Elizabeth:  ...title?
<br> 
<br>Melchett:  Duke of Kent?
<br> 
<br>Elizabeth:  ...anything else?
<br> 
<br>Melchett:  Well, a devilish saucy wife would be fun.
<br> 
<br>Elizabeth:  [thinks]  Lady Jane Pottle!
<br> 
<br>Melchett:  Oh, yummy!
<br> 
<br>Elizabeth:  I think she's Blackadder's girl at the moment, but that doesn't
<br>	    matter, does it, Blacky...
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  No, of course not, Ma'am... and perhaps Lord Melchett would like
<br>	 to whip me naked through the streets of Aberdeen...
<br> 
<br>Melchett:  Oh, I don't think we need go that far, Blackadder...
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Oh, too kind...
<br> 
<br>Melchett:  No -- Aylesbury's quite far enough.
<br> 
<br>Elizabeth:  Super.  Well done, Melchy.  And, now, Blackadder, what have
<br>	    you got me?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Erm...
<br> 
<br>Elizabeth:  I WANT A PREZZY!!!  Give me something nice and shiny; and if
<br>	    you don't, I've got something nice and shiny for you, and it's
<br>	    called an axe!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Erm, well, well... [looks down at his person hoping to find
<br>	 something]
<br> 
<br>Elizabeth:  Right! That's it.  Any last requests, Blackadder, before I chop
<br>	    your block off and put it on top of the crimble tree?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [still searching his person, comes across the novelty death warrant]
<br>	 Er, well, there is one, actually, Ma'am: You know how much I've
<br>	 always been a great admirer [motions his hand to and fro between she
<br>	 and Melchett] of you both -- I was wondering if I could just have
<br>	 your autographs, erm, to keep me company during the final, tragic,
<br>	 lonely hours...  [he already has handed her a quill]
<br> 
<br>Elizabeth:  Oh, all right.  [signs]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Ah, there.  Thank you, Ma'am.  [moves to Melchett]  And, Lord
<br>	 Melchett [gives him the quill]...just there... [Melchett signs]
<br>	 Thank-- [looks astonished]  Oh! Dear me!
<br> 
<br>Elizabeth:  What is it?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Why, this piece of paper that Your Majesty has just signed turns out
<br>	 to be some sort of death warrant!
<br> 
<br>Elizabeth:  Oops.  ...and I can't go back on it without destroying the whole
<br>	    basis of the British Constitution...
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  I fear not!
<br> 
<br>Elizabeth:  Is there a name on it?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Well, yes, there is, actually... It says, "Lord"... er, I can't
<br>	 read this terrible childish writing... er, "Lord...Mel...chett" ...
<br>	 "Lord Melchett"; that's it.
<br> 
<br>Melchett:  [trying to grab the paper from Edmund]  Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am!
<br>	   It's a trick!  You've been tricked!
<br> 
<br>Elizabeth:  Oh, good!  Christmas is a time for tricks and japes and larks
<br>	    of all kinds.  Tell you what, Blackadder: that's so brilliant,
<br>	    I'll execute Melchett instead!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  You're very kind, Ma'am.
<br> 
<br>	[Nursie looks at Melchett and laughs maniacally]
<br> 
<br>Elizabeth:  ...and I suppose that means that everything of Lord Melchett's
<br>	    becomes yours.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  I suppose it does.  [he presents a hand to Melchett and snaps his
<br>	 fingers; Melchett gives him the crown; he gives the crown to
<br>	 Elizabeth, who is delighted]  Merry Christmas, Ma'am...
<br> 
<br>	[Scene changes back to Ebenezer's bedroom.]
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  [with a slight grin]  Good lord!
<br> 
<br>Spirit:  Horrible, eh?  [stands, goes to the bedside]  What a pig!
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Yes, although clearly quite a clever, charming pig.  [Spirit is
<br>	   shocked]  But, no, as you say, his behaviour...disgraceful.
<br> 
<br>Spirit:  Ah, you're a great improvement on them all.  [pats Ebenezer's
<br>	 knees again]  You're a good boy...
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  `Them'?  Are there more?
<br> 
<br>Spirit:  Oh, yes!  Have a shufti at this!  [waves his arm and makes
<br>	 "Woo!" noise]
<br> 
<br>	[Scene changes to Regency England.  Edmund Blackadder, butler to
<br>	 the Prince Regent, enters the vestibule outside the Prince's
<br>	 quarters with his own servant, Baldrick.  He is carrying a red
<br>	 sack.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Right, Balders... [puts sack on a chair]  I'm sick of getting
<br>	 no presents and the Prince Regent getting the lot, so this is
<br>	 the plan: We play our traditional game of charades, and, when
<br>	 he gets bored and asks for a story, you come out here [lifts
<br>	 the sack up a bit], stick the dress and the hat on, and then
<br>	 knock on the door.  I'll take it from there.  Have you got it?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Got it...
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Yes, well, you certainly will get it if you mess this up.
<br> 
<br>	[Inside, Prince George tries to wake Lord Horatio Nelson, who sits
<br>	 in a chair, holding a drink in his left (and only) hand, with an
<br>	 eyepatch over his left eye.  Edmund and Baldrick enter.]
<br> 
<br>Prince:  Ah, hurrah!  Welcome, lads!  Oh, this is the stuff, eh? Christmas
<br>	 sherry and charades with honest manly fellows.  I mean, for
<br>	 Heaven's sake, what can I do with a girl that I can't do with
<br>	 you, eh?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  I cannot conceive, Sir.
<br> 
<br>Prince:  Yes, well, there's that, I suppose.  Now; who's first up for the
<br>	 game?  I'd ask old Horatio here, but he's out of it, I'm afraid;
<br>	 so it's, er [points at Baldrick], what, it's the little monkey
<br>	 fellow first, then, is it?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  It is indeed, Sir.
<br> 
<br>Prince:  Ah, excellent!  Oh, I love charades... [goes over to sit in a chair]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  OK, off you go, Baldrick.
<br> 
<br>	[Baldrick steps in front of them, then opens his arms like a book.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  It's a book...
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Well done, Mr B!  I didn't think you'd get it >that< quickly.
<br> 
<br>Prince:  Well, I must say, Bladder, that was damn clever!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Yes, another great Christmas tradition: explaining the rules eight
<br>	 times to the Thicky Twins.  The round hasn't in fact started yet.
<br>	 It's got to be a specific book.  For instance, if it was The Bible,
<br>	 I would go like that [holding up two fingers] to indicate that there
<br>	 are two syllables in it...
<br> 
<br>Prince:  Two what?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Two syllables.
<br> 
<br>Prince:  Two silly bulls?  I don't think so, Blackadder -- not in The Bible.
<br>	 I can remember a fatted calf, but, as I recall, that was quite a
<br>	 sensible animal.  Oh, ah! It's it, um, er, Noah's Ark, with the, er,
<br>	 two pigs, two ants, and two silly bulls?  Is that it?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Two syll>aanamed

<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Don't be ludicrous, Baldrick -- what would the Queen be doing
<br>	   here?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Well, she'd come to visit you to reward you for being the nicest
<br>	   man in England, by giving you fifty thousand pounds and the title
<br>	   of Baron Blackadder.
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Baldrick, it couldn't have been the Queen; because, when she
<br>	   visits people, she leaves them her Royal Seal.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  What, like this one?  [takes seal out of a pocket]
<br> 
<br>Ebenezer:  Yes, just like tha--  [he stares at it in disbelief]
