The hustings are <br>   over, the bunting is down, the mad hysteria is at an end. After the <br>   chaos of a general election, we can return to normal.<br> <br>M: Oh, has there been a general election, then, Mr. Blackadder?<br> <br>E: Indeed there has, Mrs. Miggins.<br> <br>M: Oh, well, I never heard about it.<br> <br>E: Well of course you didn't; you're not eligible to vote.<br> <br>M: Well, why not?<br> <br>E: Because virtually no-one is: women, peasants, (looks at Baldrick)<br>   chimpanzees (Baldrick looks behind himself, trying to see the animal),<br>   lunatics, Lords...<br> <br>B: That's not true -- Lord Nelson's got a vote!<br> <br>E: He's got a *boat*, Baldrick. Marvelous thing, democracy. Look at <br>   Manchester: population, 60,000; electoral roll, 3.<br> <br>M: Well, I may have the brain the size of a sultana(sp?)...<br> <br>E: Correct...<br> <br>M: ...but it hardly seems fair to me.<br> <br>E: Of course it's not fair -- and a damn good thing too. Give the like of <br>   Baldrick the vote and we'll be back to cavorting druids, death by<br>   stoning, and dung for dinner.<br> <br>B: Oh, I'm having dung for dinner tonight.<br> <br>M: So, who are they electing when they have these elections?<br> <br>E: Ah, the same old (?): fat tory landowners who get made MPs when <br>   they reach a certain weight; raving revolutionaries who think that just<br>   because they do a day's work that somehow gives them the right to get <br>   paid... Basically, it's a right old mess. Toffs at the top, plebs at the<br>   bottom, and me in the middle making a fat pile of cash out of both of them.<br> <br>M: Oh, you'd better watch out, Mr. Blackadder; things are bound to change.<br> <br>E: Not while Pitt the Elder's Prime Minister they aren't. He's about as <br>   effective as a catflap in an elephant house. As long as his feet are warm<br>   and he gets a nice cup of milky tea in the sun before his morning nap,<br>   he doesn't bother anyone until his potty needs emptying.<br> <br> <br>In the House of Commons (occasionally, sheep are heard in the background)<br> <br>(a voice, the Speaker)<br> <br>S: Honourable members of the House of Commons, I call upon the new Prime <br>   Minister of Great Britain and Her Empires: Mr. William Pitt, the Younger. <br> <br>P: Mr. Speaker, members of the House: I shall be brief, as I have, rather<br>   unfortunately, become Prime Minister right in the middle of my exams.<br>   I look forward to fulfilling my duty in a manner of which Nanny would<br>   be proud. I shall introduce legislation to utterly destory three enemies <br>   of the State. The first is that evil dictator, Napoleon Bonaparte.<br> <br>(Members shout `Here here!!')<br> <br>P: The second is my old Geography master, (Benonabreast Switchanks?).<br>   But most of all, sirs, I intend to pursue that utter slob, The Prince of<br>   Wales! Why, this year alone, he has spent 15,000 pounds on banqueting <br>   (shouts of `boo! boo!'), 20,000 pounds on perfume (members all hold their<br>   noses), and -- most astonishing of all -- an astonishing 59,000 pounds on<br>   socks! Therefore, my three main policy priorities are: 1) War with France;<br>   2) Tougher sentences for geography teachers; and 3) A right royal kick of<br>   the Prince's backside!!<br> <br>(all members shout affirmatively)<br> <br>P: I now put upon the leader of the Opposition to test me on my Latin vocab.<br> <br> <br>At Prince's House<br> <br>E: Sir, if I may make so bold, a major crisis has arisen in your affairs.<br> <br>G: Yes, I know, Blackadder. I've been pondering it all morning.<br> <br>E: You have, sir?<br> <br>G: Yes -- socks! Run out again!! Why is it that no matter how many millions of<br>   pairs of socks I buy, I never seem to have any?<br> <br>E: Sir, with your forgiveness, there is another, even weightier, problem.<br> <br>G: They just...disappear! Honestly, you'd think someone was coming in here,<br>   stealing the damn things and then selling them off.<br> <br>E: (laughs) Impossible, sir. Only you and I have access to your socks.<br> <br>G: Yes, yes, you're right. Still; for me, socks are like sex: tons of it<br>   about, and I never seem to get any.<br> <br>E: Now, if I may return to this very urgent matter... I read fearful news in<br>   this morning's paper.<br> <br>G: Oh no... Not another little cat caught up in a tree...<br> <br>E: No, sir. There's a vote afoot in the new Parliament to strike you from the<br>   Civil List.<br> <br>G: Oh, yes, yes, yes, but what are they going to do about my socks!<br> <br>E: Sir, if this bill goes through, you won't have any socks.<br> <br>G: Well, I haven't got any socks at the moment!<br> <br>E: ...or trousers, shirts, waistcoats, or pantaloons. They're going to <br>   bankrupt you.<br> <br>G: Well, they can't do that. Why, the public love me! Only the other day, I<br>   was out in the street and they sang, `We hail Prince George! We hail Prince<br>   George!'<br> <br>E: `We *hate* Prince George', sir. `We *hate* Prince George!'<br> <br>G: Was it?<br> <br>E: I fear so, sir. However, all is not lost. Fortunately, the numbers in the<br>   Commons are exactly equal. If we can get one more MP to support us, then<br>   you're safe.<br> <br>G: Well, hurrah! Any ideas?<br> <br>E: Well, yes, sir. There is one man who might be the ace up our sleeve. A <br>   rather crusty, loudmouthed ace named Sir Talbot Buxomly.<br> <br>G: Never heard of him.<br> <br>E: That's hardly surprising, sir. Sir Talbot has the worst attendence record<br>   of any member of Parliament. On the one occasion he did enter the House of<br>   Commons, he passed water in the Great Hall, and then passed *out* in the<br>   Speaker's Chair. But if we can get him to support us, then we are safe.<br> <br>G: Well, what's he like?<br> <br>E: Well, according to `Who's Who', his interests include flogging servants,<br>   shooting poor people, and the extension of slavery to anyone who hasn't<br>   got a knighthood.<br> <br>G: Excellent! Sensible policies for a happier Britain!<br> <br>E: However, if we are to get him to support us, he will need some sort of<br>   incentive.<br> <br>G: Hmm. Anything in mind?<br> <br>E: Well, you could appoint him a High Court judge...<br> <br>G: Is he qualified?<br> <br>E: He's a violent, bigoted, mindless old fool.<br> <br>G: Sounds a bit *over*qualified... Well, send him here at once!<br> <br>E: Certainly, sir. I will return before you can say `antidisestablishment-<br>   arianism'.<br> <br>G: Well, I wouldn't be too sure about that! `Antidistibblincemin...'<br>   `Antimistilinstid...'  `Antistits...'<br> <br>(Caption: Two Days Later)<br> <br>G: Anti-distinctly-minty-(???)...<br> <br>E: (returns with Buxomly, who staggers)<br>   Your Highness: Sir Talbot Buxomly, MP.<br> <br>G: Ah, Buxomly! Roaringly splendid to have you here. How are you, sir?<br> <br>T: Heartily well, Your Highness. I dined hugely off of servants before <br>   I come into town.<br> <br>G: Um, you eat your servants?<br> <br>T: No, sir -- I eat *off* them. Why should I spend good money on tables when<br>   I have men standing idle?<br> <br>G: Why, indeed! Now; I dare say you've heard of Mr. Pitt's intentions...<br> <br>T: Young scallywag!<br> <br>G: Ah, so you don't approve of his plans to abolish me, then.<br> <br>T: I do not, sir. Damn his eyes! Damn his britches! Damn his duck pond!<br> <br>G: Well, hurrah for that!<br> <br>T: I care not a jot that you are the son of a certified sauerkraut-sucking<br>   loon!<br> <br>G: Ah, thank you, sir.<br> <br>T: It minds not me that you dress like a mad parrot and talk like a plate of<br>   beans negotiating their way out of a cow's digestive system. It is no<br>   skin off my rosy nose that there are bits of lemon peel floating down the<br>   Thames that would make better Regents than you.<br> <br>G: Well, bravo!<br> <br>T: The fact is, you *are* Regent...<br> <br>G: Yes, I am...<br> <br>T: ...appointed by God, and I shall stick by you forever, though infirmity<br>   lay me waste and ill health curse my every waking moment. (falls into the<br>   chair)<br> <br>G: Ah, good on you, sir. And don't talk to me about infirmity. Why, sir, you<br>   are the hardy stock that is the core of Britain's greatness. You have the<br>   physique of a demigod. Purple of cheek, and plump of fatlock, the shapely<br>   ankle and the well-filled trouser that tells of a human body in perfect<br>   working order.<br> <br>E: (who has found T's stillness rather odd and is checking for a pulse)<br>   He's dead, sir.<br> <br>G: Dead?<br> <br>E: Yes, Your Highness.<br> <br>G: Oh, what bad luck; we were rather getting on.<br> <br>E: We must move at once.<br> <br>G: In which direction?<br> <br>E: Sir Talbot represented the constituency of Dunny-on-the-Wold, and, by <br>   an extraordinary stroke of luck, it is a rotten borough.<br> <br>G: Really! Is it! Well, lucky-lucky us. Lucky-lucky-luck.<br>   (as a chicken) Luck-luck-LAKK-LAKK-LAKK-LAKK-cluck-cluck-cluck-cluck-<br>   cluck-LAKK-LAKK-LAKK.<br> <br>E: You don't know what a rotten borough is, do you, sir.<br> <br>G: No.<br> <br>E: So what was the chicken impression in aid of?<br> <br>G: Well, I just didn't want to hurt your feelings. Erm, so, what is a robber<br>   button?<br> <br>E: *Rotten borough*.<br> <br>G: Oh, yes, you're right.<br> <br>E: A rotten borough, sir, is a constituency where the owner<br>   of the land corruptly controls the both the voters and the MP.<br> <br>G: Good, yes...and a robber button is...?<br> <br>E: Could we leave that for a moment? Dunny-on-the-Wold is a tuppenny-<br>   ha'penny place. Half an acre of sodden marshland in the Suffolk Fens<br>   with an empty town hall on it. Population: three rather mangy cows, a<br>   dachshund named `Colin', and a small hen in its late forties.<br> <br>G: So, no people at all, then? apart from Colin...<br> <br>E: Colin is a dog, sir.<br> <br>G: Well, yes, yes, yes...<br> <br>E: Only one actual person lives there, and he is the voter.<br> <br>G: Well, right! So, what's the plan?<br> <br>E: We must buy Dunny-on-the-Wold at once and thus control the voter. I shall<br>   need a thousand pounds.<br> <br>G: A thousand pounds? I thought you said it was a...`tuppenny ha'penny' place.<br> <br>E: Well, yes, sir, the land will cost tuppence-ha'penny, but there are<br>   many other factors to be considered: (stamp?) duty, window tax, swamp<br>   insurance, hen food, dog biscuits, cow (ointment?) -- the expenses are<br>   endless.<br> <br>G: Fine. Well, the money's in my desk.<br> <br>E: No, sir -- it's in my wallet.<br> <br>G: Oh, splendid! No time to lose, eh? <br> <br>E: My thoughts presicely, sir. The only question is who to choose as MP.<br> <br>G: Yeah, tricky.<br> <br>E: What we need is an utter unknown yet someone over whom we have complete<br>   power. A man with no mind, with no ideas of his own. One might almost<br>   say a man with no brain.  (he rings the servant bell)<br> <br>G: Well...any thoughts?<br> <br>E: Yes, Your Highness.<br> <br>(Baldrick enters)<br> <br>B: You rang, My Lord?<br> <br>E: (to George) Meet the new member of Parliament for Dunny-on-the-Wold.<br> <br>G: But he's an absolute arsehead!<br> <br>E: Precisely, sir. Our slogan shall be: "A rotten candidate for a rotten<br>   borough." Baldrick, I want you to go back to your kitchen sink, you see,<br>   and prepare for government.<br> <br> <br>At Baldrick's/Blackadder's Quarters<br> <br>E: Right. Now all we have to do is fill in this MP application form. Name:<br>   `Baldrick'. First name...?<br> <br>B: Er, I'm not sure.<br> <br>E: Well, you must have some idea...<br> <br>B: Well, it might be `Sod off'.<br> <br>E: What?<br> <br>B: Well, when I used to play in the gutter, I used to say to the other<br>   snipes, "Hello, my name's Baldrick," and they'd say, "Yes, we know.<br>   Sod off, Baldrick."<br> <br>E: All right, right right right right, `Mr. S. Baldrick'. Now; distinguishing<br>   features... `None'.<br> <br>B: Well, I've got this big growth in the middle of my face.<br> <br>E: That's your nose, Baldrick. Now; any history of insanity in the family?<br>   Tell you what, I'll cross out the `in'. Any history of *sanity* in the<br>   family? `None whatsoever'. Now then; criminal record...<br> <br>B: Absolutely not.<br> <br>E: Oh, come on, Baldrick, you're going to be an MP, for God's sake! I'll just<br>   put `fraud and sexual deviancy'. Now; minimum bribe level...<br> <br>B: One turnip. Oh, hang on, I don't want to price myself out of the market.<br> <br>E: Baldrick, I've always been meaning to ask: Do you have any ambitions in <br>   life apart from the aquisition of turnips?<br> <br>B: Er, no.<br> <br>E: So what would you do if I gave you a thousand pounds?<br> <br>B: I'd get a little turnip of my own.<br> <br>E: So what would you do if I gave you a million pounds?<br> <br>B: Oh, that's different. I'd get a great big turnip in the country.<br> <br>(someone knocks at the door)<br> <br>E: Oh God, I'll get that. Here (pushes paper to Baldrick), sign here.<br>   (motions where with his hand; Baldrick marks an `X' on Edmund's palm;<br>   Edmund presses his palm against the application.)<br> <br> <br>At Prince's House<br> <br>E: Your Highness; Pitt the Younger.<br> <br>G: Why, hello there, young sabre, m'lad! I say, here's one: I've a shiny<br>   sixpence here and for the clever fellow who can tell me which hand it's<br>   in.<br> <br>(Pitt just stares.)<br> <br>G: Hmm? Oh, school, school! On half hols, is it? Yeah, I bet you can't wait<br>   to get back and get that bat in your hand and give those balls a good<br>   walloping, eh?<br> <br>E: Mr. Pitt is the Prime Minister, sir.<br> <br>G: Oh, go on! Is he? What, young Snotty here?<br> <br>P: I'd rather have a runny nose than a runny brain.<br> <br>G: Eh?<br> <br>E: Umm, excuse me, Prime Minister, but we do have some lovely jelly in the<br>   pantry, I don't know if you'd be interested at all...?<br> <br>P: Don't patronise me, you lower middle class yobbo! (aside) What flavour<br>   is it?<br> <br>E: Blackcurrant.<br> <br>P: eeeeuuuuuaaaghhhh!<br> <br>G: I say, Blackadder, are you sure this is the PM? Seems like a bit of an<br>   oily tick to me. When I was at school, we used to line up four or five<br>   of his sort, make them bend over, and use them as a toastrack.<br> <br>P: You don't surprise me, sir -- I know your sort. Once, it was I who stood<br>   in the big, cold schoolroom, a hot crumpet burning my cheeks with shame.<br>   Since that day, I have been busy, every hour God sends, working to become<br>   Prime Minister and fight sloth and privilege wherever I found it.<br> <br>E: I trust you weren't too busy to remove the crumpet...<br> <br>P: You will regret this, gentlemen. You think you can thwart my plans to bank-<br>   rupt the Prince by fixing the Dunny-on-the-Wold bye-election, but you will<br>   be thrashed! I intend to put up my own brother as a candidate against you.<br> <br>E: Oh, and which Pitt would this be: Pitt the Toddler? Pitt the Embryo? Pitt<br>   the Glint in the Milkman's Eye?<br> <br>P: Sirs, as I said to Chancellor (Messenec?) at the Congress of Strasbourg:<br>   `Pooh to you with knobs on!' We shall meet, sirs, on the hustings. (exits)<br> <br>G: I say, Blackadder, what a ghastly (squit?)! He's not going to win, is he?<br> <br>E: No, sir, because, firstly, we shall fight this campaign on issues, not <br>   personalities. Secondly, we shall be the only fresh thing on the menu. And<br>   thirdly, of course, we'll cheat.<br> <br> <br>At the Election Polls<br>(announcer, Vincent Hanna, speaks)<br> <br>H: Good evening and welcome to the Dunny-on-the-Wold bye-election. The first<br>   thing I must tell you is that the turnout has been very good. As a matter<br>   of fact, the voter turned out before breakfast. And I can bring you the<br>   result of our exculsive exit poll, which produced a 100-percent result for<br>   "Mind-Your-Own-Business-You-Nosy-Bastard."<br> <br>(a voice shouts out): Mr. Hanna, are you going to talk to any of the<br>                      candidates?<br> <br>H: I certainly am, and I can see Prince George, who is leader of what has<br>   become known as the `Adder Party'; Prince George, who is described in his<br>   party news sheet as a "great moral and spiritual leader of the nation," but <br>   is described by almost everyone else as a "fat, flatulent git." (to George)<br>   Prince George, hello.<br> <br>G: (holding a dachshund) Good evening.<br> <br>H: ...and good evening, Colin.  Er, how do you see your prospects in this<br>   campaign?<br> <br>G: Well, er, first, I'd like a word about the disgraceful circumstances in <br>   which this election arose. We paid for this seat, and I think it's a damn <br>   liberty that we should have to stand for it as well. And another thing, why<br>   is it that no matter how many pairs of socks a man buys, he never seems to<br>   have enough?  (leaves)<br> <br>H: (Fitting?) words from the Prince Regent. And now let's have a word from<br>   the Adder Party candidate, Mr. S. Baldrick, who so far has not (Baldrick<br>   enters with a turnip in his mouth, the leaves sticking out) commented on<br>   his policies in this campaign, but with him is his election agent, Mr. E.<br>   Blackadder.<br> <br>E: Well, we in the Adder Party are going to fight this campaign on issues,<br>   not personalities.<br> <br>H: Why is that?<br> <br>E: Because our candidate doesn't have a personality.<br> <br>H: He doesn't say much about the issues, either.<br> <br>E: No; he's got something wrong with his throat.<br> <br>H: Well, perhaps he could answer one question: What does the `S' in his name <br>   stand for?<br> <br>E: `Sod off'. (leaves)<br> <br>H: Fair enough, er, none of my business, really. And now it's time, I think,<br>   for a result, and tension is running very high here. Mr. Blackadder assures<br>   me that this will be the first honest vote ever in a rotten borough. And I<br>   think we all hope for a result which reflects the real needs of the<br>   constituency. And behind me...yes, I can just see the Returning Officer<br>   moving to the front of the platform. <br> <br>E: As the Acting Returning Officer of Dunny-on-the-Wold...<br> <br>H: (cuts in) Er, the Acting Returning Officer, Mr. E. Blackadder, of course.<br>   And we're all very grateful, indeed, that he stepped in at the last minute,<br>   when the previous Returning Officer accidently brutally stabbed himself<br>   in the stomach while shaving.<br> <br>E: I now announce the number of votes cast as follows: Brigadier General <br>   Horace Bolsom...<br> <br>H: (cuts) Cheap-Royalty-White-Rat-Catching-And-Safe-Sewage Residents Party...<br> <br>E: No votes.<br> <br>(Bolsom pushes his way off platform)<br> <br>E: Ivor `Jest-ye-not-madam' Biggun...<br> <br>H: (cuts) Standing-At-The-Back-Dressed-Stupidly-And-Looking-Stupid Party...<br> <br>E: No votes.<br> <br>(Ivor laughs, plays a bazooka (kazoo) in E's ear, laughs more and waves)<br> <br>E: Pitt, the Even Younger...<br> <br>H: (cuts) Whig...<br> <br>E: No votes.<br> <br>H: Oh, there's a shock.<br> <br>(Pitt the Even Younger turns to his mum and cries)<br> <br>E: Mr. S. Baldrick...<br> <br>H: (cuts) Adder Party...<br> <br>E: Sixteen thousand, four hundred, and seventy-two.<br> <br>(Cheers are heard.)<br> <br>H: And there you have it: victory for the Adder Party -- a sensational swing<br>   against the Whigs. I'll just try to get a final word from some of the<br>   candidates as they come up from the stage. Master William Pitt the Even<br>   Younger, are you disappointed?<br> <br>P (the Even Younger): (stomps on) Yes! I'm horrified! I smeared my opponent,<br>  bribed the press to be on my side, and threatened to torture the electorate<br>  if we lost. I fail to see what more a decent politician could have done.<br>  (stomps off)<br> <br>H: Quite. Now; Ivor Biggun, no votes at all for the Standing-At-The-Back-<br>   Dressed-Stupidly-And-Looking-Stupid Party. Are you disappointed?<br> <br>I: Ah, no, not really, no... I always say, "If you can't laugh, what *can*<br>   you do?" Ha-ha-ha-ha (squirts Hanna with flower).<br> <br>H: ...take up politics, perhaps. Has your party got any policies?<br> <br>I: Oh yes, certainly! We're for the compulsory serving of asparagus at break-<br>   fast, free corsets for the under-fives, and the abolition of slavery.<br> <br>H: Now, you see, many moderate people would respect your stand on asparagus,<br>   but what about this extremist nonsense about abolishing slavery?<br> <br>I: Oh, we just put that in for a joke! See you next year!<br> <br>H: And now, finally, a word with the man who is at the centre of this bye-<br>   election mystery: the voter himself. And his name is Mr. E. Bla--<br>   Mr. Blackadder, *you* are the only voter in this rotten borough...?<br> <br>E: Yes, that's right.<br> <br>H: How long have you lived in this constituency?<br> <br>E: Since Wednesday morning. I took over the previous electorate when he, very<br>   sadly, accidently brutally cut his head off while combing his hair.<br> <br>H: One voter, 16,472 votes -- a slight anomaly...?<br> <br>E: Not really, Mr. Hanna. You see, Baldrick may look like a monkey who's<br>   been put in a suit and then strategically shaved, but he is a brillant<br>   politician. The number of votes I cast is simply a reflection of how<br>   firmly I believe in his policies.<br> <br>H: Well, that's excellent. Er, well, that's all for me -- another great day<br>   for democracy in our country. Vincent Hanna; Country Gentleman's Pig<br>   Fertilizer Gazette; Dunny-on-the-Wold.<br> <br> <br>At Baldrick/Blackadder's Quarters <br> <br>E: Your reprieve (puts something on table). It is a triumph for stupidity<br>   over common sense.<br> <br>B: Thank you very much.<br> <br>E: As a reward, Baldrick, take a short holiday... Did you enjoy it?<br>   Right; on your way.<br> <br> <br>At House of Commons<br> <br>(Baldrick is wearing a powdered wig, with his natural hair sticking out from<br>beneath)<br> <br>Speaker: Will the honourable Members please cast their votes, `aye' or `nay',<br>         for the striking of the Prince Regent off the Civil List.<br> <br>B: (perplexed) Er, excuse me, excuse me (all others walk away to vote), er...<br>   EXCUSE ME!<br> <br>P: (appears from behind Baldrick's pew) Hello, chappie... You a new bug?<br> <br>B: Yeah, I don't know anyone here, and I support the Prince and I don't know<br>   how to vote!<br> <br>P: Well, we can soon change all of that, can't we? Come along with me...<br> <br>B: Oh, thanks.<br> <br> <br>At Prince's House<br> <br>(a knock at the door; Edmund opens it to find Pitt the Younger.)<br> <br>E: Well, well, well: if it isn't the Lord Privy Toastrack! Pull up a muffin;<br>   sit yourself down.<br> <br>P: You don't like me, do you, Mr. Blackadder?<br> <br>E: Well, nobody likes a loser.<br> <br>P: Oh, then that's why nobody likes *you*.<br> <br>E: (serious) What?<br> <br>P: You lost the vote. Your monkey obligingly voted for us.<br> <br>E: Oh God, no... If you want something done properly, kill Baldrick before<br>   you start.<br> <br>P: You're beaten, Oik! And you and your disgusting master have twenty-four <br>   hours to get out.<br> <br>E: Twenty-four hours is a long time in politics. Good day.<br> <br>P: There is just one thing before I go... (confidentially) I've got this<br>   sort of downy hair developing on my chest -- is that normal? Also, I get<br>   so lonely and confused. I've written a poem about it; maybe you'll under-<br>   stand. "Why do nice girls hate me? Why--<br> <br>E: Get out, you nausating adolescent! (shoos him out the door) Piss off!<br> <br> <br> <br>At Mrs. Miggins' home<br> <br>(Baldrick is tied to a spit; Mrs. Miggins turns it.)<br> <br>E: How could I have been so stupid? Goodbye, Millionaire's Row; Hello, Room 12<br>   of the (Budley-Sortiton?) Twilight Rest Home for the Terminally Short<br>   of Cash!<br> <br>M: ...and to think you once dreamed you'd end up in the House of Lords.<br> <br>E: What?<br> <br>M: The House of Lords.<br> <br>E: Of course! I'd forgotten about the House of Lords! The Lords will never<br>   let the bill through. Every man-jack of them will be behind the Prince.<br> <br>M: Oh, hurrah!<br> <br>E: Right, take Baldrick off the spit.<br> <br>B: Hurrah...<br> <br>E: I've got a plan so cunning you could put a tail on it and call it a weasel.<br> <br> <br>(Sometime later, in Prince's House)<br> <br>E: Da-daa!<br> <br>G: (looking through a telescope) Oi, tallyho, Blackadder! You look as happy<br>   as a man who thought a cat had done its business on his pie, but it turned<br>   out to be an extra big blackberry. Did our plan go well?<br> <br>E: Excellently, sir. Order a thousand pairs of finest cotton socks; take out<br>   the drawings for that beach hut at Brighton...<br> <br>G: Hurrah!<br> <br>E: There was, however, one slight -- ahem -- hiccup.<br> <br>G: No... `cough', I think you mean.<br> <br>E: No, sir... `Hiccup'. The motion about your improverishment has now moved<br>   on to the House of Lords.<br> <br>G: Oh, bravo! Well, no worry there, then. Every man-jack of them will be<br>   behind me.<br> <br>E: Ah, would that were so, Your Highness. These are treacherous times.<br> <br>G: Are they?<br> <br>E: Yes. It might be wise to appoint a *new* Lord, to make sure the old Lords<br>   vote the right way.<br> <br>G: Good thought... (ponders) New Lord...any idea who?<br> <br>E: Well, sir, one name does leap to mind.<br> <br>G: Does it? <br> <br>E: Yes, sir.<br> <br>G: You couldn't make it leap any higher, could you?<br> <br>E: A young man in your service, sir, who has done sterling work matching the<br>   political machinations of the evil Pitt.<br> <br>G: Ah, of course! Blackadder, oh, how can I ever thank you enough?<br> <br>E: And it might also be worth bribing a few Lords, just to make sure they <br>   vote the way their consciences tell them.<br> <br>G: Oh, well, how many should we should bribe, do you think?<br> <br>E: Oh, I think three hundred, to be sure...at a thousand pounds each.<br> <br>G: Three hundred thousand pounds?<br> <br>E: *Four* hundred thousand, I think you'll find, sir.<br> <br>(Prince tries to calculate this)<br> <br>G: Yes, yes, you're right. Well, thank God I've got you to advise me, Bladder.<br>   Just remind me, what do I have to do to appoint this Lord chappie?<br> <br>E: Oh, it's very simple, sir. You put on your robes of State, he puts on his,<br>   then you sign the Document of Ennoblement and dispatch him at once to the <br>   House of Lords.<br> <br>G: Excellent! I shall change immediately.  (leaves)<br> <br>E: And so, sir, shall I.<br> <br> <br>At Baldrick/Blackadder's Quarters<br> <br>(Edmund comes in with his `Lords' robe)<br> <br>E: Voila, Mrs. Miggins. My robes of State. My thousand pounds well spent, <br>   I think.<br> <br>M: Oooohhh, very nice! Oooohhhhhh, it's real cat, isn't it?<br> <br>E: This is not cat, Mrs. Miggins. This is finest, leather-trimmed ermine<br>   with gold medallion accessories.<br> <br>M: Oh go on, Mr. Blackadder -- it's cat. Oooh, look, they've left the little<br>   collars on!<br> <br>E: (reads a collar) `Mr. Frisky. If found, please return to Emma Hamilton,<br>   Marine Parade, Portsmouth'? oh God! Ah, well, who cares about a dead cat<br>   now that I'm a fat cat.<br> <br>M: Oooh, you're full of yourself today, Mr. B!<br> <br>E: ...which is more than can be said for Mr. Frisky.<br> <br> <br>At the Prince's House<br>(Prince has on his robe of state; Edmund enters)<br> <br>E: My Lord...<br> <br>G: My Lord*sz*.<br> <br>E: I'm sorry, sir?<br> <br>G: My Lord*sz*. There is more than one Lord in the vicinity.<br> <br>E: (chuckles) Oh, well, yes...<br> <br>G: Will you please welcome His Grace, The Lord Baldrick!<br> <br>(Baldrick enters wearing robe and hat of state; Edmund is not at all happy.)<br> <br>E: You made...Baldrick a Lord?<br> <br>G: Well, yes. `One who has recently done sterling work, matching the political<br>   machinations of the evil Pitt' -- good ol' Lord Baldrick.<br> <br>B: It's alright, Blackadder -- you don't have to curtsy or anything.<br> <br>E: Sir, might I let loose a short, violent exclamation?<br> <br>G: Well, why certainly.<br> <br>E: **DAMN**!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Thank you, sir.<br> <br>G: I say, that's a bit of a strange getup you've got there, isn't it,<br>   Blackadder?<br> <br>E: Yes, I'm just off to a fancy dress party -- I'm going as Lady Hamilton's<br>   pussy. There's just one question, sir. About the four hundred thousand<br>   to influence the Lords...<br> <br>G: Ah yes, I gave that to Lord Baldrick.<br> <br>E: Aaaah! Sir, might I be permitted to take Lord Baldrick downstairs to give <br>   him some instruction on his Lordly duties?<br> <br>G: I think that's a splendid idea.<br> <br>E: (to Baldrick) This way...My Lord... (As he walks behind Baldrick, he lifts<br>   his robe up on both ends, a la Dracula)<br> <br> <br>At Baldrick/Blackadder's Quarters<br> <br>(Edmund is holding Baldrick and thrusting his head against the table.<br> Sitting on the table is a three-foot wide turnip.)<br> <br>E: Give me the bloody money, Baldrick, or you're dead!  (stops thumping)<br> <br>B: `Give me the bloody money, Baldrick, or you're dead, *My Lord*'!<br> <br>E: (one more thump) Just do it, Baldrick! Otherwise, I shall further ennoble<br>   you by knighting you rather clumsily with this meat cleaver.<br> <br>B: I haven't got it.<br> <br>E: What?<br> <br>B: I spent it.<br> <br>E: You spent it? What could *you* possibly spend 400,000 pounds on?<br> <br>(Baldrick slowly looks toward the turnip, smiling. Edmund finally notices it.)<br> <br>E: Oh, no... Oh, God, don't tell me...<br> <br>B: ...my Dream Turnip.<br> <br>E: Baldrick, how did you manage to find a turnip that cost 400,000 pounds?<br> <br>B: Well, I had to haggle...<br> <br>(Edmund takes the turnip and forces it down over Baldrick's head)<br> <br>E: This is the worst moment of my entire life. I spent my last penny on a<br>   catskin windcheater, and I've just broken a priceless turnip.<br> <br>(There's a knock at the door, and some non-English shouting from behind it)<br> <br>E: ...and now I'm about to be viciously slaughtered by a naked Tunisian sock<br>   merchant. And all I can say, Baldrick, is this: it's the last time I<br>   dabble in politics!<br> <br>(Baldrick shrugs; end credits begin)<br> <br>     Cast:<br> <br>Edmund Blackadder, butler to the Prince<br>Mr. ROWAN ATKINSON<br> <br>Baldrick, a dogsbody<br>Mr. TONY ROBINSON<br> <br>The Prince Regent, their master<br>Mr. HUGH LAURIE<br> <br>Mrs. Miggins, a coffee shoppekeeper<br>Miss. HELEN ATKINSON-WOOD<br> <br>Mr. Vincent Hanna, his own great great great grandfather<br>Mr. VINCENT HANNA<br> <br>Sir Talbot Buxomly, a member of Parliament<br>Mr. DENIS LILL<br> <br>Pitt the Younger, the Prime Minister<br>Mr. SIMON OSBORNE<br> <br>Ivor Biggun, a candidate<br>Mr. GEOFF McGIVERN<br> <br>Pitt the even Younger, a tiny whig<br>MASTER DOMINIC MARTELLI<br> <br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> <br>Interesting things to note about this episode:<br> <br>   Pitt the Even Younger is described as a Whig -- the real William Pitt<br>   the Younger was Tory.  It seems unlikely that such a character as Pitt<br>   the Even Younger, had he existed, would have been Whig.  And Pitt the<br>   Elder never was Prime Minister.  The real PM before Pitt the Younger's<br>   first term was the Duke of Portland (well, perhaps he was a Pitt; I doubt<br>   it, though).<br> <br><br><br>
