<br>US Broadcasts Propaganda Into Afghanistan
<br>
<br>by Kendall CLARK
<br>
<br>Wednesday, 24 October 2001 
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Monkeyfirst Editor's Note. What follows are official transcripts, obtained from the Defense Link site, of US radio propaganda broadcasts into Afghanistan. The surprising aspect isn't their obviously propagandistic quality. The surprising aspect is that government propaganda and corporate media -- especially local television -- so-called news reporting are nearly indistinguishable.
<br>
<br>The Partnership of Nations is here to help
<br>1.
<br>
<br>On September 11th , the United States was the target of terrorist attacks, leaving no choice but to seek justice for these horrible crimes. We are here to take measures against the terrorists that have rooted themselves in your country. It is not you, the honorable people of Afghanistan, who are targeted, but those who would oppress you, seek to bend you to their own will, and make you their slaves.
<br>
<br>These terrorists and oppressors are currently in your country, undermining your economy, your rights as citizens, and your place within the international community. It does not have to stay that way. But the battle against these fanatics that feed off the blood of the Afghan people cannot be won without your help.
<br>
<br>It will take the combined efforts of the international community and you to remove these evil people from Afghanistan. Take the following action: Do not give food, shelter, or any type of aid to the Taliban or Usama bin Laden. This will be a great help in the effort. We have no wish to hurt you, the innocent people of Afghanistan. Stay away from military installations, government buildings, terrorist camps, roads, factories, or bridges. If you are near these places, then you must move away from them. Seek a safe place, and stay well away from anything that might be a target. We do not wish to harm you.
<br>
<br>With your help, this conflict can be over soon. And once again, Afghanistan will belong to you, and not to tyrants or outsiders. Then, you will reclaim your place among the nations of the world, and return to the honored place your country once held. Remember, we are here to help you to be free from this terrorism, despotism, and the fear and pain they bring with them. This is the best way to restore honor and dignity and make your country a free nation once again.
<br>
<br>2.
<br>
<br>Since the time of the Soviet invasion, Afghanistan has been a country in conflict. War and strife have been a constant part of the daily life of its citizens. Yet time and again, it has not been the people of Afghanistan, but outsiders who have been the real cause of this pain and destruction.
<br>
<br>Latest in the line of those who would aid in the destruction of this once great country is Usama bin Laden and the despots called the Taliban who now rule. These people have continually aided in the destruction and deterioration of Afghanistan.
<br>
<br>Afghanistan's economy is nearly non足existent, and because of the Taliban's support for terrorists such as Usama bin Laden, Afghanistan has been shunned by the international community. Even now the Taliban undermines the lives and rights of the people of Afghanistan, treating women as little more than slaves, and treating the rest of the population little better. The so足called leaders of the Taliban are disrespectful of Afghan cultural and Islamic tradition and its proud past.
<br>
<br>Now they have brought the anger of the United States and the international community upon themselves through their terrorist actions. Now, forces are coming into Afghanistan from outside places to bring justice because of the atrocities committed by Usama bin Laden and the Taliban.
<br>
<br>With the help of the nations of the world, and the people of Afghanistan, the United States will now remove these tyrants from Afghanistan. It will take a combined effort to do this, and every bit of help is needed. Try to find ways to ignore the Taliban and Usama bin Laden's requests for help, and do not give them food or shelter.
<br>
<br>The United States does not want to injure or kill innocent civilians, destroy homes, hospitals, mosques, or other public places. This is most easily avoided if people stay away from military installations, Taliban government buildings, the camps of Usama bin Laden, and other places where terrorists gather.
<br>
<br>Afghanistan can once again become the proud member of the international community that it once was. The people of Afghanistan can once again take control of their own land and set it free from the foreign invaders and local tyrants who have inserted themselves into its power structure. Help free yourselves from despotism and rejoin the nations of the world.
<br>

<br>
<br>``Just as the blood stains the apron of the butcher, unjustly shed blood remains on the hands of the murderer.'' [Afghan poem] On September 11, 2001 thousands of people were killed en masse in the United States. Among them... was a two足year足old girl. Barely able to stand or dress herself. Did she deserve to die? Why was she killed you ask? Was she a thief? What crime had she committed? She was merely on a trip with her family to visit her grandparents. Policemen... firefighters... teachers... doctors... mothers... fathers... sisters... brothers all killed.... WHY? These people did nothing to warrant the kind of wrath inflicted upon them.
<br>
<br>Thousands of good people died on that day at the hands of terrorists. Deluded fighters that prey upon the unsuspecting and the innocent. They are cowards that hide in shadows and strike at the weak. They strike out at expectant mothers, the elderly, and at little children. They fire their weapons blindly inflicting death and destruction upon the innocent. They hide like cowards and strike from afar, then return to the safety of their shadows before they can be caught. They believe they are heroes, Ghazi warriors triumphing over the evil of the West. However the truth is.... They are murderers, and do not represent Islam.
<br>
<br>It is inconceivable that any country in the world would tolerate the kinds of horrific terrorism committed against the United States. It is now that we ask for your help and support in seeing those guilty for these crimes brought to justice. United States forces may be moving into or through your area in the future. Please, for your own safety, do not interfere with United States military operations. The United States forces are not here to occupy you, nor are they here to make you give up your proud heritage. We understand that your culture and heritage is important to you and we wish to disturb it as little as possible. However we must seek out justice for those who have fallen victim to terrorists. Terrorists and those who harbor terrorists must be stopped. With your support we will ensure that those guilty will be brought to justice.
<br>
<br>4.
<br>
<br>Dear Afghanistan... A grave crime has been committed against the United States. Four of our planes have been hijacked, several building in our economic centers destroyed and more than 6,000 innocent people, hundreds of which were Muslim were murdered by the hand of Usama bin Laden, Al Quaeda, his supporters, and the Taliban. We see these actions as acts of war. We will not sit idly by and do nothing in these times. However, we do not wish to spill the blood of innocent people, as did the cowardly terrorists. We do not blame the Muslims or Afghans for these attacks. We do not hold those who follow true Islam responsible. We will hunt down and punish these terrorists. They will pay with their blood. America is not against the beliefs of Islam, nor is it against Muslims. More than 6 million Muslims live and worship Allah in peace in the United States, a number equal to almost half the population of Afghanistan. In the United States people of all religions live side by side in peace. Muslims living in America have the same rights to worship as any other citizen of any other religion.
<br>
<br>We are not here to attack your religion, or your way of life. We are attacking the terrorists and their hosts, the Taliban, for the atrocities committed against the United States. We do not wish to harm or occupy the people of Afghanistan. The terrorists see themselves as heroes, martyrs, and saviors. However, no nation or religion would tolerate the kinds of viscous unprovoked attacks like those committed against the United States. These acts of terror and violence are inexcusable in any culture, and we will bring to justice those who have committed these crimes.
<br>
<br>5.
<br>
<br>Attention Taliban! You are condemned. Did you know that? The instant the terrorists you support took over our planes, you sentenced yourselves to death. The Armed Forces of the United States are here to seek justice for our dead. Highly trained soldiers are coming to shut down once and for all Usama bin Laden's ring of terrorism, and the Taliban that supports them and their actions.
<br>
<br>Our forces are armed with state of the art military equipment. What are you using, obsolete and ineffective weaponry? Our helicopters will rain fire down upon your camps before you detect them on your radar. Our bombs are so accurate we can drop them right through your windows. Our infantry is trained for any climate and terrain on earth.
<br>
<br>United States soldiers fire with superior marksmanship and are armed with superior weapons. You have only one choice... Surrender now and we will give you a second chance.
<br>
<br>We will let you live. If you surrender no harm will come to you. When you decide to surrender, approach United States forces with your hands in the air. Sling your weapon across your back muzzle towards the ground. Remove your magazine and expel any rounds. Doing this is your only chance of survival.
<br>
<br>6.
<br>
<br>Taliban leaders! By harboring Al Quaeda and their leader Usama bin Laden you have declared war on the United States, and by doing this you have just guaranteed your own demise. Hand over these criminals and you will save yourselves from destruction. By not turning over Usama bin Laden and Al Quaeda to stand trial you are showing the world you are weak, and that you need a criminal organization and its leader to protect you.
<br>
<br>However, they cannot protect you from what will happen if you do not comply. Like all criminals they will try to hide from their impending punishment. They will leave you to fight the United States and our overwhelming military by yourselves. Our military is bigger, faster and stronger; with more modernized weapons and better足trained troops. You will be attacked by land, sea, and air. There will be no warning as to when and where we will attack. Destruction is imminent if our will is not met. Bin Laden may tell you he can protect you from the mighty United States, but all he can protect you from are unarmed innocent men, women, and children. He can have his subordinates hijack civilian airplanes and take bombs into to civilian buildings, but he cannot save you from the justice of the United States. Resistance is futile, our goals will be achieved. If not willingly than by overwhelming force. You have but one choice, and that is to comply quickly, for time is short. You will suffer the same fate as the terrorist if you do not comply with our demand.
<br>
<br>Taliban actions are Non Islamic
<br>1.
<br>
<br>Tragedy struck the United States on 11 September 2001 when terrorist hijackers took over two Boeing 767 jets and two Boeing 757 jets. American Airlines and United Airlines flights were the hijacked and used in the acts to kill over 6,500 innocent men, women, and children. Many of these people were not American; but representatives from 67 countries from all over the world. Many were even Muslims. The hijackers proceeded to crash the planes into World Trade Center Towers one and two. Another plane crashed on a field in Pennsylvania when heroic passengers retook control of the aircraft. Hundreds of innocent lives were lost on just the aircraft alone. Thousands are feared to have been lost in the attack on the former World Trade Center Towers, that collapsed as a result of the terrorist act.
<br>
<br>We ask that you, the true people of Afghanistan, help us bring Usama bin Laden and members of his terrorist group, Al Quaeda, to justice for crimes committed against innocent people. Not only have Usama bin Laden and Al Quaeda committed crimes against the United States, but they have also dishonored Afghanistan and helped in the continuation of bloodshed in your country. They are using your country as a nest of terrorism to kill your people and innocent Americans. These outsiders do not care about the welfare of Afghanistan, nor of their countries, and people all over the world. Theses terrorist are blackening the reputation of the people of Afghanistan and Islam. The people of Afghanistan are known for bravery and upholding honor. These terrorists, with their cowardice ruin this reputation. You can help by not interfering with United States troops or operations, by not supplying him or his supporters with food, water, or lodging. Small things such as these will make the biggest impact.
<br>
<br>United States forces do not want to see a senseless loss of life. We do not want to take over your nation; we want to give it back to its rightful owners, the people of Afghanistan. The United States wants to see a return to prosperity for your nation. With your help we can achieve this. If we work together Usama bin Laden, his supporters, and terrorist like them will no longer be able to incite fear in people around the world.
<br>
<br>2.
<br>
<br>Do you enjoy being ruled by the Taliban? Are you proud to live a life of fear? Are you happy to see the place your family has owned for generations a terrorist training site? Are you proud to live under a government that harbors terrorists? Are you proud to live in a nation ruled by extreme fundamentalists?
<br>
<br>The Taliban have robbed your country of your heritage. They have destroyed your national monuments, and cultural artifacts. They rule by force, violence, and fear. They insist that their form of Islam is the one and only form, the true form, the divine form. They see themselves as religious experts. They seek to rob you and your nation of its past. That which has brought you together as a nation over the past thousands of years is being slowly torn apart. They destroy your national treasures. They also harbor terrorists.
<br>
<br>United States forces have come to stop Usama bin Laden and to shut down the terrorist camps once and for all. United States forces are here to strike back at the Taliban and at the rest of Bin Laden's fighters. It is the United State's right as a nation to seek justice for those killed in the attacks on the World Trade Center. Over 6500 people lost their lives in the attacks on the World Trade Center, many of whom were not American, but representatives from other countries around the world. Many were Muslim. Terrorists and those who harbor terrorists must be brought to justice. Do not interfere with United States military operations. Battlefields are places for soldiers, not civilians. Our soldiers are not here to take over your way of life. Your culture is important to you, and to us. We do not wish to destroy it.
<br>
<br>3.
<br>
<br>People of Afghanistan, do you support the puppet rulers of your nation and their political practices? How can you support the Taliban when they give refuge to Usama bin Laden, whose evil actions are aimed at Muslims and non足Muslims alike? The result of a terrorist attack does not differentiate between people. It kills people of all ages, races and religions. Usama bin Laden would have you believe he is for a united Islamic nation, but how can that be true when even his home nation has exiled him? Saudi Arabia exiled him in 1991 and in 1994 he lost his Saudi Arabian citizenship as a result of his terrorist activities. Usama bin Laden is a coward who hides behind cowardly attacks on innocent people, killing them because they disagree with his twisted, non足Islamic beliefs. The Taliban support his criminal and inhumane activities by doing nothing to bring him to justice. The Taliban regime is not even a recognized government by most of the world community. Yet its leaders dictate over you, when it is you, the honored people of Afghanistan, who should live under your own laws and beliefs and not the laws and beliefs of a terrorist supporting regime. Think of your children. Do you want them to live in fear of what one man and his supporters would do to them if their beliefs differed from his? What if he decides that not only Western nations pose a threat, but also Muslim nations that do not agree with his way of life? Contrary to his beliefs the United States is neither anti足Muslim, nor against the people of Afghanistan, but we are for an Afghanistan free from oppression, killing, and poverty.
<br>
<br>4.
<br>
<br>Noble people of Afghanistan... Today is a day of mourning for your country. Your history and culture are being destroyed. The Taliban have tried to erase your past to hide you from the truth. They have destroyed historical and religious monuments in order to instill their form of aberrant Islam. They say that they are doing it for your own protection.
<br>
<br>You have lived together for hundreds of years before the Taliban. What do the Taliban give you? Do they listen to you? Do they supply you with food and medicine or do they hoard it for themselves? The Taliban tells you that dying for their fanatical form of Islam is a proud and noble thing to do. They encourage you to be martyrs, but in reality, they are cowards hiding behind farmers, and families. If dying for this form of Islam is noble, why doesn't Mullah Omar go to the fronts? He is enjoying his luxurious quarters and his wives while you are asked to die.
<br>
<br>The Taliban has tarnished the name of your proud nation by making it a haven for criminals and terrorists. They have provided supplies intended for the people of Afghanistan to Usama bin Laden and Al Quaeda. Their actions are bringing war to your homes. Is this what you want? Is this the kind of future you want for your children? Speak out! Stand up and let your voice be heard! Resist, and encourage your friends and neighbors to resist! The Taliban have gone too far! The Taliban can only rule if you choose to let them.
<br>
<br>Aid will be brought to your location.
<br>1.
<br>
<br>Attention! People of Afghanistan, United States forces will be moving through you area. We are not here to harm you! We are here for Usama bin Laden, Al Quaeda, and those who protect them! Please, for you own safety, stay off bridges and roadways, and do not interfere with our troops or military operations. If you do this, you will not be harmed. Do not approach United States forces. Stay in your homes! We are not here to occupy you, or to overrun your country. If you see United States forces, you need to find shelter and not leave it until we have left the area. This is for your protection. Roadways and bridges will be unsafe for travel. Your home will be the safest place. Do not listen to the Taliban or Al Quaeda. We will not harm you if you comply with these instructions. Once again, we do not want to harm any innocent people.
<br>
<br>Safety and Security.
<br>1.
<br>
<br>Attention, people of Afghanistan! Aid is being dropped by plane at a very high altitude using large parachutes. These parachutes slow their descent. Despite the parachutes, the bundles will still fall very fast. These bundles will drift and shift directions due to wind. These bundles may appear small, but they are in fact very large and heavy. Do not stand directly below them. Let the bundles land and settle before you approach them. If you follow these instructions you will not be injured. The bundles are filled with food, water, and medical supplies. The bundles will not contain any military related supplies or equipment. These have been given to you by the United States in an effort to show our support for the fair people of Afghanistan. The United States does not want you, the innocent people of Afghanistan, to suffer for the deeds of Al Quaeda and its leader Usama bin laden. That is why the United States has prepared and delivered these aid bundles. The United States can not warn you enough about the danger that you will put yourself in if you do not stay away from the bundles until they land. Once the bundles have landed and settled you can retrieve the supplies. These supplies are being sent to help you, because you did not commit the crimes against the United States, Al Quaeda and its supporter did.
