<br>
<br>Private Plane
<br>Scene 1: BA's Dugout
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>[BA is listening to his phonograph.  Artillery firing outside is causing the
<br> record to skip frequently.  Annoyed, BA storms outside.]
<br>
<br>
<br>Scene 2: In The Trench
<br>----------------------
<br>
<br>[Lt. George is in the trench, peering through a pair of binoculars across
<br> No Man's Land.]
<br>
<br>BA               Oh, God, why do they bother?
<br>
<br>George           Well, it's to kill Jerry, isn't it, Sir?
<br>
<br>BA               Yes, but Jerry is safe underground in concrete bunkers.
<br>                 We've shot off over a million cannon shells and what's
<br>                 the result?  One dachshund with a slight limp!
<br>
<br>[BA yells at the artillery.]
<br>
<br>BA               Shut up!
<br>
<br>[Artillery ceases.  George looks bemused.]
<br>
<br>BA               Thank you!  Right, I'm off to bed where I intend to
<br>                 sleep until my name changes to Rip Van Adder.
<br>
<br>[BA goes into his dugout.]
<br>
<br>
<br>Scene 3: BA's Dugout
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>[The phonograph is still playing.  BA stops it and lies down on his cot.
<br> An instant after his head touches the pillow there is the sound of
<br> aircraft and gunfire from outside.  BA rises from his cot.]
<br>
<br>BA               Oh, God!  Bloody Germans!  They can't take a joke, can
<br>                 they?  Just because we take a few pot-shots at them,
<br>                 they have to have an air-raid to get their own back.
<br>                 Where are our airforce?
<br>
<br>[BA moves over to the table.  A field-telephone sits on the table]
<br>
<br>BA               They're meant to defend us against this sort of thing.
<br>
<br>[Noise outside continues.  BA puts on steel helmet, picks up telephone and
<br> dives under the table.]
<br>
<br>BA               Right, that's it!
<br>
<br>[Picks up receiver.]
<br>
<br>BA               Hello?  Yes, yes, I'd like to leave a message for the
<br>                 head of the Flying Corps, please.  That's Air Chief
<br>                 Marshall Sir Hugh Massingburg-Massingburg, VC, DFC and
<br>                 bar.  Message reads "Where are you, you bastard?"
<br>
<br>[Private Baldrick enters the dugout.]
<br>
<br>Baldrick         Here I am, Sir.
<br>
<br>[BA puts down the receiver.]
<br>
<br>BA               For God's sake, Baldrick, take cover.
<br>
<br>Baldrick         Why's that, Sir?
<br>
<br>BA               Because there's an air-raid going on and I don't want to
<br>                 have to write to your mother at London Zoo and tell her
<br>                 that her only human child is dead.
<br>
<br>[Baldrick moves under the table with BA]
<br>
<br>Baldrick         All right, Sir.  It's just that I didn't know there was an
<br>                 air-raid on.  I couldn't hear anything over the noise of
<br>                 the terrific display by our wonderful boys of the Royal
<br>                 Flying Corps, Sir.
<br>
<br>BA               What?
<br>
<br>[George enters the dugout.]
<br>
<br>George           I say, those chaps can't half thunder in their airborne
<br>                 steeds, can't they just?
<br>
<br>[George notices BA and Baldrick cowering under the table.]
<br>
<br>George           Oh, hello, what's going on here?  Game of hide and seek?
<br>                 Excellent!  Right now, I'll go and count to a hundred.
<br>                 Er, no.  Better make it five, actually . . .
<br>
<br>BA               George . . .
<br>
<br>George           Er.  Oh, it's sardines.  Oh, excellent!  That's my favourite
<br>                 one, that.
<br>
<br>[BA rises from under the table.]
<br>
<br>BA               George . . .
<br>
<br>George           Yes, Sir?
<br>
<br>BA               Shut up, and never say anything again as long as you live.
<br>
<br>George           Right you are, Sir.
<br>
<br>[BA removes helmet.  George is quiet for a few seconds.]
<br>
<br>George           Crikey, but what a show it was, Sir.  Lord Flasheart's
<br>                 Flying Aces.  How we cheered when they spun.  How we
<br>                 shouted when they dived.  How we applauded when one chap
<br>                 got sliced in half by his own propeller.  Well, it's all
<br>                 part of the joke for those magnificent men in their
<br>                 flying machines.
<br>
<br>[Sound of plane plummeting, then crashing outside.]
<br>
<br>BA               For `magnificent men', read `biggest showoffs since Lady
<br>                 Godiva entered the Royal Enclosure at Ascot claiming she
<br>                 had literally nothing to wear'.  I don't care how many
<br>                 times they go up-diddly-up-up, they're still gits!
<br>
<br>Baldrick         Oh, come on, Sir!  I'd love to be a flier.  Up there where
<br>                 the air is clear.
<br>
<br>BA               The chances of the air being clear anywhere near you,
<br>                 Baldrick, are zero!
<br>
<br>Baldrick         Oh, Sir.  It'd be great, swooping and diving.
<br>
<br>[Baldrick starts his impression of a Sopwith Camel.]
<br>
<br>BA               Baldrick . . .
<br>
<br>[Baldrick drones on . . .]
<br>
<br>BA               Baldrick . . .
<br>
<br>[Baldrick stops droning on as BA interjects a third time.]
<br>
<br>BA               Baldrick, what are you doing?
<br>
<br>Baldrick         I'm a Sopwith Camel, Sir.
<br>
<br>BA               Oh, it is a Sopwith Camel.  Ah, right, I always get confused
<br>                 between the sound of a Sopwith Camel and the sound of a
<br>                 malodourous runt wasting everybodys time.  Now if you
<br>                 can do without me in the nursery for a while, I'm going
<br>                 to get some fresh air.
<br>
<br>[BA leaves the dugout, picking up his pipe on the way out.]
<br>
<br>
<br>Scene 4: In The Trench
<br>----------------------
<br>
<br>[As he emerges from the dugout BA sighs and prepares to light his pipe.
<br> Squadron Commander Lord Flasheart jumps down from his crashed plane.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Ha!  Eat knuckle, Fritz!
<br>
<br>[Flasheart knocks BA to the ground with his pistol, then puts a foot on
<br> BA's chest.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Aha!  How disgusting.  A Boche on the sole of my boot.
<br>                 I shall have to find a patch of grass to wipe it on.
<br>                 Probably get shunned in the Officers' Mess.  Sorry about
<br>                 the pong you fellows, trod in a Boche and can't get rid
<br>                 of the whiff.
<br>
<br>[BA rises.]
<br>
<br>BA               Do you think we could dispense with the hilarious doggy-do
<br>                 metaphor for a moment?  I'm not a Boche.  This is a British
<br>                 trench.
<br>
<br>[Flasheart puts his pistol away.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Is it?  Oh, that's a piece of luck.  Thought I'd landed
<br>                 sausage-side!  Ha!
<br>
<br>[Flasheart picks up the receiver of a field-telephone lying by the dugout
<br> entrance.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Mind if I use your phone?  If word gets out that I'm
<br>                 missing, five hundred girls will kill themselves.  I wouldn't
<br>                 want them on my conscience, not when they ought to be on
<br>                 my face!  Huh!
<br>
<br>[Flasheart kicks the phone into action.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Hi, Flasheart here.  Yeah, cancel the state funeral, tell
<br>                 the King to stop blubbing.  Flash is not dead.  I simply
<br>                 ran out of juice!  Yeah, and before all the girls start
<br>                 saying "Oh, what's the point of living anymore", I'm talking
<br>                 about petrol!  Woof, woof!
<br>                 Yeah, I dumped the kite on the proles, so send a car. Er,
<br>                 General Melchett's driver should do.  She hangs around with
<br>                 the big nobs, so she'll be used to a fellow like me!  Woof,
<br>                 woof!
<br>
<br>BA               Look, do you think you could make your obscene phone call
<br>                 somewhere else?
<br>
<br>[Flasheart is still on the phone and ignores BA.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        No, not in half an hour, you rubber-desk johnny.  Send the
<br>                 bitch with the wheels right now or I'll fly back to
<br>                 England and give your wife something to hang her towels on.
<br>
<br>[Flasheart throws down the receiver.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Okay, dig out your best booze and let's talk about me
<br>                 'til the car comes.  You must be pretty impressed having
<br>                 Squadron Commander the Lord Flasheart drop in on your
<br>                 squalid bit of line.
<br>
<br>BA               Actually, no.  I was more impressed by the contents of my
<br>                 handkerchief the last time I blew my nose.
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Yeah, like hell.  Huh, huh.  You've probably got little
<br>                 piccies of me on the walls of your dugout, haven't you?
<br>
<br>[Flasheart tickles the front of BA's trousers.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        I bet you go all girly and giggly every time you look at
<br>                 me.
<br>
<br>[Flasheart twists BA's John Thomas.  BA (naturally) screams.]
<br>
<br>BA               I'm afraid not.  Unfortunately, most of the infantry think
<br>                 you're a prat.  Ask them who they'd prefer to meet:
<br>                 Squadron Commander Flasheart and the man who cleans out
<br>                 the public toilets in Aberdeen, and they'd go for Wee Jock
<br>                 "Poo-Pong" McPlop, every time.
<br>
<br>[Flasheart laughs, then belts BA, knocking him to the floor.]
<br>[Flasheart goes into the dugout.]
<br>
<br>
<br>Scene 5: BA's Dugout
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>[George and Baldrick are discussing the Flying Aces.]
<br>
<br>George           . . . so when that fellow looped-the-loop, I honestly
<br>                 thought that, that, that . . .
<br>
<br>[Flasheart enters, saluting.  George sees him.  BA enters behind Flasheart.]
<br>
<br>George           My God!
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Yes, I suppose I am.
<br>
<br>George           Lord Flasheart, this is the greatest honour of my life.
<br>                 I hope I snuff it right now to preserve this moment
<br>                 forever.
<br>
<br>BA               It can be arranged.
<br>
<br>Baldrick         Lord Flasheart, I want to learn to write so I can send a
<br>                 letter home about this golden moment.
<br>
<br>Flasheart        So all the fellows hate me, eh?  Not a bit of it.  I'm
<br>                 your bloody hero, eh, old scout?
<br>
<br>[Flasheart playfully scuffs up Baldrick's hair, then notices that this
<br> action has left something unpleasant on his glove.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Jesus!
<br>
<br>[Flasheart wipes his glove on BA's shirt.]
<br>
<br>Baldrick         My Lord, I've got every cigarette card they ever printed of
<br>                 you.  My whole family took up smoking just so that we could
<br>                 get the whole set.  My grandmother smoked herself to
<br>                 death so we could afford the album.
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Of course she did, of course she did, the poor love-crazed
<br>                 old octogenarian.
<br>
<br>[Flasheart moves to hug and kiss Baldrick, then thinks better of it.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Well, all right, you fellows.  Let's sit us down and yarn
<br>                 about how amazingly attractive I am.
<br>
<br>BA               Yes, would you excuse me for a moment?  I've got some
<br>                 urgent business.  There's a bucket outside I've got to be
<br>                 sick into.
<br>
<br>[Flasheart takes the mickey out of BA's holier-than-thou attitude.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        All right, you chaps, let's get comfy.
<br>
<br>[Flasheart sits down in chair.  George sits down on BA's cot.  Flasheart
<br> turns to Baldrick.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        You look like a decent British bloke.  I'll park the old
<br>                 booties on you if that's okay.
<br>
<br>Baldrick         It would be an honour, my Lord.
<br>
<br>[Baldrick kneels down on all fours in front of Flasheart.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Of course it would!  Ha!
<br>
<br>[Flasheart rests his feet on Baldrick's back and sighs.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Have you any idea what it's like to have the wind
<br>                 rushing through your hair?
<br>
<br>George           No, Sir.
<br>
<br>[Flasheart breaks wind in Baldrick's face.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        He has!
<br>
<br>
<br>Scene 6: BA's Dugout
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>[Some time has elapsed.  Flasheart is regaling an enthralled George with
<br> stories.  BA is reading a copy of `King and Country' at the table,
<br> uninterested in what Flasheart has to say.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        . . . so I flew straight through her bedroom window,
<br>                 popped a box of chocs on the dressing table,
<br>                 machine-gunned my telephone number into the wall, and
<br>                 then shot off and shagged her sister.
<br>
<br>[As George creases up, Bobby Parkhurst enters the dugout.]
<br>
<br>Bobby            Ahem.  Driver Parkhurst reporting for duty, my Lord . . .
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Well, well, well.  If it isn't little Bobby Parkhurst--
<br>                 saucier than a direct hit on a Heinz factory.
<br>
<br>Bobby            I've come to pick you up.
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Well, that's how I like my girls--direct and to my point.
<br>                 Woof!
<br>
<br>Bobby            Woof!
<br>
<br>[Flasheart removes his feet from Baldrick,  grabs Bobby and puts her across
<br> his lap and begins to snog her.  During the snog BA sarcastically checks
<br> his watch.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Ah!  Tally ho, then!  Back to the bar.  You should join
<br>                 the Flying Corps, George.  That's the way to fight a war.
<br>                 Tasty tuck, soft beds and a uniform so smart it's got a
<br>                 PhD from Cambridge.
<br>
<br>[Flasheart gestures at Baldrick.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        You could even bring the breath monster here.  Anyone can
<br>                 be a navigator if he can tell his arse from his elbow.
<br>
<br>BA               Well, that's Baldrick out, I fear . . .
<br>
<br>Flasheart        We're always looking for talented types to join the
<br>                 Twenty Minuters.
<br>
<br>BA               . . . and there goes George.
<br>
<br>[Flasheart rises from the chair, lifting Bobby in his arms.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Tally ho, then, Bobby.  Hush, here comes a whizz-bang and I
<br>                 think you know what I'm talking about!  Woof!
<br>
<br>Bobby            Woof!
<br>
<br>[Flasheart and Bobby leave.]
<br>
<br>BA               God, it's like Crufts in here!
<br>
<br>[Baldrick and George stand.]
<br>
<br>George           I say, Sir.  What a splendid notion.  The Twenty Minuters.
<br>                 Soft tucker, tasty beds, fluffy uniforms.
<br>
<br>Baldrick         Begging your permission, Sir, but why do they call them the
<br>                 Twenty Minuters?
<br>
<br>George           Ah, now, yes, . . .
<br>
<br>[George moves across the dugout to get his card album.]
<br>
<br>George           . . . now this one is in my Brooke Bond `Book of the Air'.
<br>
<br>[George returns to the cot and sits down.]
<br>
<br>George           Now, you have to collect all the cards and then stick them
<br>                 into this wonderful presentation booklet.  Er . . .
<br>
<br>[Baldrick sits down next to George.]
<br>
<br>George           Ah, here we are: Twenty Minuters.  Oh, damn!  Haven't got
<br>                 the card yet.  Ah, but the caption says `Twenty minutes is
<br>                 the average amount of time new pilots spend in the air.'
<br>
<br>BA               Twenty minutes.
<br>
<br>George           That's right, Sir.
<br>
<br>BA               I had a twenty hour watch yesterday, with four hours
<br>                 overtime, in two feet of water.
<br>
<br>[George, then Baldrick, rise from the cot and move to the table.]
<br>
<br>George           Well then, for goodness sake, Sir, why don't we join?
<br>
<br>Baldrick         Yeah, be better than just sitting around here all day on our
<br>                 elbows.
<br>
<br>BA               No thank you.  No thank you.  I have no desire to hang
<br>                 around with a bunch of upper-class delinquents, do twenty
<br>                 minutes work, and then spend the rest of the day loafing
<br>                 about in Paris drinking gallons of champagne and having
<br>                 dozens of moist, pink, highly-experienced young French
<br>                 peasant girls galloping up and down my . . .  Hang on!
<br>
<br>
<br>Scene 7: Captain Darling's Office
<br>---------------------------------
<br>
<br>[Captain Darling is writing at his desk.  There is a knock at the office door.]
<br>
<br>Darling          Come!
<br>
<br>[BA enters the office.]
<br>
<br>Darling          Ah, Captain Blackadder.
<br>
<br>BA               Good morning, Captain Darling.
<br>
<br>Darling          What do you want?
<br>
<br>BA               You're looking so well.
<br>
<br>Darling          I'm a busy man, Blackadder.  Let's hear it, whatever it is.
<br>
<br>BA               Well, you know, Darling, every . . . every man has a
<br>                 dream . . .
<br>
<br>Darling          Hmmm . . .
<br>
<br>BA               . . . and when I was a small boy, I used to watch the marsh
<br>                 warblers swooping in my mothers undercroft, and I remember
<br>                 thinking `Will men ever dare do the same?'  And you know . . .
<br>
<br>[Darling rises from his desk.]
<br>
<br>Darling          Oh, you want to join the Royal Flying Corps?
<br>
<br>BA               Oh, that's a thought.  Could I?
<br>
<br>Darling          No, you couldn't!  Goodbye!
<br>
<br>[Darling sits back down.]
<br>
<br>BA               Look, come on, Darling, just give me an application form.
<br>
<br>Darling          It's out of the question.  This is simply a ruse to waste
<br>                 five months of training after which you'll claim you can't
<br>                 fly after all because it makes your ears go `pop'.  Come on,
<br>                 I wasn't born yesterday, Blackadder.
<br>
<br>BA               More's the pity, we could have started your personality from
<br>                 scratch.  So, the training period is five months, is it?
<br>
<br>Darling          It's no concern of yours if it's five years and comes with a
<br>                 free holiday in Tunisia, contraceptives supplied.  Besides,
<br>                 they wouldn't admit you.  It's not easy getting transfers,
<br>                 you know.
<br>
<br>[Darling returns to his work.]
<br>
<br>BA               Oh, you've tried it yourself, have you?
<br>
<br>[Darling breaks his pencil.]
<br>
<br>Darling          No, I haven't.
<br>
<br>BA               Trust you to try and skive off to some cushy option.
<br>
<br>Darling          There's nothing cushy about life in the Womens Auxiliary
<br>                 Balloon Corps.
<br>
<br>[BA raises his eyebrows at this.]
<br>
<br>Darling          Ah . . .
<br>
<br>[The door to General Melchett's office opens and the General and George
<br> enter.  BA and Darling snap to attention.  BA salutes.]
<br>
<br>George           . . . and then the bishop said "I'm awfully sorry, I
<br>                 didn't realise you meant organist."
<br>
<br>[Melchett chortles.]
<br>
<br>Melchett         Thank you, George.  At ease, everyone.  Now, where's my
<br>                 map?  Come on.
<br>
<br>Darling          Sir!
<br>
<br>[Darling hands Melchett his map.]
<br>
<br>Melchett         Thank you.
<br>
<br>[Melchett unfurls the map the wrong way.]
<br>
<br>Melchett         God, it's a barren, featureless desert out there, isn't it.
<br>
<br>Darling          The other side, Sir!
<br>
<br>[Melchett turns the map over.  BA turns to George.]
<br>
<br>BA               Hello, George.  What are you doing here?
<br>
<br>George           Me, Sir?  I just popped in to join the Royal Flying Corps.
<br>
<br>[Melchett looks up from his map.]
<br>
<br>Melchett         Hello, Blackadder.  What are you doing here?
<br>
<br>BA               Me, Sir?  I just popped in to join the Royal Flying Corps.
<br>
<br>Darling          And, of course, I said . . .
<br>
<br>Melchett         Bravo, I hope, Darling.  Because, you know, I've always had
<br>                 my doubts about you trenchy-type fellows.  Always suspected
<br>                 there might be a bit too much of the battle-dodging,
<br>                 nappy-wearing, I'd-rather-have-a-cup-of-tea-than-charge-
<br>                 stark-naked-at-Jerry about you.  But if you're willing to
<br>                 join the Twenty Minuters then you're all right by me and
<br>                 welcome to marry my sister any day.
<br>
<br>Darling          Are you sure about this, Sir?
<br>
<br>Melchett         Certainly, you should hear the noise she makes when she eats
<br>                 a boiled egg.  Be glad to get her out of the house.  So,
<br>                 report back here 09:00 hours for your basic training.
<br>
<br>
<br>Scene 8: Captain Darling's Office
<br>---------------------------------
<br>
<br>[It is the next morning.  Darling's office has been set out with chairs and
<br> there is a blackboard with a chalk picture of a Sopwith Camel on it.  BA and
<br> George are in the front row of seats.  There are three other trainees.
<br> Darling is at his desk at the back.]
<br>
<br>George           Crikey!  I'm looking forward to today.  Up-diddly-up,
<br>                 down-diddly-down, whoops-poop, twiddly-dee, a decent scrap
<br>                 with the fiendish Red Baron, a bit of a jolly old crash
<br>                 landing behind enemy lines, capture, torture, escape and
<br>                 then back home in time for tea and medals.
<br>
<br>BA               George, who's using the family brain-cell at the moment?
<br>                 This is just the beginning of the training.  The beginning
<br>                 of five long months of very clever, very dull men looking
<br>                 at machinery.
<br>
<br>[Flasheart is heard in the corridor.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Hey, girls!  Look at my machinery!
<br>
<br>[The sound of screaming women is heard from the corridor.  Flasheart enters
<br> Darling's office, zipping up his flys.  He is carrying a stick.  All present
<br> rise to attention.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Enter a man who has no underwear.  Ask me why.
<br>
<br>All except BA    Why do you have no underwear, Lord Flash?
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Because the pants haven't been built yet that'll take the
<br>                 job on.
<br>
<br>[Flasheart performs a groinal thrust.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        And that's the type of guy who's doing the training around
<br>                 here.  Sit down!
<br>
<br>[All sit.  Flasheart notices BA.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Well, well, well, well, well.  If it isn't old Captain
<br>                 Slack Bladder.
<br>
<br>BA               Blackadder.
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Couldn't resist it, eh, Slack Bladder?  Told you you thought
<br>                 I was great.  All right men, let's do-oo-oo it!  The first
<br>                 thing to remember is: always treat your kite . . .
<br>
<br>[Flasheart taps the picture of the Sopwith Camel with his stick.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        . . . like you treat your woman!
<br>
<br>[Flasheart  whips the air with his cane.]
<br>
<br>George           How, how do you mean, Sir?  Do you mean, do you mean take her
<br>                 home at weekends to meet your mother?
<br>
<br>Flasheart        No, I mean get inside her five times a day and take her to
<br>                 heaven and back.
<br>
<br>[George smirks.]
<br>
<br>BA               I'm beginning to see why the Suffragette Movement want the
<br>                 vote.
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Hey, hey!  Any bird who wants to chain herself to my railings
<br>                 and suffer a jet movement gets my vote.  Er, right.  Well,
<br>                 I'll see you in ten minutes for take-off.
<br>
<br>[Flasheart begins to leave.]
<br>
<br>BA               Hang on, hang on!  What about the months of training?
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Hey, wet-pants!  This isn't the Womens Auxiliary Balloon
<br>                 Corps.  You're in the Twenty Minuters now.
<br>
<br>[Darling stands up.]
<br>
<br>Darling          Er, Sir . . .
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Yes . . .
<br>
<br>Darling          . . . Sir!
<br>
<br>Flasheart        . . . Prat at the back!
<br>
<br>Darling          I think we'd all be intrigued to know why you're called the
<br>                 Twenty Minuters.
<br>
<br>George           Oh, Mister Thicko.  Imagine not knowing that.
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Well, it's simple!  The average life expectancy for a new
<br>                 pilot is twenty minutes.
<br>
<br>Darling          Ah . . .
<br>
<br>[Darling sits.]
<br>
<br>BA               Life expectancy . . . of twenty minutes . . .
<br>
<br>Flasheart        That's right.  Goggles on, chocks away, last one back's a
<br>                 homo!  Hurray!
<br>
<br>[Flasheart runs out of the room.]
<br>
<br>Trainee Pilots   Hurray!
<br>
<br>[Trainee Pilots run after Flasheart.]
<br>
<br>BA               So, we take off in ten minutes, we're in the air for twenty
<br>                 minutes, which means we should be dead by twenty five to ten.
<br>
<br>George           Hairy blighters, Sir.  This is a bit of a turn-up for the
<br>                 plus fours.
<br>
<br>[Darling rises and moves to the door.]
<br>
<br>Darling          I shouldn't worry about it too much, Blackadder.  Flying's
<br>                 all about navigation.  As long as you've got a good navigator
<br>                 I'm sure you'll be fine.
<br>
<br>[Darling sniggers as he opens the door to reveal Baldrick in flying gear.
<br> Baldrick enters.  Darling leaves.]
<br>
<br>
<br>Scene 9: In The Air
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>[BA and Baldrick are flying in a Sopwith Camel.  George is another Camel.]
<br>
<br>BA               Actually, they're right.  This is a doddle.
<br>
<br>Baldrick         Careful, Sir!
<br>
<br>BA               Whoops, whoops, a little wobble there.  I'll get the hang
<br>                 of it, don't worry.  All right, Baldrick, how many rounds
<br>                 have we got?
<br>
<br>Baldrick         Er, five hundred, Sir.  Cheese and tomato for you, rat for
<br>                 me.
<br>
<br>George           Tally-bally ho!
<br>
<br>Baldrick         What's this?
<br>
<br>[Baldrick climbs out of his seat.]
<br>
<br>BA               Baldrick!  Baldrick!  Will you stop arsing about and get back
<br>                 in the plane!
<br>
<br>Baldrick         Ooh, ooh, ooh!  Hey, Sir, I can see a pretty red plane from
<br>                 up here.  Ha ha!  Woo woo!
<br>
<br>von Richthoven   Schnell!  Da unten!  Ha ha ha!
<br>
<br>[von Richthoven shoots out one of the wing-supports on Blackadders aircraft.]
<br>
<br>BA               Oh no!  Watch out, Baldrick, it's stood right on our tail.
<br>                 Yes, now this is developing into a distinctly boring
<br>                 situation, but we're still on our side of the line so I'll
<br>                 crash-land and claim my ears went `pop' first time out.
<br>
<br>Baldrick         Ooh, let's hope we fall on something soft!
<br>
<br>BA               Fine.  I'll try and aim between General Melchett's ears!
<br>
<br>
<br>Scene 10: A German Prison Cell
<br>------------------------------
<br>
<br>[BA is pacing about the cell.  Baldrick is seated.]
<br>
<br>BA               I don't believe it.  A German prison cell.  For two and a
<br>                 half years the Western Front has been as likely to move as a
<br>                 Frenchman who lives next door to a brothel, and last night the
<br>                 Germans advance a mile and we land on the wrong side.
<br>
<br>Baldrick         Ooh, dear, Captain B, my tummy's gone all squirty.
<br>
<br>BA               That means you're scared, Baldrick, and you're not the only
<br>                 one.  I couldn't be more petrified if a wild rhinoceros had
<br>                 just come home from a hard day at the swamp and found me
<br>                 wearing his pyjamas, smoking his cigars and in bed with his
<br>                 wife.
<br>
<br>Baldrick         I've heard what these Germans will do, Sir.  They'll have
<br>                 their wicked way with anything of woman-born.
<br>
<br>BA               Well, in that case, Baldrick, you're quite safe.  However,
<br>                 the Teutonic reputation for brutality is well-founded: their
<br>                 operas last three or four days; and they have no word
<br>                 for `fluffy'.
<br>
<br>Baldrick         I want my mum!
<br>
<br>BA               Yes, it'd be good to see her.  I should imagine a maternally-
<br>                 outraged gorilla could be a useful ally when it comes to the
<br>                 final scrap.
<br>
<br>[Footsteps are heard outside the cell.]
<br>
<br>BA               Prepare to die like a man, Baldrick.
<br>
<br>[Baldrick stands.]
<br>
<br>BA               Or as close as you can come to a man without actually
<br>                 shaving the palms of your hands.
<br>
<br>[The door opens and Oberleutnant von Gerhardt enters.]
<br>
<br>von Gerhardt     Good evening.  I am Oberleutnant von Gerhardt.  I have
<br>                 a message from the Baron von Richthoven, the greatest living
<br>                 German.
<br>
<br>BA               Which, considering that his competition consists entirely
<br>                 of very fat men in leather shorts burping to the tune of
<br>                 `She'll Be Coming Round The Mountain', is no great
<br>                 achievement.
<br>
<br>von Gerhardt     Quiet!
<br>
<br>[von Gerhardt slaps Baldrick across the face.  Baldrick falls against the
<br> wall.]
<br>
<br>BA               And what is your message?
<br>
<br>von Gerhardt     It is: Prepare for a fate worse than death, English flying
<br>                 fellow.
<br>
<br>BA               Oh.  So, it's the traditional warm German welcome.
<br>
<br>von Gerhardt     Correct.  Also, he is saying: Do not try to escape or you
<br>                 will suffer even worse.
<br>
<br>BA               A fate worse than a fate worse than death?  Sounds pretty bad.
<br>
<br>
<br>Scene 11: Captain Darling's Office
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>[George and Darling are arguing loudly, there is confused chatter.]
<br>
<br>George           Yes well, you see, it's all very well for you, isn't it,
<br>                 sitting here behind yer, behind yer, behind yer comfy desk.
<br>
<br>Darling          Don't you take that tone with me, Lieutenant, or I'll have
<br>                 you on a charge for insurbordination.
<br>
<br>George           Well, I'd rather be on a charge for insubordination than on a
<br>                 charge of deserting a friend.
<br>
<br>Darling          How dare you talk to me like that!
<br>
<br>George           How dare I . . .?
<br>
<br>[General Melchett, attracted by the noise, enters from his office.]
<br>
<br>Melchett         Now, then, now then, now, now, then, now then, now then,
<br>                 then now, now, now then.  What's going on here?
<br>
<br>Darling          That damn fool Blackadder has crashed his plane behind enemy
<br>                 lines, Sir.  This young idiot wants to go and try rescue him.
<br>                 It's a total waste of men and equipment.
<br>
<br>George           He's not a damn fool, Sir, he's a bally hero.
<br>
<br>Melchett         All right.  All right, all right, all right.  I'll deal with
<br>                 this, Darling.  Delicate touch needed, I fancy.
<br>
<br>[Melchett takes George over to the fireplace.]
<br>
<br>Melchett         Now, George.  Do you remember when I came down to visit you
<br>                 when you were a nipper for your sixth birthday?  You used to
<br>                 have a lovely little rabbit.  Beautiful little thing.  Do you
<br>                 remember?
<br>
<br>George           Flossy.
<br>
<br>Melchett         That's right.  Flossy.  Do you remember what happened to
<br>                 Flossy?
<br>
<br>George           You shot him.
<br>
<br>Melchett         That's right.  It was the kindest thing to do after he'd been
<br>                 run over by that car.
<br>
<br>George           By your car, Sir.
<br>
<br>Melchett         Yes, by my car.  But that too was an act of mercy when you
<br>                 would remember that that dog had been set on him.
<br>
<br>George           Your dog, Sir.
<br>
<br>Melchett         Yes, yes, my dog.  But what I'm trying to say, George, is
<br>                 that the state young Flossy was in after we'd scraped him off
<br>                 my front tyre is very much the state that young Blackadder
<br>                 will be in now.  If not very nearly dead, then very actually
<br>                 dead.
<br>
<br>George           Permission for lip to wobble, Sir?
<br>
<br>Melchett         Permission granted.
<br>
<br>[George's lips wobble.]
<br>
<br>Melchett         Stout fellow.
<br>
<br>George           But surely, Sir, you must allow me to at least try and save
<br>                 him.
<br>
<br>Melchett         No, George.  It would be as pointless as trying to teach a
<br>                 woman the value of a good, forward defensive stroke.  Besides,
<br>                 it would take a superman to get him out of there, not the
<br>                 kind of weed who blubs just because somebody gives him a slice
<br>                 of rabbit pie instead of birthday cake.
<br>
<br>George           Well, I suppose you're right, Sir.
<br>
<br>Melchett         Course I am.  Now let's talk about something more jolly,
<br>                 shall we?  Look, this is the amount of land we've
<br>                 recaptured since yesterday.
<br>
<br>[Melchett and George move over to the map table.]
<br>
<br>George           Oh, excellent.
<br>
<br>Melchett         Erm, what is the actual scale of this map, Darling?
<br>
<br>Darling          Erm, one-to-one, Sir.
<br>
<br>Melchett         Come again?
<br>
<br>Darling          Er, the map is actually life-size, Sir.  It's superbly
<br>                 detailed.  Look, look, there's a little worm.
<br>
<br>Melchett         Oh, yes.  So the actual amount of land retaken is?
<br>
<br>[Darling whips out a tape measure amd measures the table.]
<br>
<br>Darling          Excuse me, Sir.  Seventeen square feet, Sir.
<br>
<br>Melchett         Excellent.  So you see, young Blackadder didn't die horribly
<br>                 in vain after all.
<br>
<br>George           If he did die, Sir.
<br>
<br>Darling          Tch!
<br>
<br>Melchett         That's the spirit, George.  If nothing else works, then a
<br>                 total pig-headed unwillingness to look facts in the face
<br>                 will see us through.
<br>
<br>
<br>Scene 12: A German Prison Cell
<br>------------------------------
<br>
<br>[BA is seated.  Baldrick is sitting on the floor.  There is a jangling of
<br> keys, the cell door opens and the Red Baron enters.]
<br>
<br>von Richthoven   So!  I am the Red Baron von Richthoven and you are the two
<br>                 English flying aces responsible for the spilling of the
<br>                 precious German blood of many of my finest and my
<br>                 blondest friends.  I have waited many months to do this.
<br>
<br>[von Richthoven kisses BA on both cheeks.]
<br>
<br>BA               You may have been right, Balders.  Looks like we're going
<br>                 to get rogered to death after all.
<br>
<br>Baldrick         Do you want me to go first, Sir?
<br>
<br>[von Richthoven laughs.]
<br>
<br>von Richthoven   You English and your sense of humour.  During your brief
<br>                 stay I look forward to learning more of your wit, your
<br>                 punning and your amusing jokes about the breaking of the wind.
<br>
<br>BA               Well, Baldrick's the expert there.
<br>
<br>Baldrick         I certainly am, Sir.
<br>
<br>[von Richthoven laughs.]
<br>
<br>von Richthoven   How lucky you English are to find the toilet so amusing.
<br>                 For us, it is a mundane and functional item.  For you, the
<br>                 basis of an entire culture.
<br>
<br>[Baldrick laughs, von Richthoven slaps him in the face.]
<br>
<br>von Richthoven   I must now tell you of the full horror of what awaits you.
<br>
<br>BA               Ah, you see, Balders.  Dress it up in any amount of pompous
<br>                 verbal diarrhoea, and the message is `Squareheads down for
<br>                 the big Boche gang-bang'.
<br>
<br>von Richthoven   As an officer and a gentleman, you will be looking forward
<br>                 to a quick and noble death.
<br>
<br>BA               Well, obviously.
<br>
<br>von Richthoven   But, instead, an even worse fate awaits you.  Tomorrow, you
<br>                 will be taken back to Germany . . .
<br>
<br>BA               Here it comes!
<br>
<br>von Richthoven   . . . to a convent school, outside Heidelberg, where you will
<br>                 spend the rest of the war teaching the young girls home
<br>                 economics.
<br>
<br>BA               Er . . .
<br>
<br>von Richthoven   For you, as a man of honour, the humiliation will be
<br>                 unbearable.
<br>
<br>BA               Oh, I think you'll find we're tougher than you imagine.
<br>
<br>von Richthoven   Ha!  I can tell how much you are suffering by your long
<br>                 faeces.
<br>
<br>BA               We're not suffering too much to say `thank you'.  Thank you.
<br>                 Say `thank you', Baldrick.
<br>
<br>Baldrick         Thank you, Baldrick.
<br>
<br>[von Richthoven laughs.]
<br>
<br>von Richthoven   How amusing.  But now, forgive me.  I must take to the skies
<br>                 once again.  Very funny.  The noble Lord Flasheart still
<br>                 eludes me.
<br>
<br>BA               I think you'll find he's overrated.  Bad breath and . . .
<br>                 impotent, they say.
<br>
<br>[von Richthoven laughs.]
<br>
<br>von Richthoven   Sexual innuendo.
<br>
<br>[von Richthoven laughs.]
<br>
<br>von Richthoven   But enough of this.  As you say in England, I must fly.
<br>
<br>[von Richthoven laughs.]
<br>
<br>von Richthoven   Perhaps I will master this humour after all, ja?
<br>
<br>BA               I wouldn't be too optomistic.
<br>
<br>von Richthoven   Oh, and the little fellow, if you get lonely in the night,
<br>                 I'm in the old chateau.  There's no pressure.
<br>
<br>[von Richthoven starts to leave.  As he moves up the steps to the cell door
<br> he prat-falls and laughs.]
<br>
<br>von Richthoven   Prat-fall!
<br>
<br>[von Richthoven leaves the cell, laughing as he goes.]
<br>
<br>Baldrick         Is it really true, Sir?  Is the war really over for us?
<br>
<br>BA               Yup!  Out of the war and teaching nuns how to boil eggs.
<br>                 For us, the Great War is finito.  A war that would be a damn
<br>                 sight simpler if we'd just stayed in England and shot fifty
<br>                 thousand of our men a week.  No more mud, death, rats, bombs,
<br>                 shrapnel, whizz-bangs, barbed wire and those bloody awful
<br>                 songs that have the word `whoops' in the title.
<br>
<br>[BA notices that the cell door has been left ajar.]
<br>
<br>BA               Oh, damn!  He's, he's left the door open.
<br>
<br>Baldrick         Oh, good!  We can escape, Sir.
<br>
<br>BA               Are you mad, Baldrick?  I'll find someone to lock it for us.
<br>
<br>[BA opens the door to find George standing there.]
<br>
<br>George           Ssh!  Keep-ee!  Mum's the word!  Not 'arf, or what?
<br>
<br>[BA shuts the door in George's face.]
<br>
<br>Baldrick         Sir, why did you just slam the door on Lieutenant George?
<br>
<br>BA               I can't believe it.  Go away!
<br>
<br>[George pushes the door open and enters the cell.]
<br>
<br>George           It's me.  It's me.
<br>
<br>BA               But what the hell are you doing here?
<br>
<br>George           Oh, never mind the hows, and the whys and the do-you-mind-
<br>                 if-I-don'ts.
<br>
<br>BA               But it would have taken a superman to get in here.
<br>
<br>George           Well, it's funny you should say that, because as it
<br>                 happens I did have some help from a rather spiffing bloke.
<br>                 He's taken a break from some crucial top-level shagging.
<br>
<br>[Flasheart smashes through the cell door, swinging on a rope.  As he lands,
<br> he trumpets his own arrival.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        It's me.  Hurray!
<br>
<br>George and Baldrick
<br>                 Hurray!
<br>
<br>[Flasheart smashes Baldrick in the face.  Baldrick falls to the floor.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        God's potatoes, George.  You said noble brother friars were
<br>                 in the lurch.  If I'd known you meant old Slack Bladder and
<br>                 the mound of the hound of the Baskervilles, I'd probably
<br>                 have let them stew in their own juice.
<br>
<br>[Baldrick rises.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        And let me tell you, if I ever tried that, I'd probably
<br>                 drown.
<br>
<br>[Baldrick laughs.  Flasheart laughs and smacks Baldrick in the face.
<br> Baldrick wings floor-ward again.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Still, since I'm here, I may as well do-oo it, as the
<br>                 Bishop said to the netball team.  Come on, chums!
<br>
<br>[Flasheart runs out of the cell, followed by George and Baldrick.  BA sits
<br> down and begins to moan, faking an injury.]
<br>
<br>BA               Aah!  Ow!  Aah!
<br>
<br>[Flasheart runs back into the cell, followed by George and Baldrick.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Come on.
<br>
<br>BA               Yes, yes.  Look, I'm sorry, chaps, but I've splintered my
<br>                 pancreas.  Erm, and I seem to have this terrible cough.
<br>
<br>[BA fakes a couple of coughs.]
<br>
<br>BA               Coff-guards!  Coff-guards!
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.  Now I may be
<br>                 packing the kind of tackle that you'd normally expect to find
<br>                 swinging about between the hindlegs of a Grand National
<br>                 winner, but I'm not totally stupid, and I've got the kind of
<br>                 feeling you'd rather we hadn't come.
<br>
<br>BA               No, no, no, I'm very grateful.  It's just that I'd slow you
<br>                 up.
<br>
<br>Flasheart        I think I'm beginning to understand.
<br>
<br>BA               Are . . . are you?
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Just because I can give multiple orgasms to the furniture
<br>                 just by sitting on it, doesn't mean that I'm not sick of this
<br>                 damn war: the blood, the noise, the endless poetry.
<br>
<br>BA               Is that really what you think, Flasheart?
<br>
<br>[Flasheart whips out his pistol and threatens BA.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Course it's not what I think.  Now get out that door before
<br>                 I redecorate that wall an interesting new colour called
<br>                 `hint of brain'.
<br>
<br>BA               Excellent.  Well, that's clear.  Let's get back to that
<br>                 lovely war, then!
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Woof!
<br>
<br>George           Woof!
<br>
<br>Baldrick         Bark!
<br>
<br>[As the group moves to leave, von Richthoven appears at the cell door.]
<br>
<br>von Richthoven   Not so fast, Blackadder.
<br>
<br>BA               Oh, damn!  Foiled again!  What bad luck!
<br>
<br>[von Richthoven enters the cell.]
<br>
<br>von Richthoven   Ah, and the Lord Flasheart.  This is indeed an honour.
<br>                 Finally, the two greatest gentleman fliers in the world meet.
<br>                 Two men of honour, who have jousted together in the
<br>                 cloud-strewn glory of the skies, face to face at last.  How
<br>                 often I have rehearsed this moment of destiny in my dreams.
<br>                 The panoply to encapsulate the unspoken nobility of a
<br>                 comradeship.
<br>
<br>[Flasheart shoots von Richthoven.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        What a poof!  Come on!
<br>
<br>[All exit the cell, cheering.]
<br>
<br>
<br>Scene 13: Captain Darling's Office
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>[Darling is dusting the office door.  BA opens the door in Darling's face.]
<br>
<br>BA               Hello, Darling.
<br>
<br>[Darling retreats backwards towards his desk as BA enters.]
<br>
<br>Darling          Good Lord.  Captain Blackadder.  I thought, I thought you
<br>                 were . . .
<br>
<br>BA               Playing tennis?
<br>
<br>Darling          No.
<br>
<br>BA               Dead?
<br>
<br>Darling          Well, yes, unfortunately.
<br>
<br>BA               Well, I had a lucky escape.  No thanks to you.  This is a
<br>                 friend of mine.
<br>
<br>[Flasheart is standing on Darling's desk.  Darling turns around and finds
<br> himself staring at Flasheart's crotch.]
<br>
<br>Darling          Argh!
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Hi, creep.
<br>
<br>BA               Flasheart, this is Captain Darling.
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Captain Darling?  Funny name for a guy, isn't it?
<br>
<br>[Flasheart jumps down from the desk.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Last person I called `Darling' was pregnant twenty seconds
<br>                 later.  Hear you couldn't be bothered to help old Slacky
<br>                 here.
<br>
<br>Darling          Er, well, it . . . it wasn't quite that, Sir.  It's just
<br>                 that we weighed up the pros and cons, and decided it wasn't a
<br>                 reasonable use of our time and resources.
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Well, this isn't a reasonable use of my time and resources,
<br>                 but I'm going to do it anyway.
<br>
<br>Darling          What?
<br>
<br>Flasheart        This!
<br>
<br>[Flasheart head-butts Darling.  Darling groans and falls backwards across his
<br> desk.]
<br>
<br>Flasheart        All right, Slacky!  All right, Slacky!  I've got to fly.
<br>                 Two million chicks, only one Flasheart.  And remember, if
<br>                 you want something, take it.  Bobby!
<br>
<br>[Bobby enters the office and salutes.]
<br>
<br>Bobby            My Lord!
<br>
<br>Flasheart        I want something!
<br>
<br>Bobby            Take it!
<br>
<br>Flasheart        Woof!
<br>
<br>[Bobby starts to unbutton her top as she leaves the office, followed by
<br> Flasheart.]
<br>
<br>BA               Git!
<br>
<br>[General Melchett enters from his office.]
<br>
<br>Melchett         Ah, Blackadder.  So you escaped.
<br>
<br>BA               Yes, Sir.
<br>
<br>Melchett         Bravo!
<br>
<br>[Melchett notices the unconcious Darling.]
<br>
<br>Melchett         Don't slouch, Darling.
<br>
<br>BA               I was wondering whether, having been tortured by the most
<br>                 vicious sadist in the German army, I might be allowed a
<br>                 week's leave to recuperate, Sir.
<br>
<br>Melchett         Excellent idea.  Your commanding officer would have to be
<br>                 stark raving mad to refuse you.
<br>
<br>BA               Well, you are my commanding officer.
<br>
<br>Melchett         Well?
<br>
