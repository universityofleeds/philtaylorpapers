<br>
<br>
<br>[The dugout. Blackadder is sitting in a chair reading a book. A record is
<br>playing softly. Scratching noises are heard.]
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Baldrick, what are you doing out there?
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       I'm carving something on this bullet sir.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     What are you carving?
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       I'm carving "Baldrick", sir.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Why?
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       It's a cunning plan actually.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Of course it is.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       You see, you know they say that somewhere there's a bullet
<br>                with your name on it?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Yes?
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       Well, I thought if I owned the bullet with my name on it,
<br>                I'd never get hit by it, 'cos I won't ever shoot myself.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Oh, shame.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       And, the chances of there being two bullets with my name
<br>                on them are very small indeed.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     That's not the only thing around here that's "very small
<br>                indeed". Your brain for example, is so minute, Baldrick,
<br>                that if a hungry cannibal cracked your head open there
<br>                wouldn't be enough inside to cover a small water-biscuit.
<br>
<br>                [George enters.]
<br>
<br>George:         Tally-ho pip-pip and Bernard's your uncle.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     In English we say, "Good Morning".
<br>
<br>George:         Look what I got for you sir.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     What?
<br>
<br>George:         It's the latest issue of "King & Country". Oh, damn
<br>                inspiring stuff; the magazine that tells the Tommies the
<br>                truth about the war.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Or alternatively, the greatest work of fiction since vows
<br>                of fidelity were included in the French marriage service.
<br>                [flicks through paper]
<br>
<br>George:         Come, come, sir, now. You can't deny that this fine
<br>                newspaper is good for the morale of the men.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Certainly not, I just think that more could be achieved by
<br>                giving them some real toilet-paper. [hands paper back to
<br>                George]
<br>
<br>George:         Not with you at all sir, what could any patriotic chap
<br>                have against this magnificent mag?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Apart from his bottom?
<br>
<br>George:         Yes.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Well look at it. [takes the paper again] I mean the
<br>                stuff's about as convincing as Dr. Crippen's defence
<br>                lawyer. The British Tommies are all portrayed as six foot
<br>                six with biceps the size of Bournemouth.
<br>
<br>George:         Thoroughly inspiring stuff. And look sir, this also
<br>                arrived for you this morning. [hands paper bag to
<br>                Blackadder]
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     [opening bag, taking out a revolver] Hmm, do you know what
<br>                this is, Lieutenant?
<br>
<br>George:         It's a good old service revolver.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Wrong. It's a brand new service revolver, which I've
<br>                suspiciously been sent without asking for it. I smell
<br>                something fishy, and I'm not talking about the contents of
<br>                Baldrick's apple crumble.
<br>
<br>George:         That's funny sir, because we didn't order those new
<br>                trench-climbing ladders either.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     New ladders?
<br>
<br>George:         Yeah, came yesterday. I issued them to the men, and they
<br>                were absolutely thrilled. [calls to Baldrick] Isn't that
<br>                right men?
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       [from the doorway] Yes sir, first solid fuel we've had
<br>                since we burned the cat.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Something's going on, and I think I can make an educated
<br>                guess what it is. Something which you, George, would find
<br>                hard to do. [they go outside into the trench]
<br>
<br>George:         Ah, true, true. Where I was at school, education could go
<br>                hang as long as a boy could hit a six, sing the school
<br>                song very loud, and take a hot crumpet from behind without
<br>                blubbing.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     I, on the other hand, am a fully rounded human being with
<br>                a degree from the university of life, a diploma from the
<br>                school of hard knocks, and three gold stars from the
<br>                kindergarten of getting the shit kicked out of me. My
<br>                instincts lead me to deduce that we are at last about to
<br>                go over the top. [peers over the top of the trench with a
<br>                periscope]
<br>
<br>George:         Great Scott sir, you mean, you mean the moment's finally
<br>                arrived for us to give Harry Hun a darned good British
<br>                style thrashing, six of the best, trousers down?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     If you mean, "Are we all going to get killed?" Yes.
<br>                Clearly, Field Marshal Haig is about to make yet another
<br>                gargantuan effort to move his drinks cabinet six inches
<br>                closer to Berlin.
<br>
<br>George:         Right! Bravo-issimo! Well let's make a start eh, up and
<br>                over to glory, last one in Berlin's a rotten egg.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Give me your helmet, lieutenant.
<br>
<br>                [George hands his helmet to Blackadder, who throws it up
<br>                into the sky. Immediately heavy machine-gun fire is heard.
<br>                He catches the helmet, which now has over 20 holes in it,
<br>                and gives it back to George.]
<br>
<br>George:         Yes, some sort of clever hat-camouflage might be in order.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       Permission to speak sir.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Granted, with a due sense of exhaustion and dread.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       I have a cunning plan to get us out of getting killed sir.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Ah yes, what is it?
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       Cooking.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     I see. [enters the dugout again]
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       You know staff HQ is always on the lookout for good cooks?
<br>                Well, we go over there, we cook 'em something, and get out
<br>                of the trenches that way.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Baldrick, it's a brilliant plan.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       Is it?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Yes, it's superb.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       [delighted] Permission to write home immediately sir, this
<br>                is the first brilliant plan a Baldrick's ever had! For
<br>                centuries we've tried, and they've always turned out to be
<br>                total pig-swill. My mother will be as pleased as Punch.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Hm-hm, if only she were as good-looking as Punch,
<br>                Baldrick. There is however one slight flaw in the plan.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       Oh?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     You're the worst cook in the entire world.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       Oh yeah, that's right.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     There are amoeba on Saturn who can boil a better egg than
<br>                you. Your Filet Mignon in sauce Bernaise look like
<br>                dog-turds in glue.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       That's because they are.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Your plum-duff tastes like it's a molehill decorated with
<br>                rabbit-droppings.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       I thought you wouldn't notice.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Your cream custard has the texture of cat's vomit.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       Again it's.....
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     If you were to serve one of your meals in staff HQ you'd
<br>                be arrested for the greatest mass poisoning since Lucretia
<br>                Borgia invited 500 of her close friends around for a
<br>                wine-and-anthrax party. No, we'll have to think of a
<br>                better plan than that.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       Right, how about a nice meal, while you chew it over?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     [suspicious] What's on the menu?
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       Rat. [shows him a big black rat] Saute or fricassee.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     [peers at the rat] Oh, the agony of choice. Saute
<br>                involves...?
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       Well, you take the freshly shaved rat, and you marinade it
<br>                in a puddle for a while.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Hmm, for how long?
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       Until it's drowned. Then you stretch it out under a hot
<br>                light bulb, then you get within dashing distance of the
<br>                latrine, and then you scoff it right down.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     So that's sauteing, and fricasseeing?
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       Exactly the same, just a slightly bigger rat.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Well, call me Old Mr. Un-adventurous but I think I'll give
<br>                it a miss this once.
<br>
<br>                [George enters, wearing a new hat decorated with
<br>                barbed-wire.]
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       Fair enough sir, more for the rest of us.
<br>                [to George] Eh sir?
<br>
<br>George:         Absolutely, Private. Tally-ho BARF BARF.
<br>
<br>                [The telephone rings, Blackadder picks it up.]
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Hello, the Savoy Grill. Oh, it's you..... yes..... yes,
<br>                I'll be over in 40 minutes.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       Who was it then sir?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Strangely enough Baldrick, it was Pope Gregory IX,
<br>                inviting me for drinks aboard his steam-yacht "The Saucy
<br>                Sue", currently wintering in Montego Bay with the England
<br>                Cricket team and the Balinese goddess of plenty.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       Really?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     No, not really. I'm ordered to HQ. No doubt that idiot
<br>                General Melchett is about to offer me some attractive new
<br>                opportunities to have my brains blown out for Britain.
<br>
<br>                              ---------------
<br>
<br>[At staff HQ. Darling is at his desk writing; Blackadder enters.]
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     What do you want, Darling?
<br>
<br>Darling:        It's Captain Darling to you. General Melchett wants to see
<br>                you about a highly important secret mission.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       [enters] What's going on, Darling?
<br>
<br>Darling:        Captain Blackadder to see you sir.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Ah, excellent. Just a short back and sides today I think,
<br>                please.
<br>
<br>Darling:        Er, that's Corporal Black, sir. Captain Blackadder is here
<br>                about the other matter sir, the [lowers his voice] secret
<br>                matter.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Ah, yes, the special mission. At ease Blackadder. Now,
<br>                what I'm about to tell you is absolutely tip-top-secret,
<br>                is that clear?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     It is sir.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Now, I've compiled a list of those with security
<br>                clearance, have you got it Darling?
<br>
<br>Darling:        Yes sir.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Read it please.
<br>
<br>Darling:        It's top security sir, I think that's all the Captain
<br>                needs to know.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Nonsense! Let's hear the list in full!
<br>
<br>Darling:        Very well sir. "List of personnel cleared for mission
<br>                Gainsborough, as dictated by General C. H. Melchett: You
<br>                and me, Darling, obviously. Field Marshal Haig, Field
<br>                Marshal Haig's wife, all Field Marshal Haig's wife's
<br>                friends, their families, their families' servants, their
<br>                families' servants' tennis partners, and some chap I
<br>                bumped into the mess the other day called Bernard."
<br>
<br>Melchett:       So, it's maximum security, is that clear?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Quite so sir, only myself and the rest of the English
<br>                speaking world is to know.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Good man. Now, Field Marshal Haig has formulated a
<br>                brilliant new tactical plan to ensure final victory in the
<br>                field. [they gather around a model of the battlefield]
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Now, would this brilliant plan involve us climbing out of
<br>                our trenches and walking slowly towards the enemy sir?
<br>
<br>Darling:        How can you possibly know that Blackadder? It's classified
<br>                information.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     It's the same plan that we used last time, and the
<br>                seventeen times before that.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       E-E-Exactly! And that is what so brilliant about it! We
<br>                will catch the watchful Hun totally off guard! Doing
<br>                precisely what we have done eighteen times before is
<br>                exactly the last thing they'll expect us to do this time!
<br>                There is however one small problem.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     That everyone always gets slaughtered the first ten
<br>                seconds.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       That's right! And Field Marshal Haig is worried that this
<br>                may be depressing the men a tadge. So, he's looking to
<br>                find a way to cheer them up.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Well, his resignation and suicide would seem the obvious
<br>                solution.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Interesting thought. Make a note of it, Darling! Take a
<br>                look at this: "King & Country".
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Ah, yes, without question my favourite magazine; soft,
<br>                strong and thoroughly absorbent.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Top-hole Blackadder, I thought it would be right up your
<br>                alley. Now, Field Marshal Haig's plan is this; to
<br>                commission a man to do an especially stirring painting for
<br>                the cover of the next issue, so as to really inspire the
<br>                men for the final push. What I want you to do, Blackadder,
<br>                is to labour night and day to find a first rate artist
<br>                from amongst your men.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Impossible sir. I know from long experience that my men
<br>                have all the artistic talent of a cluster of colourblind
<br>                hedgehogs... in a bag.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Hm, well that's a bit of a blow. We needed a man to leave
<br>                the trenches immediately.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Leave the trenches?
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Yes.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Yes, I wonder if you've enjoyed, as I have sir, that
<br>                marvellous painting in the National Portrait Gallery, "Bag
<br>                Interior", by the colourblind hedgehog workshop of Sienna.
<br>
<br>Darling:        I'm sorry, are you saying you can find this man?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     I think I can. And might I suggest sir that having left
<br>                the trenches, it might be a good idea to post our man to
<br>                Paris [points on Melchett's map], in order to soak up a
<br>                little of the artistic atmosphere. Perhaps even Tahiti
<br>                [points], so as to produce a real masterpiece.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Yes, yes, but can you find the man?!
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Now I know I can sir. Before you say "Sunflowers" I'll
<br>                have Vincent van Gogh standing before you.
<br>
<br>                              ---------------
<br>
<br>[Back in the trenches. Blackadder is painting, George is looking over his
<br>shoulder.]
<br>
<br>George:         No, don't stop sir. It's coming, it's definitely coming.
<br>                I, hm, yeah, ah, er, hm. I just wonder if two socks and a
<br>                hand-grenade is really the sort of thing that covers of
<br>                "King & Country" are made of.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     They will be when I painted them being shoved up the
<br>                Kaiser's backside.
<br>
<br>                [George walks over to Baldrick.]
<br>
<br>George:         Ah, now, now this is interesting.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     What is?
<br>
<br>George:         Well, Private Baldrick is obviously some kind of an
<br>                impressionist.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     The only impression he can do is of a man with no talent.
<br>                What's it called Baldrick? "The Vomiting Cavalier"?
<br>
<br>George:         That's not supposed to be vomit; it's dabs of light.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       No, it's vomit.
<br>
<br>George:         Yes, now er, why did you choose that?
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       You told me to sir.
<br>
<br>George:         Did I?
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       Yeah, you told me to paint whatever comes from within, so
<br>                I did my breakfast. Look, there's a little tomato.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Hopeless. If only I'd paid attention in nursery art-class
<br>                instead of spending my entire time manufacturing
<br>                papier-mache willies to frighten Sarah Wallis.
<br>
<br>George:         You know it's funny, but painting was the only thing I was
<br>                ever any good at.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Well, it's a pity you didn't keep it up.
<br>
<br>George:         Well, as a matter of fact I did, actually. I mean [takes
<br>                out pictures] I mean normally I hadn't thought I would
<br>                show them to anyone, because they're just embarrassing
<br>                daubs really, but you know, ah, they give me pleasure. I'm
<br>                embarrassed to show them to you now as it happens, but
<br>                there you go, for what they're worth. To be honest, I
<br>                should have my hands cut off, I mean...
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     George! These are brilliant! Why didn't you tell us about
<br>                these before?
<br>
<br>George:         Well you know, one doesn't want to blow one's own trumpet.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     You might at least have told us you had a trumpet. These
<br>                paintings could spell my way out of the trenches.
<br>
<br>George:         Yours?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     That's right, ours. All you have to do is paint something
<br>                heroic to appeal to the simple-minded Tommy. Over to you
<br>                Baldrick.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       How about a noble Tommy, standing with a look of horror
<br>                and disgust over the body of a murdered nun, what's been
<br>                done over by a nasty old German.
<br>
<br>George:         Excellent. I, I can see it now; "The Nun and the Hun".
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Brilliant! No time to lose. George, set up your easel,
<br>                Baldrick and I will pose. This is going to be art's
<br>                greatest moment since Mona Lisa sat down and told Leonardo
<br>                da Vinci she was in a slightly odd mood. Baldrick, you lie
<br>                down in the mud and be the nun.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       I'm not lying down there, it's all wet.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Well, let's put it this way; either you lie down and get
<br>                wet, or you're knocked down and get a broken nose.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       Actually it's not that wet, is it?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     No. [pushes Baldrick down, splat]
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       Who are you going to be then sir? The noble Tommy?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Precisely, standing over the body of the ravaged nun.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       I want a wimple.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     You should have gone before we started the picture.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       You know, the funny thing is, my father was a nun.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     [firmly] No he wasn't.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       He was so, sir. I know, 'cos whenever he was up in court,
<br>                and the judge used to say "occupation", he'd say "nun".
<br>
<br>                [George enters, dressed in painter's smock and hat,
<br>                carrying a palette and easel.]
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Right. [to George] You're ready?
<br>
<br>George:         Just about sir, yes. Erm, if you just like to pop your
<br>                clothes on the stool.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     I'm sorry?
<br>
<br>George:         Just pop your clothes on the stool over there.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     You mean, you want me... tackle out?
<br>
<br>George:         Well, I would prefer so sir, yes.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     If I can remind you of the realities of battle George, one
<br>                of the first things that everyone notices is that all the
<br>                protagonists have got their clothes on. Neither we, nor
<br>                the Hun, favour fighting our battles "au naturel".
<br>
<br>George:         Sir, it's artistic licence. It's willing suspension of
<br>                disbelief.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Well, I'm not having anyone staring in disbelief at my
<br>                willie suspension. Now, get on and paint the bloody thing,
<br>                sharpish!
<br>
<br>                              ---------------
<br>
<br>[Later. The painting is ready.]
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Brilliant George, it's a masterpiece. The wimple suits you
<br>                Baldrick.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       But it completely covers my face.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Exactly. Now then, General Melchett will be here at any
<br>                moment. When he arrives, leave the talking to me, all
<br>                right? I like to keep an informal trench, as you know, but
<br>                today you must only speak with my express permission, is
<br>                that clear? [sharply] Is that clear?
<br>                [With a note of regret] Permission to speak.
<br>
<br>George:       \ Yes sir, absolutely.
<br>Baldrick:     / Yes sir.
<br>
<br>Darling:        [outside] Attention! [entering] Dugout, attention!
<br>
<br>                [Melchett enters.]
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Excellent, at ease. Now then Blackadder, where would you
<br>                like me to sit? I thought just a simple trim of the
<br>                moustache today, nothing drastic.
<br>
<br>Darling:        We're here about the painting sir.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Oh, yes, of course. [seeing George] Good Lord, George,
<br>                hahahaaa, how are you my boy? [nothing] I said how are
<br>                you?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Permission to speak.
<br>
<br>George:         Absolutely top-hole sir, with a ying and a yang and a
<br>                yippetty-doo.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Splendid! And your uncle Bertie sends his regards. I told
<br>                him you could have a week off in April; we don't want you
<br>                missing the Boat Race, do we?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Permission to speak.
<br>
<br>George:         Certainly not. Permission to sing boisterously sir?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     If you must.
<br>
<br>George:         Row, row, row your boat,
<br>
<br>Melchett:       [joins in] gently down the stream. Belts off, trousers
<br>                down, isn't life a scream. HAI!
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Fabulous, university education, you can't beat it.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Bravo, now [moving on to Baldrick] what have we here?
<br>                Name?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Permission to speak.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       Baldrick, sir.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Ah, tally-ho, yippety-dip, and zing zang spillip. Looking
<br>                forward to bullying off for the final chukka?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Permission to speak.
<br>
<br>                [Silence.]
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Answer the General Baldrick.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       I can't answer him sir, I don't know what he's talking
<br>                about.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Aah, are you looking forward to the big push? [pinches
<br>                Baldrick's cheek]
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       No sir, I'm absolutely terrified. [pinces Melcett's]
<br>
<br>Melchett:       The healthy humour of the honest Tommy. Hahaaa, don't
<br>                worry my boy, if you should falter, remember that Captain
<br>                Darling and I are behind you.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     About thirty-five miles behind you.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Right, well stand by your beds. Let's have a look at this
<br>                artist of yours, Blackadder. Next to me, Darling.
<br>
<br>Darling:        Thank you sir. [sits down next to Melchett]
<br>
<br>Melchett:       So, ah, have you found someone?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Yes sir, I think I have; none other than young George
<br>                here.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Oh, bravo. Well, let's have a shufti then.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     This is called "War". [shows his own painting]
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Damn silly title George. Looks more like a couple of his
<br>                socks and a stick of pineapple to me.
<br>
<br>George:         Ah, permission to speak sir?!
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Er, I think not actually.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Quite right, if what happens when you open your mouth is
<br>                anything like what happens when you open your paintbox,
<br>                we'd all be drenched in phlegm. Oh no, this isn't what
<br>                we're looking for at all, is it Darling?
<br>
<br>Darling:        No sir.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       No sir!
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     There is this sir, it's Private Baldrick's, [shows
<br>                painting] he's called it "My family and other animals".
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Oh, good Lord no.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Well, I'm afraid that's about it sir. Apart from ... this
<br>                little thing. [show George's painting]
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Ah, now, that's more like it!
<br>
<br>Darling:        Who painted this Blackadder?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Well actually it was me.
<br>
<br>George:         Permission to speak, really quite urgently sir!
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Damn and blast your goggly eyes! Will you stop
<br>                interrupting, George! Now, this is excellent! [shakes
<br>                Blackadder's hand] Congratulations man! It's totally
<br>                inspiring, makes you want to jump over the top and yell
<br>                "Yah-boo sucks to you, Fritsie".
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Thank you sir.
<br>
<br>Darling:        Are you sure you did this, Blackadder?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Of course I'm sure.
<br>
<br>Darling:        I'm afraid I don't believe you.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     How dare you Darling!? [to Melchett] You know I can't let
<br>                that slur pass, sir... What possible low, suspicious,
<br>                slanderous reasons could this "office-boy" have to think
<br>                that I didn't paint the picture?
<br>
<br>Darling:        Well, three reasons as a matter of fact. Firstly: you're
<br>                in it.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     It's a self-portrait.
<br>
<br>Darling:        Secondly: you told us you couldn't paint.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Well, one doesn't want to blow one's own trumpet.
<br>
<br>George:         Permission...
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Denied.
<br>
<br>Darling:        And thirdly: it's signed "George".
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     [walks over to painting, looks closely at corner] Well
<br>                spotted. But not signed "George", dedicated "to George",
<br>                King George. Gentlemen; The King!
<br>
<br>All:            [snapping to attention] The King!
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       Where?
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Bravo Blackadder, I have absolutely no hesitation in
<br>                appointing you our official regimental artist. You're a
<br>                damn fine chap, not a pen-pushing, desk-sucking,
<br>                blotter-jotter like Darling here, eh Darling?
<br>
<br>Darling:        No sir.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       No sir! Well, accompany us back to HQ immediately.
<br>
<br>Darling:        Attention!
<br>
<br>                [Melchett and Darling exit.]
<br>
<br>George:         Permission to jolly well speak right now sir, otherwise I
<br>                might just burst like a bally balloon.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Later George. Much later.
<br>
<br>                              ---------------
<br>
<br>[At Headquarters.]
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Congratulations on your new appointment, Blackadder.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Thank you sir.
<br>
<br>Darling:        And may I say Blackadder, I'm particularly pleased about
<br>                it.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Are you.
<br>
<br>Darling:        [smugly] Oh yes.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Now that you are our official war-artist, we can give you
<br>                the full briefing. The fact is, Blackadder, that the "King
<br>                & Country" cover story was just a... cover story. We want
<br>                you, as our top painting bod, to leave the trenches...
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Good.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Tonight...
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Suits me.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       And go out into no-man's-land.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     No-man's-land.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Yeeeeeees.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Not Paris.
<br>
<br>Melchett and Darling:
<br>                Noooooooo.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       We want you to come back with accurate drawings of the
<br>                enemy positions.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     You want me to sit in no-man's-land, painting pictures of
<br>                the Germans.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Precisely! Good man!
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Well, it's a very attractive proposition, gentlemen, but
<br>                unfortunately not practical. You see, my medium is light.
<br>                It'll be pitch dark; I won't be able to see a thing.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Ah, hm, that is a point. I tell you what: we'll send up a
<br>                couple of flares. You'll be lit up like a Christmas tree.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Oh, excellent, excellent, glad I checked.
<br>
<br>                              ---------------
<br>
<br>[Blackadder, Baldrick and George crawling across no-man's-land.]
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     All right, total and utter quiet, do you understand? So
<br>                for instance if any of us crawl over any barbed wire they
<br>                must on no account goaaAAAAAAAAAAHH!
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       Have you just crawled over some barbed wire sir?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     No Baldrick, I just put my elbow in a blob of ice cream.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       Oh, that's all right then.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Now, where the hell are we?
<br>
<br>George:         Well, it's difficult to say, we appear to have crawled
<br>                into an area marked with mushrooms.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     [patiently] What do those symbols denote?
<br>
<br>George:         Pfff. That we're in a field of mushrooms?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Lieutenant, that is a military map, it is unlikely to list
<br>                interesting flora and fungi. Look at the key and you'll
<br>                discover that those mushrooms aren't for picking.
<br>
<br>George:         Good Lord, you're quite right sir, it says "mine". So,
<br>                these mushrooms must belong to the man who made the map.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Either that, or we're in the middle of a mine-field.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       Oh dear.
<br>
<br>George:         So, he owns the field as well?
<br>
<br>                [Machine-guns fire.]
<br>
<br>George:         [yelling] THEY'RE FIRING SIR, THEY'RE FIRING.
<br>
<br>                [The guns stop.]
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Ah yes, thank you Lieutenant. If they hit me you'll be
<br>                sure to point it out, won't you. Now come on, get on with
<br>                your drawing and let's get out of here.
<br>
<br>George:         Well, surely we ought to wait for the flare sir? You see,
<br>                my medium is light.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Just use your imagination for heavens sake. [thinks] Wait
<br>                a minute, that's the answer. I can't believe I've been so
<br>                stupid.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       Yeah, that is unusual, 'cos usually I'm the stupid one.
<br>
<br>George:         Well, I'm not over-furnished in the brain department.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Well, on this occasion I've been stupidest of all.
<br>
<br>George:         Oh, now sir! I will not have that! Baldrick and I will
<br>                always be more stupid than you. Isn't that right Baldrick?
<br>                [standing up] Stupid, stupid, stupid.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       Yeah, [standing up also] stupidy, stupidy, stupidy.
<br>
<br>                [Flares are fired, lighting up George and Baldrick.
<br>                Blackadder cowers on the ground.]
<br>
<br>George:         Stupidest stupids in the whole history of stupidityness.
<br>
<br>                [Machine-gun fire; Baldrick and George jump down; the guns
<br>                stop.]
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Finished? I think the obvious point is this: we'll go
<br>                straight out to the dugout and do the painting from there.
<br>                You do the most imaginative, most exciting possible drawing
<br>                of German defences from your imagination.
<br>
<br>George:         Oh I see, now that is a challenge.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Quite. Come on, let's get out of here.
<br>
<br>George:         Oh sir, just one thing. If we should happen to tread on a
<br>                mine, what do we do?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Well, normal procedure, Lieutenant, is to jump 200 feet
<br>                into the air and scatter yourself over a wide area.
<br>
<br>                              ---------------
<br>
<br>[Back at Headquarters.]
<br>
<br>Darling:        Are you sure this is what you saw Blackadder?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Absolutely. I mean there may have been a few more armament
<br>                factories, and [looks sideways at George] not quite as
<br>                many elephants, but...
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Well, you know what this means...
<br>
<br>Darling:        If it's true sir, we'll have to cancel the push.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Exactly....
<br>
<br>George:         Damn!
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     What a nuisance...
<br>
<br>Melchett:       ...Exactly what the enemy would expect us to do, and
<br>                therefore exactly what we shan't do!
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Ah.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Now, if we attack where the line is strongest, then Fritz
<br>                will think that our reconnaissance is a total shambles.
<br>                This will lull him into a sense of false security, and
<br>                then next week we can attack where the line is actually
<br>                badly defended. And win the greatest victory since the
<br>                Winchester flower-arranging team beat Harrow by twelve
<br>                sore bottoms to one!
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Tell me, have you ever visited the planet Earth, sir?
<br>
<br>Melchett:       So, best fighting trousers on, Blackadder!
<br>
<br>George:         Permission to shout "Bravo" at an annoyingly loud volume
<br>                sir?
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Permission granted.
<br>
<br>George:         [annoyingly loud volume] BRAVO!!!!!!!!!!
<br>
<br>Melchett:       That's the spirit. Just your kind of caper eheh,
<br>                Blackadder?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Oh yes.
<br>
<br>Darling:        Good luck against those elephants...
<br>
<br>                [Blackadder and George salute and leave.]
<br>
<br>                              ---------------
<br>
<br>[In the dugout.]
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Get me a chisel and some marble Baldrick.
<br>
<br>George:         Oh, you're taking up sculpture now sir?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     No, I thought I'd get my headstone done.
<br>
<br>George:         What are you going to put on it?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     "Here lies Edmund Blackadder, and he's bloody annoyed."
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       Are we goin' over, are we sir?
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Yes, we are. Unless I can think of some brilliant plan.
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       Would you like some "rat-au-van" to help you think? [shows
<br>                Blackadder a tin plate with a very flat rat on it]
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     "Rat-au-vin"?
<br>
<br>Baldrick:       Yeah, it's rat that's been...
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     [joins in] ..run over by a van. No thank you Baldrick.
<br>                Although it gives me an idea. Telephone please.
<br>
<br>                              ---------------
<br>
<br>[Headquarters, later that night. Melchett and Darling are dining.]
<br>
<br>Darling:        I suppose Blackadder and his boys will have gone over the
<br>                top by now.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Yes. God, I wish I were out there with them, dodging the
<br>                bullets, instead of having to sit here drinking this
<br>                chateau Lafite, eating these Filets Mignon in sauce
<br>                Bernaise.
<br>
<br>Darling:        My thoughts exactly sir. Damn this Chateau Lafite.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       He's a very brave man, Blackadder. And of course that
<br>                Lieutenant of his, George, Cambridge man you know. His
<br>                uncle Bertie and I used to break wind for our college.
<br>                Slightly unusual taste, this sauce Bernaise...
<br>
<br>Darling:        Yes sir, and to be quite frank, these mignon are a
<br>                little... well...
<br>
<br>Melchett:       What?
<br>
<br>Darling:        Well, dungy.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       What on earth's wrong with our cook?
<br>
<br>Darling:        Well, it's a rather strange story sir.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Oh? Tell, tell.
<br>
<br>Darling:        Well sir, I received a phonecall this afternoon from Pope
<br>                Gregory IX, telling me that our cook had been selected for
<br>                the England Cricket team and must set sail for the West
<br>                Indies immediately.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Really?
<br>
<br>Darling:        Then a moment later, the phone rang again. It was a trio of
<br>                wandering Italian chefs, who happened to be in the area,
<br>                offering their services. So I had the quartermaster take
<br>                them on at once.
<br>
<br>Melchett:       Ah, hm, Hm, HM , Ah, Oh, OH!! Jumping giblets! Are  you
<br>                sure these are real raisins in this plum-duff?
<br>
<br>Darling:        Oh yes, I'm sure they are sir. Everything will be alright,
<br>                once the cream custard arrives.
<br>
<br>                              ---------------
<br>
<br>[Back in the dugout. Blackadder, George and Baldrick enter, wearing cooks'
<br>aprons and huge black false moustaches. Baldrick is carrying a jug and a
<br>small kitten.]
<br>
<br>George:         Well all jolly good fun sir. But dash it all, we appear to
<br>                have missed the big push.
<br>
<br>Blackadder:     Oh damn, so we have. One thing puzzles me Baldrick; how did
<br>                you manage to get so much custard out of such a small cat?
<br>
<br>                              ---------------
