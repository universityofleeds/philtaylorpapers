<br>
<br>
<br>Soldiers of Iraq. Since the beginning of time, there has been no profession more honorable than that of a soldier. Soldiers are decorated with awards and medals that show their achievements and mark their skills. The uniform of a soldier is an article that demands respect, and loyalty. Soldiers are the defenders of their people, and the protectors of women and children. A soldier is willing to sacrifice himself for his country and their way of life. Soldiers sacrifice their own personal freedoms to protect others. 
<br>
<br>Saddam has tarnished this legacy. Saddam spews forth political rhetoric along with a false sense of national pride to deceive these men to serve his own unlawful purposes. Saddam does not wish the soldiers of Iraq to have the honor and dignity that their profession warrants. Saddam seeks only to exploit these brave men. Saddam uses the soldiers of Iraq not as protectors of the peace, but rather as his own personal bodyguards. 
<br>
<br>Do not let Saddam tarnish the reputation of soldiers any longer. Saddam uses the military to persecute those who don't agree with his unjust agenda. Make the decision. 
<br>
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>People of Iraq. Throughout the history of the world, mankind has shown a desire to progress and expand. Great leaders have built vast civilizations and empires that spanned continents. These leaders have sponsored education programs, paved vast roads, and built housing for the less fortunate. The leaders of the past have turned deserts into arable land, and created innovations which made life easier for their people. The great leaders of the past are known for their generosity and charity towards their own people, as well as their neighboring lands. In Afghanistan, once the Taliban was removed from power, the standard of living drastically improved. Relief aid is pouring into Afghanistan and is appropriately distributed. Schools are open and people all across Afghanistan are better off. 
<br>
<br>However, there have been leaders who were not moved by charity and good will. These leaders were motivated solely by greed and power. Josef Stalin was one such leader. Stalin was set on world domination, and it was his regime that began nearly a half-century of brutal domination through Eastern Europe. Stalin oppressed his people as he ruled over his country with an iron fist. During his reign as a dictator, Stalin killed and imprisoned millions of his own people. Millions of others were forcefully displaced and ended up living many miles away from their own homes. This dictator cared nothing for his own people, he merely sought to exploit them to perpetuate his regime and flawed ideology. 
<br>
<br>In the end, the world has paid a higher price for not stopping men like Stalin when they had the chance. Many millions of people have lost their lives needlessly under these oppressive regimes and in wars started by these leaders. The loss of life and the needless suffering could have been minimized had action been taken sooner. History has shown that appeasement of brutal domineering regimes only brings greater tragedy. Saddam too has a lust for power, and the world will stand up and put an end to the terror he imposes on others, before he destroys Iraq and crushes the hopes of its proud people. 
<br>
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>In a recent speech the President of the United States, George W. Bush, stated why America is determined to remove the regime of Saddam Hussein from power. He said: "&[Saddam Hussein] must not be permitted to threaten&the world with horrible poisons and diseases and gases and atomic weapons." 
<br>
<br>President Bush continued: " ...the [Iraqi] regime has produced thousands of tons of chemical agents, including mustard gas, sarin nerve gas, [and] VX nerve gas. The regime [has admitted] that it had produced more than 30,000 liters of anthrax and other deadly biological agents...Saddam Hussein&has ordered several chemical attacks on Iran and on more than forty villages in his own country. These actions killed or injured at least 20,000 people." 
<br>
<br>In addition, Saddam Hussein possesses missiles that can travel hundreds of kilometers  -  far enough to threaten your Arab neighbors and other nations. He is also increasing his numbers of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles that he can use to disperse chemical or biological weapons and kill thousands - as he has already done. 
<br>
<br>While there are many dangers in the world, the threat from Saddam Hussein is unique. He possesses the most deadly arms of our age and has not hesitated in the past to use them to destroy those he perceives as his enemies. His use of chemical weapons has been unprovoked, without restraint or modern precedent, and completely violates the conventions of war followed by every civilized country. 
<br>
<br>Saddam Hussein has already used chemical weapons on his fellow countrymen. The world community is working towards the halt of the proliferation of these weapons and asks for your support. 
<br>
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>Soldiers of Iraq. Saddam does not care for the military of Iraq. Saddam uses his soldiers as puppets, not for the glory of Iraq, but for his own personal glory. During the Gulf War, Saddam put his own soldiers out in the desert without supplies or support to stop the Coalition Forces who had expelled the Iraqi military from their illegal occupation of Kuwait. He also laid land mines to the rear of their positions. Not only did Saddam needlessly put you in harm's way against the Coalition forces, he also prevented your safe return. 
<br>
<br>Saddam also sacrificed thousands of soldiers during the Iran / Iraq war. Nearly 400,000 Iraqi soldiers were casualties of that war. Some of these men were even casualties of Saddam's own chemical and gas attacks. 60,000 Iraqis were taken prisoner during the conflict. When the Iraqi soldiers that were taken prisoner were returned, Saddam ordered their ears to be cut off as punishment for being captured. 
<br>
<br>Saddam has continued to order anti-aircraft artillery to fire at Coalition aircraft that patrol the United Nation's no fly zone. Due to his defiance of UN resolutions, many more soldiers have been put in harms way. 
<br>
<br>Saddam and his close associates live in lavish palaces and live above and beyond the law. Saddam lives like a king while his soldiers are underpaid, and under equipped. 
<br>
<br>How much longer will this incompetent leader be allowed to rule? How many more soldiers is he willing to sacrifice? Will your unit be the next one to be sacrificed? When will the Iraqi Army become a legitimate army of the people and not serve as bodyguards for Saddam's Regime? 
<br>
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>People of Iraq. The standard of living for Iraqis has dropped drastically since Saddam came into power. Every night, children go to sleep hungry in Iraq. The sick suffer from ailments that are easily treatable in the rest of the world. 
<br>
<br>Saddam has built palace after palace for himself and has purchased a fleet of luxury cars all at the expense of the Iraqi people. This money would be much better suited to build libraries and schools. This money would have gone a long way to provide better food and medicine for the people of Iraq. The amount of money Saddam spends on himself in one day would be more than enough to feed a family for a year. 
<br>
<br>The Oil for Food program was set up by the UN to provide relief aid to Iraqis who had fallen into poverty due to Saddam's leadership. Only 25 billion dollars out of the available 53 billion were ever applied for. Much of the food and equipment purchased under the Oil for Food program was stored away in warehouses, never to reach their destinations. Saddam illegally resold much of this equipment for his own profit. Saddam has exploited the Oil For Food program to illegally buy weapons and materials intended to produce nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and for lavish gifts for his elite regime members. 
<br>
<br>The countless pictures and billboards of Saddam that litter the landscape of Iraq do nothing to help the people of Iraq. Saddam has built monuments to promote his legacy at your expense. These lavish monuments serve as a constant reminder to the Iraqi people of money that would have been better spent on the welfare of the Iraqi people. 
<br>
<br>How much longer will this corrupt rule be allowed to exploit and oppress the Iraqi people? 
<br>
<br>People of Iraq. Recently, the representatives to the United Nations met to discuss a new resolution to deal with Iraq's disclosure of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. Representatives from these nations spoke both their concerns and praise of United Nations Security Council resolution 1441. 
<br>
<br>Richard Ryan, Ireland's representative, stated that the unanimous adoption of the resolution was a strong statement of the Council's unity. The resolution was about disarming Iraq without the use of force, which is considered a last resort. Iraq must, however, understand that it must disarm or face serious consequences. The purpose of the resolution was avoiding a military conflict and strengthening the role of the Security Council in the maintenance of peace and security. 
<br>
<br>Sergey Lavrov, the representative from the Russian Federation, said that it was of fundamental importance that there was clear confirmation in the resolution and that all members respected the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq. 
<br>
<br>Syria's representative, Fayssal Mekdad, stated that Syria had voted for the resolution in order to achieve unanimity in the Council and because of Syria's commitment to the United Nations Charter and international law. 
<br>
<br>Zhang Yishan, China's representative, and the President of the Security Council said his delegation voted in favor of the resolution, because it supported viewpoints that China had maintained during the negotiations, including a multilateral, diplomatic approach, and a way towards suspending and eventually lifting sanctions. He welcomed the efforts of international parties to break the deadlock on Iraq, and welcomed, as well, moves by Iraq to allow inspectors to return. He supported a practical inspection regime and called on all to fulfill their responsibilities in a fair and expedient manner. 
<br>
<br>Clearly, the world is set on a peaceful resolution to the growing threat Iraq presents to the region. The world can only hope that Saddam offers full compliance and accepts the generosity of the United Nations proposal. 
<br>
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>With the passage of UN Security Council Resolution 1441, the International Atomic Energy Agency, better known as the IAEA, has been mandated to conduct inspections in Iraq. The goal of the inspection program is to determine the extent of Saddam Hussein's nuclear weapons program with the aim of completing the disarmament process established by UN Security Council Resolution 687. 
<br>
<br>The International Atomic Agency Director, Dr. Mohamed el-Baradei, was born in Egypt in 1942. He gained a Bachelor's degree in Law in1962 at the University of Cairo, and a Doctorate in International Law at the New York School of Law in 1974. His career began with the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1964. In this position he served on two Permanent Missions of Egypt to the United Nations in New York and Geneva. Later, he also became a senior fellow in charge of the International Law Program at the United Nations Institute for Training and Research. He has also served as a senior member of the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) Secretariat, and as the Assistant Director General for External Relations. 
<br>
<br>Throughout his career as a diplomat, an international civil servant and scholar, Dr. el-Baradei has experienced the processes of international organizations, concentrating in the fields of international peace and security and international law making. He has lectured widely in the fields of international law, international organizations, arms control and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Further, he has devoted his career to studying and developing international laws. 
<br>
<br>Dr. el-Baradei has the knowledge, experience, and expertise to effectively lead the IAEA inspection teams. Some of the responsibilities and authorities granted to the IAEA and Dr. el-Baradei under U.N. Security Council Resolution 1441 include determining the composition of inspection teams and unrestricted rights of entry in and out of Iraq. The IAEA inspection teams will have unconditional, unrestricted access to any sites of concern and the names of all personnel currently and formerly associated with chemical, biological, nuclear, and ballistic programs. The resolution also gives Dr. el-Baradei the right to declare exclusion zones that suspend movement into and out of an inspection area. Further, the resolution gives the inspection teams the right to verifiably remove, destroy, or render harmless devices, records, or facilities that relate to prohibited weapons. 
<br>
<br>Any interference with Dr. el-Baradei's duties or the inspection teams will only delay a solution to end this crisis. Saddam and his regime can help end the pain and suffering of the people of Iraq, by complying with the tenets of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1441, which mandates compliance and non-interference with the IAEA. 
<br>

<br>
<br>United States defense officials reported on the biennial military exercise "Internal Look". The exercise moves the command and control elements of United States Central Command to the Middle East Region in order to test its readiness for deployment. Its operational concept is focused on joint battle staff war fighting at the strategic and operational level. According to GEN Franks, Central Command Commander, Internal Look is simply an exercise that "gives us the opportunity to deploy that command post. And the purpose of it is command, control, communications, to be sure that we have the right bandwidth lined up, to be sure that we can talk to our components-by that I mean air component, land component, maritime component and special-operations component." He also stated that: "over the last year Central Command has built a deployable command and control capability." And, "what that actually means is containers of communications gear, very large communications pipes that we're able put in the back of an airplane, fly it a long ways, land it on the ground and then set up a command-and-control complex." 
<br>
<br>The primary training audience is the United States Central Command Commander, General Tommy R. Franks, and his staff. The secondary training audience is composed of Central Command service and functional component commanders, their staffs and selected allied forces. Internal Look is Central Command's major Command Post Exercise and facilitates training the full battle staff for Central Command and its components. It also allows Third Army to exercise its deputy joint land forces command responsibilities. It has been an exercise conducted biennially since 1990. 
<br>
<br>This is the second time that Central Command has deployed into the Gulf Region. Just as in 1990, the exercise is testing Central Command's deployed command, control, and communication capabilities in the area. In the end exercise "Internal Look" promises to provide an excellent training opportunity that will ultimately prepare US/Coalition forces with the most highly trained force in the world.

<br>Dear Listeners, the following program is a re-broadcast of remarks given by President George W. Bush and United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan on the 8th of November 22, 2002, in the White House Oval office regarding the unanimous acceptance by the United Nations Security Council regarding U.N. Resolution 1441, and the return of weapons inspectors to Iraq. These remarks are being re-broadcast in their entirety. 
<br>
<br>THE PRESIDENT: The Secretary General and I are going to have some opening statements, only statements. First, I do want to welcome the Secretary General here. I'm grateful for your leadership at the United Nations. A while ago the United Nations Security Council made a very strong statement that we, the world, expects Saddam Hussein to disarm for the sake of peace. And the U.N. stepped up to its responsibilities, and I want to thank you for that, Mr. Secretary-General. I appreciate your leadership. 
<br>
<br>I'm looking forward to our discussion. Of course I'll remind the Secretary General that our war against terror is a war against individuals whose hearts are full of hate. We do not fight a religion. As a matter of fact, by far, the vast majority of American citizens respect the Islamic people and the Muslim faith. After all, there are millions of peaceful-loving Muslim Americans. 
<br>
<br>Some of the comments that have been uttered about Islam do not reflect the sentiments of my government or the sentiments of most Americans. Islam, as practiced by the vast majority of people, is a peaceful religion, a religion that respects others. Ours is a country based upon tolerance, Mr. Secretary General, and we respect the faith and we welcome people of all faiths in America. And we're not going to let the war on terror or terrorists cause us to change our values. And so, Mr. Secretary-General, I'm honored that you're here at the Oval Office. I'm proud to call you friend, and welcome. 
<br>
<br>THE SECRETARY GENERAL: Thank you very much, Mr. President. If I may comment on the last point you raised. I share your view entirely that every region and people of every faith have also been victims of terrorists. This is a scourge that affects all of us, regardless of region or religion. And we need to stand together to defeat terrorism. And this is where the work of the United Nations and effective implementation of this Resolution 1373 is absolutely crucial. We need to work to deprive terrorists of the opportunities by not giving them haven, by not giving them financial and logistical support. And I think the counterterrorism committee of the Security Council is doing a good job in trying to make sure we all work together on it. 
<br>
<br>With regards to the Iraq decision, I want to thank you, Mr. President, for working with the United Nations and the Council and working through the Council. And I remember when you came to the U.N. on the 12th of September; nobody knew which way you were going to go. And in my own speech before yours, I was pleading that we go the multilateral route. And I think we were all relieved that we did -- you did. 
<br>
<br>And I would want to say that the Council decision, which was unanimous, sent a powerful message that the entire international community would like to see the Security Council resolutions implemented. 
<br>
<br>Today I received a letter from the Iraqi government accepting the resolution, saying that they would work with the resolution. And Mr. Blix and his team will go back. We expect them to get there on the 18th and actively begin their work. This is a Chapter 7 resolution, and it must be implemented. 
<br>
<br>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, sir. Thank you, all. 
<br>
<br>Dear Listeners, once again the previous program was a re-broadcast of remarks given by President George W. Bush and United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan on the 8th of November 22, 2002, in the White House Oval office regarding the unanimous acceptance by the United Nations Security Council regarding U.N. Resolution 1441, and the return of weapons inspectors to Iraq. These remarks are being re-broadcast in their entirety. 
<br>
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>Dear listeners, the following program is a broadcast of the articles of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441, which was unanimously approved by the United Nations Security Council on November 8th, 2002. The intent of UNSCR 1441 is to provide Saddam Hussein's regime a final opportunity to comply with the disarmament obligations established by UNSCR 687, in 1991. The following are the articles of UNSCR 1441 in their entirety. 
<br>
<br>Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, 
<br>
<br>Decides that Iraq has been and remains in material breach of its obligations under relevant resolutions, including resolution 687 (1991), in particular through Iraq's failure to cooperate with United Nations inspectors and the IAEA, and to complete the actions required under paragraphs 8 to 13 of resolution 687 (1991); 
<br>Decides, while acknowledging paragraph 1 above, to afford Iraq, by this resolution, a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations under relevant resolutions of the Council; and accordingly decides to set up an enhanced inspection regime with the aim of bringing to full and verified completion the disarmament process established by resolution 687 (1991) and subsequent resolutions of the Council; 
<br>Decides that, in order to begin to comply with its disarmament obligations, in addition to submitting the required biannual declarations, the Government of Iraq shall provide to UNMOVIC, the IAEA, and the Council, not later than 30 days from the date of this resolution, a currently accurate, full, and complete declaration of all aspects of its programs to develop chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles, and other delivery systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles and dispersal systems designed for use on aircraft, including any holdings and precise locations of such weapons, components, sub-components, stocks of agents, and related material and equipment, the locations and work of its research, development and production facilities, as well as all other chemical, biological, and nuclear programs, including any which it claims are for purposes not related to weapon production or material. 
<br>Decides that false statements or omissions in the declarations submitted by Iraq pursuant to this resolution and failure by Iraq at any time to comply with, and cooperate fully in the implementation of, this resolution shall constitute a further material breach of Iraq's obligations and will be reported to the Council for assessment. 
<br>Decides that Iraq shall provide UNMOVIC and the IAEA immediate, unimpeded, unconditional, and unrestricted access to any and all, including underground, areas, facilities, buildings, equipment, records, and means of transport which they wish to inspect, as well as immediate, unimpeded, unrestricted, and private access to all officials and other persons whom UNMOVIC and the IAEA wish to interview in the mode or location of UNMOVIC's or the IAEA's choice pursuant to any aspect of their mandates; further decides that UNMOVIC and IAEA may at their discretion conduct interviews inside or outside of Iraq, may facilitate the travel of those interviewed and family members outside of Iraq, and that, at the sole discretion of UNMOVIC and the IAEA, such interviews may occur without the presence of observers from the Iraqi Government; and instructs UNMOVIC and requests the IAEA to resume inspections no later than 45 days following adoption of this resolution and to update the Council 60 days thereafter. 
<br>Endorses the 8 October 2002 letter from the Executive Chairman of UNMOVIC and the Director-General of IAEA to General Al-Saadi of the Government of Iraq, which is annexed hereto, and decides that the contents of the letter shall be binding upon Iraq. 
<br>Decides further that, in view of the prolonged interruption by Iraq of the presence UNMOVIC and the IAEA and in order for them to accomplish the tasks set forth in this resolution and all previous relevant resolutions and notwithstanding prior understandings, the Council hereby establishes the following revised or additional authorities, which shall be binding upon Iraq, to facilitate their work in Iraq: 
<br>UNMOVIC and the IAEA shall determine the composition of their inspection teams and ensure that these teams are composed of the most qualified and experienced experts availablel; 
<br>All UNMOVIC and IAEA personnel shall enjoy the privileges and immunities, corresponding to those of experts on mission, provided in the Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations and the Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the IAEA; 
<br>UNMOVIC and the IAEA shall have unrestricted rights of entry into and out of Iraq, the right to free, unrestricted, and immediate movement to and from inspection sites, and the right to inspect any sites and buildings, including immediate, unimpeded, unconditional, and unrestricted access to Presidential Sites equal to that at other sites, notwithstanding the provisions of resolution 1154; 
<br>UNMOVIC and the IAEA shall have the right to be provided by Iraq the names of all personnel currently and formerly associated with Iraq's chemical, biological, nuclear, and ballistic missile programs and the associated research, development, and production facilities; 
<br>Security of UNMOVIC and IAEA facilities shall be ensured by sufficient United Nations security guards; 
<br>The UNMOVIC and the IAEA shall have the right to declare, for the purposes of freezing a site to be inspected, exclusion zones, including surrounding areas and transit corridors, in which Iraq will suspend ground and aerial movement so that nothing is changed in or taken out of a site being inspected; 
<br>The UNMOVIC and the IAEA shall have the free and unrestricted use and landing of fixed- and rotary-winged aircraft including manned and unmanned reconnaissance vehicles; 
<br>The UNMOVIC and the IAEA shall have the right at their sole discretion verifiably to remove, destroy, or render harmless all prohibited weapons, subsystems, components, records, materials, and other related items, and the right to impound or close any facilities or equipment for the production thereof; and 
<br>UNMOVIC and the IAEA shall have the right to free import and use of equipment or materials for inspections and to seize and export any equipment, materials, or documents taken during inspections, without search of UNMOVIC and IAEA personnel or official or personal baggage; 
<br>Decides further that Iraq shall not take or threaten hostile acts directed against any representative or personnel of the United Nations or the IAEA or of any Member State taking action to uphold any Council resolution; 
<br>Requests the Secretary-General immediately to notify Iraq of this resolution, which is binding on Iraq; demands that Iraq confirm within seven days of that notification its intention to comply fully with this resolution; and demands that Iraq cooperate immediately, unconditionally, and actively with UNMOVIC and IAEA. 
<br>Requests all Member States to give full support to UNMOVIC and the IAEAin the discharge of their mandates, including by providing any information related to prohibited programs or other aspects of their mandates, including on Iraqi attempts since 1998 to acquire prohibited items, and by recommending sites to be inspected, persons to be interviewed, conditions of such interviews, and data to be collected, the results of which shall be reported to the Council by UNMOVIC and IAEA; 
<br>Directs the Executive Chairman of UNMOVIC and the Director-General of the IAEA to report immediately to the Council any interference by Iraq with inspection activities, as well as any failure by Iraq to comply with its disarmament obligations, including its obligations regarding inspections under this resolution; 
<br>Decides to convene immediately upon receipt of a report in accordance with paragraphs 4 or 11 above, in order to consider the situation and the need for full compliance with all of the relevant Council resolutions in order to secure international peace and security; 
<br>Recalls, in that context, that the Council has repeatedly warned Iraq that it will face serious consequences as a result of its continued violations of its obligations; 
<br>Decides to remain seized of the matter. 
<br>
<br>In conclusion, dear listeners, every member of the United Nations Security Council voted in favor of United Nations Security Resolution 1441 on November 8th, 2002. The unanimity of the vote is evidence that the United Nations is unwavering in its resolve to see Saddam Hussein's regime disarmed in a peaceful manner. UNSCR 1441 has clearly strengthened the cause of peace throughout the world. We can only hope that Saddam Hussein seizes the opportunity to begin the end of the isolation and suffering that his non-compliance with past UN resolutions has brought on the Iraqi people
