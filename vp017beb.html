NOTES 
<br>
<br>1. Recounted in Thomas J. McNulty, "Television's Impact on Executive Decisionmaking and Diplomacy," The Fletcher
<br>Forum of World Affairs, 17 (Winter 1993), 81-82. 
<br>
<br>2. "CNN pushed the boundaries of world news: no longer did the network merely report events, but through its immediate
<br>reportage, CNN actually shaped the events and became part of them." Lewis Friedland, Covering the World: International
<br>Television News Services (New York: Twentieth Century Fund Press, 1992), p. 2. CNN became the news source of choice
<br>among national elites; Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak told CNN interviewer Bernard Shaw: "I waited all the time,
<br>watching CNN. For five, six hours I didn't move," an apparent case of what doctors came to label "the CNN effect":
<br>interminable watching of the war; Bernard Shaw CNN interview, 10 January 1991, cited in Thomas B. Allen, F. Clifton
<br>Berry, and Norman Polmar, CNN: War in the Gulf (Atlanta: Turner Publishing, 1991). 
<br>
<br>3. McNulty, pp. 78, 82. 
<br>
<br>4. Michael J. Mazarr, Jeffrey Shaffer, and Benjamin Ederington use the term "CNN war" in The Military Technical
<br>Revolution: A Structural Framework (Washington: Center for Strategic and International Studies, March 1993), p. 11, but
<br>the term had popular usage prior to this. 
<br>
<br>5. Marconi patented wireless telegraphy in 1897; voice wireless was available in 1907; commercial radio broadcasting
<br>began in 1920. Melvin L. DeFleur and Sandra J. Ball-Rokeach, Theories of Mass Communication (New York: Longman,
<br>1989), ch. 4. 
<br>
<br>6. Television's role in changing weaponry has unfolded much like radio-based weaponry. The lags in militarization parallel
<br>the lags in commercialization and market saturation of both radio and TV technologies. By 1935 nearly every US household
<br>had a radio; by 1985 nearly every US household had a color TV. See DeFleur and Ball-Rokeach, also Howard A Frederick,
<br>Global Communication & International Relations (Belmont, Calif.: Wadsworth, 1993), ch. 3. Today's military, however,
<br>has nothing to match the technology of CNN, which integrates mobile video, minicams, cellular communications, "fly-away"
<br>satellite datalinks, and network control systems to coordinate live video of events, expert analysis, and access to political
<br>and military leadership, delivered worldwide. 
<br>
<br>7. Bush quote in Friedland, pp. 7-8. Marlin Fitzwater's description of the interplay between Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's
<br>proposals for possible settlement of the Gulf War crisis and US President Bush's swift rejection two hours after Saddam's
<br>broadcast is from McNulty, p. 71. Similar dynamics have been reported during the Clinton presidency. See Eleanor Clift and
<br>Bob Cohn, "Seven Days," Newsweek, 12 July 1993, p. 18. "Particularly during crises," McNulty wrote (pp. 67, 71),
<br>"television images are deeply imprinted on White House decision-making; they permeate discussions from the earliest senior
<br>staff meeting and the president's intelligence briefing an hour later to those meetings conducted at the end of the day in the
<br>Oval Office or over drinks upstairs in the official residence. . . . The normal information flow into the Oval Office was
<br>vastly altered by live video images." 
<br>
<br>8. Theodore Postol, "Lessons of the Gulf War: Experience with Patriot," International Security, 16 (Winter 1991-92), 119. 
<br>
<br>9. Quoted in David S. Broder, "Looking Ahead in '92," Boston Globe (6 April 1994), p. 15. 
<br>
<br>10. Carnes Lord, security advisor of former Vice President Dan Quayle, went on: "The more widespread information is
<br>about things like this, the more congressmen you have becoming secretaries of state." Quoted in McNulty, pp. 72, 81. 
<br>
<br>11. Quoted in Friedland, p. 7. Throughout the buildup to the Gulf War President Bush, Saddam Hussein, UN leaders, Soviet
<br>intermediaries, and other world leaders used CNN as what Friedland called a "diplomatic seismograph and party line," to
<br>signal intent and address messages to one another, bypassing formal diplomatic channels. 
<br>
<br>12. Quoted in Dallas Morning News, 18 July 1993, p. 1j. Shanto Iyengar and Donald R. Kinder, in News That Matters,
<br>wrote that TV news offers simplified visions of events "priming certain aspects of national life while ignoring others," and
<br>thereby setting "the terms by which political judgments are rendered and political choices made" (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago
<br>Press, 1987), p. 4. 
<br>
<br>13. Former Secretary of State George Shultz observed that satellite TV news "puts everybody on real time, because
<br>everyone is seeing the same thing." Quoted in McNulty, p. 74. 
<br>
<br>14. Former FCC Chairman Newton Minnow, quoted in McNulty, p. 82. Walter B. Wriston, in The Twilight of Sovereignty
<br>(New York: Scribner's Sons, 1992), argues that modern communications greatly reduce the traditional control and
<br>sovereignty of nation-states. 
<br>
<br>15. The news media, Michael Crichton wrote, "have treated information the way John D. Rockefeller treated oil--as a
<br>commodity, in which the distribution network, rather than product quality, is of primary importance." Michael Crichton, "The
<br>Mediasaurus," Wired (September-October 1993). 
<br>
<br>16. See, for example, Richard M. Perloff, The Dynamics of Persuasion (Hillsdale, N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates,
<br>1993); or Anthony R. Pratkanis and Eliot Aronson, Age of Propaganda: The Everyday Use and Abuse of Persuasion (New
<br>York: W. H. Freeman, 1992). 
<br>
<br>17. See, for example, Robert B. Cialdini, Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion (New York: Quill William Morrow,
<br>1993). 
<br>
<br>18. In experiments during World War II a two-sided message (to continue the war against Japan) produced greater attitude
<br>change than a one-sided message, especially among those who originally opposed continuing the war. The one-sided
<br>message (to continue the war) brought about greater attitude change among those who initially supported that view. Better
<br>educated soldiers were more favorably affected by two-sided arguments, while poorly educated soldiers were more
<br>responsive to one-sided appeals. See Carl I. Hovland, A. A. Lumsdaine, and F. D. Sheffield, Experiments on Mass
<br>Communication (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton Univ. Press, 1949), p. 105; Pratkanis and Aronson, p. 165; Shelley E. Taylor
<br>and Suzanne C. Thompson, "Stalking the Elusive `Vividness' Effect," Psychological Review, 89 (No. 2, 1982), 155-81;
<br>Perloff, pp. 139, 171. 
<br>
<br>19. Imagery and emotion figured prominently in President Clinton's 1992 speech accepting the Democratic nomination.
<br>Presidential candidate Bill Clinton reflected his deepest emotion when he derided his opponent, George Bush, for "the
<br>vision thing." That is, Clinton portrayed his opponent's lack of a vision where the country was going as his greatest flaw.
<br>Clinton told the delegates that the thing about Bush that really made him mad was this lack of a defining and guiding image
<br>for the country's future, a vision Clinton proposed to provide from the White House. 
<br>
<br>20. "From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an iron curtain has descended across the continent," Churchill
<br>penned in the early morning hours as his train approached Westminster College in Missouri. During World War II
<br>Churchill's first speech as Prime Minister in the House of Commons began with emotional imagery: "I have nothing to offer
<br>but blood, toil, tears, and sweat." On the Westminster speech and the rhetoric of Sir Winston Churchill, see James C. Humes,
<br>The Sir Winston Method: The Five Secrets of Speaking the Language of Leadership (New York: William Morrow, 1991),
<br>pp. 61-63. 
<br>
<br>21. Psychologically extemporaneous remarks seem to audiences more sincere and genuine than prepared remarks since they
<br>appear to be more characteristic of the individual's beliefs and emotions than of the social demands of the speech setting.
<br>See Edward E. Jones and Daniel McGillis, "Correspondent Inferences and the Attribution Cube," in New Directions in
<br>Attribution Research, Volume 1, ed. John H. Harvey, William J. Ickes, and Robert F. Kidd (Hillsdale, N.J.: Lawrence
<br>Erlbaum Associates, 1976), pp. 389-420.

<br>
<br>23. "They [moving pictures] come, we imagine, directly to us without human meddling, and they are the most effortless food
<br>for the mind conceivable. . . . On the screen the whole process of observing, describing, reporting, and then imagining, has
<br>been accomplished for you." Walter Lippmann, Public Opinion (New York: Free Press, 1965, originally published 1922),
<br>p. 61. 
<br>
<br>24. Stephen Baker, Visual Persuasion (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1961). 
<br>
<br>25. Quoted in Todd Gitlin, "TV & American Culture: Flat and Happy," The Wilson Quarterly, 17 (Autumn 1993), 55. 
<br>
<br>26. The public's ideal construct of journalism equates news, objectivity, credibility, and reality. Social construction theory
<br>and media dependency theory address the question "Under what circumstances do we believe the political images we see on
<br>TV are real?" Social construction of reality theory is associated with Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann, The Social
<br>Construction of Reality (New York: Doubleday, 1966), and Erving Goffman, Frame Analysis: An Essay on the
<br>Organization of Experience (New York: Harper and Row, 1974). Media dependency theory is associated with Hanna
<br>Adoni and Sherrill Mane, "Media and the Social Construction of Reality: Toward an Integration of Theory and Research,"
<br>Communications Research, 11 (1984), 323-40; and Dan Nimmo and James E. Combs, Mediated Political Realities (New
<br>York: Longman, 1990). 
<br>
<br>27. These subframes for news were defined by Philo C. Wasburn, Broadcasting Propaganda: International Radio
<br>Broadcasting and the Construction of Political Reality (Westport, Conn.: Praeger, 1992). 
<br>
<br>28. Typically the actor frame ignores the more abstract, less telegenic processes, forces, power relations, and economic
<br>factors that underlie events. We tend to attribute motives and causality to whatever actors we focus on. Darren Newtson,
<br>"Foundations of Attribution: The Perception of Ongoing Behavior," in Harvey, Ickes, and Kidd, pp. 242-43. 
<br>
<br>29. Detractors from the dramatic evolution of the image story line are avoided in news production: the technical details;
<br>histories and legacies; interconnections with other events and stories; and any truly unknown factor, uncertainties, or
<br>complexities are eliminated to maintain a "clean story line." 
<br>
<br>30. Soldiers' war has been described as interminable periods of "sheer boredom punctuated by moments of stark terror." The
<br>soldier frame, however, creates too much media "dead air time;" so media images of war cut to the chase and highlight the
<br>action. Media war is motion- and action-filled; things must be happening to be seen. "Soldiers' war" quote attributed to
<br>Harry G. Summers, Jr., On Strategy, in Jay M. Shafritz, Words on War: Military Quotations from Ancient Times to the
<br>Present (New York: Prentice Hall, 1990), p. 458. 
<br>
<br>31. There may be a basic psychological tendency to focus on fewer relevant cues with greater intensity as emotional arousal
<br>increases, rather than looking for finer levels of analysis. Newtson, p. 234. 
<br>
<br>32. Accepting the official sources frame limits alternative perspectives and polarizes viewpoints as either pro or con;
<br>whereas other, different, and distinct viewpoints create distracting and irrelevant images and are excluded from the frame. 
<br>
<br>33. Ted Koppel, ABC Nightline anchorman, quoted in Erika Fitzpatrick, "Media, Policy: Koppel Checks Links," Boston
<br>Globe, 27 April 1994, p. 8. 
<br>
<br>34. Both quotes in Michael Kramer, "The Political Interest: It's All Foreign to Clinton," Time, 18 October 1993, p. 75. 
<br>
<br>35. Chuck de Caro, "Sats, Lies, and Video-Rape: The Soft War Handbook" (Washington: Aerobureau Corporation, 1993), p.
<br>24. 
<br>
<br>36. See Ambassador Robert B. Oakley's account, "What We Learned in Somalia," The Washington Post, 20 March 1994, p.
<br>C7, and Rick Atkinson's series on the Ranger and Delta Force operations published in The Washington Post in February
<br>1994. 
<br>
<br>37. Months after the events in October the print media rediscovered the Mogadishu story and recast it. The revisionist
<br>versions became a tale of "amazing valor" by the American Rangers. See, for example, Kevin Fedarko, "Amid Disaster,
<br>Amazing Valor," Time, 28 February 1994, p. 46. 
<br>
<br>38. "The consensus that drove Congress and the administration to support the deployment of American forces into [Somalia]
<br>. . . evaporated when the body of a single American soldier was dragged through the streets of Mogadishu. That image,
<br>broadcast and rebroadcast by all the media, produced a wave of revulsion across America." James Adams, "The Role of the
<br>Media," Conference on Ethnic Conflict and Regional Instability (Cambridge, Mass.: Fletcher School of Law and
<br>Diplomacy, Tufts University, 17-18 November 1993), p. 4. 
<br>
<br>39. Commentators have suggested that "image wars" have become commonplace in politics. For example, besides de Caro
<br>and McNulty, see Bernard Cohen, The Press and Foreign Policy (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton Univ. Press, 1963); William
<br>Hachten, "The Triumph of Western News Communication," The Fletcher Forum of World Affairs, 17 (Winter 1993);
<br>Patrick O'Heffernan, Mass Media and American Foreign Policy: Insider Perspectives on Global Journalism and the
<br>Foreign Policy Process (Norwood, N.J.: Ablex, 1991); and Michael J. O'Neill, The Roar of the Crowd: How Television
<br>and People Power are Changing the World (New York: Random House, 1994). 
<br>
<br>40. "The key to finding meaning in things," Arthur Asa Berger's introduction to semiotics suggests, "is to realize that we live
<br>in a world that is full of signs--a sign being something that stands for or represents something else." Arthur Asa Berger,
<br>Signs in Contemporary Culture (Salem, Wisc.: Sheffield, 1989), p. viii. 
<br>
<br>41. Related to the author by Professor Charles McClintock, at the time a teen-aged participant-observer of World War II
<br>map-tracking and fireside chats. 
<br>
<br>42. See James H. Doolittle, I Could Never Be So Lucky Again (New York: Bantam Books, 1991). The psychological utility
<br>of dramatic special operations in capturing public attention and support, above and beyond any military significance, was
<br>fully appreciated and exploited by both Roosevelt and Churchill. The principle they followed was defined by de
<br>Tocqueville: "No kind of greatness is more pleasing to the imagination of a democratic people than military greatness which
<br>is brilliant and sudden, won without hard work, by risking nothing but one's life." Democracy in America (New York:
<br>Anchor Books, 1969), p. 657, quoted in Eliot A. Cohen, Commandos and Politicians: Elite Military Units in Modern
<br>Democracies (Cambridge, Mass.: Center for International Affairs, Harvard Univ., 1978), p. 50. 
<br>
<br>43. Roosevelt frequently conversed with his friend Jack Warner of Warner Brothers about Hollywood's treatment of war
<br>themes. Casablanca opened in Hollywood on Thanksgiving Day, only 18 days after the Allied landings in Casablanca.
<br>President Roosevelt saw the film on New Year's Eve, 31 December 1942. Soon after, Roosevelt severed relations with
<br>Vichy France. In January 1943, when the film was generally released, Roosevelt, linking fantasy to reality, traveled secretly
<br>to Casablanca to confer with Churchill and the new leader of the Free French, De Gaulle. The political fantasy of
<br>Casablanca," write Nimmo and Combs, "is one of individual commitments that add up to a national commitment against
<br>fascism. America must fight, however reluctantly. . . . Casablanca permitted wartime audiences to solidify their own
<br>commitment by identification with the character of Rick." See the analysis of the interaction of the film Casablanca and
<br>wartime public opinion in Nimmo and Combs, pp. 116-18. On the social context of Casablanca, see Clifford McCarty,
<br>Bogey: The Films of Humphrey Bogart (New York: Bonanza Books, 1965), and Aljean Harmetz, Round Up the Usual
<br>Suspects: The Making of Casablanca--Bogart, Bergman, and World War II (New York: Hyperion, 1992). 
<br>
<br>44. CNN and the networks went live to their reporters in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, depicting a bedlam of news persons,
<br>thinking they were being gassed, trying to don gas masks, insert ear pieces, and speak into their microphones at the same
<br>time, while images gyrated wildly as camera persons attempted the same juggling feats. 
<br>
<br>45. On the night of the first Scud attacks on Israel, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleberger "had just returned from a
<br>weekend mission to Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, where the Israelis--reluctant to abandon their military self-sufficiency--had
<br>rejected an American offer of Patriot missiles. `If they've been hit with chemicals, Katie bar the door because they're going
<br>to do something,' Eagleberger predicted. `I know these people. They're going to retaliate. If it's nerve gas, we'll never stop
<br>them.'" Related in Rick Atkinson, Crusade: The Untold Story of the Persian Gulf War (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1993), p.
<br>82. 
<br>
<br>46. Allen, Berry, and Polmar, p. 158. 
<br>
<br>47. NBC correspondent Arthur Kent (soon to become celebrated as "the Scud Stud") broadcasting from Dhahran rooftops,
<br>gas mask in hand, shouted his description of the mid-air engagement over the air raid sirens. There were striking parallels
<br>between the broadcasts of NBC's Kent and CNN's Charles Jaco in the coverage of the Scud-Patriot duels and Edward R.
<br>Morrow's graphic rooftop radio reporting of the fires and bombings during Hitler's Blitz of London. Both episodes set new
<br>standards for heroic war broadcasting, both used the advantages of the media to the fullest, both mobilized deeply emotional
<br>worldwide sympathy and support for stout-hearted and brave civilian defenders, facing up to a tyrant's terror attacks, and
<br>both provided extraordinarily captivating drama. 
<br>
<br>48. Rather than destroying the coalition against him by his attacks on Israel, Saddam consolidated the coalition by his
<br>ineffectual but no less insulting attacks on Saudi Arabia. Allen, Berry, and Polmar, p. 158. 
<br>
<br>49. When MIT Professor Theodore Postol, a critic of the Patriot's technical performance, assessed the Patriot's performance
<br>in the Persian Gulf conflict, he overlooked the missile's role in CNN war. "Most importantly, the serendipitous political and
<br>psychological contributions of Patriot in the specific circumstances of the Gulf War do not appear to offer a basis for further
<br>national security planning," Postol wrote in "Lessons of the Gulf War: Experience with Patriot," p. 119. The dominating
<br>strategic perception was of Patriots defeating Scuds, vividly and dramatically. This perception shaped and determined the
<br>strategic reality of Saddam's Scud offensive, regardless of the technical realities in the skies. The debate literature includes
<br>Richard Perle, "Savior from the Saddams," Jerusalem Post, 31 January 1994; Stephen Budiansky, "Playing Patriot Games,"
<br>U.S. News & World Report, 22 November 1993; Tim Weiner, "Patriot Missile's Success a Myth, Israeli Aides Say," The
<br>New York Times, 21 November 1993; and Reuven Pedatzur and Theodore Postol, "The Patriot is No Success Story,"
<br>Defense News, 2 December 1993. Three articles: Theodore Postol, "Lessons of the Gulf War: Experience with Patriot;"
<br>Robert M. Stein, "Response to Postol: Patriot Experience in the Gulf War," and "Postol Replies," International Security, 17
<br>(Summer 1992) carry the technical debates. 
<br>
<br>50. See Ernest G. Bormann, The Force of Fantasy: Restoring the American Dream (Carbondale: Southern Illinois Univ.
<br>Press, 1985). World culture symbols are often easily leveraged for political effect. See also Frank J. Stech, "Upheaval in
<br>Europe: PSYOP Communications Lessons Learned," Special Warfare, 5 (October 1992), for an assessment of the role of
<br>symbolic communications in the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. 
<br>
<br>51. Alfred Mahan considered communications as dominating war, "the most important single element in strategy, political or
<br>military." For Mahan, the ability to insure one's own communications and to interrupt an adversary's is the root of national
<br>power. Mahan was thinking primarily about sea lines of communications, but he meant not just trade but communication of
<br>information and knowledge as well. Trevor Royle, A Dictionary of Quotations (New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1989),

<br>
<br>56. The military's view of the press as either enemy or public relations organ was recently expressed by Judson J. Conner:
<br>"The media represent a frustrating mixed bag of opportunity and grief. Ever ready to criticize, condemn, abuse, and send
<br>careers spiraling downward, these same organs of information can applaud, congratulate, sing praises, and carry careers
<br>onward and upward." Meeting the Press: A Media Survival Guide for Defense Managers (Washington: National Defense
<br>Univ. Press, 1993). 
<br>
<br>57. The Air Command and Staff College Air Campaign Course Research Project has produced several recent studies on
<br>"information dominance" (other slogans include "soft war," "soft kill," and "information warfare"). None of these studies
<br>mentions CNN war, reflects an appreciation of the role of real-time media coverage of military events, or assesses the
<br>effects of televised news images on military and political decisionmaking. They do, however, reflect an appreciation of the
<br>central role of information flows among military and policy users on the planning and conduct of military operations and the
<br>need to influence the flow of information in peacetime and to dominate it in war. See Gregory A. Biscone, James R.
<br>Hawkins, and Anthony M. Mauer, "Campaigning for Information Dominance;" Paul DiJulio, Bernie Kring, K. C. Schow, and
<br>Mark Williams, "Communications-Computer Systems: Critical Centers of Gravity;" and Alan L. Smith, "Infopower:

<br>reports, briefings, and other miscellany. The disk is "bundled" in many personal computer CD-ROM add-on kits. 
<br>
<br>60. Thrall. Scott Simon of National Public Radio reported (in an interview on NPR's Talk of the Nation, October 1993) that
<br>several members of the press were fully briefed before the ground offensive that the Marine amphibious landing was an
<br>allied deception. The Marines briefed the press to prevent them from inadvertently blowing the story by naively covering it.
<br>The witting members of the press, sworn to secrecy, maintained the security of the deception, and supported it with
<br>continued press coverage of the practice Marine landings.

<br>63. Judson J. Connor rightly observes that manipulating the press, is "a crime which ranks, in the eyes of the media, right up
<br>there with murder and mayhem." Meeting the Press: A Media Survival Guide for the Defense Manager, p. xii. Politicians
<br>and military leaders have long understood that public support is essential for successful military operations, certainly since
<br>the rise of mass armies in Napoleon's day and the beginning of industrial warfare in the time of Lincoln and Grant. Public
<br>support is largely a strategic, not a tactical or operational responsibility. Commanders must conduct tactics and operations
<br>consistent with strategy. Considering the evening news "media spin" in campaign planning does not offer the most
<br>constructive basis for planning operations in the next CNN war, and puts strategic goals in the place of tactical and
<br>operational objectives. 
<br>
<br>64. See Colonel John Mountcastle, Director, Strategic Studies Institute, foreword to Charles W. Ricks, The Military-News
<br>Media Relationship: Thinking Forward (Carlisle Barracks, Pa.: Strategic Studies Institute, US Army War College, 1

<br>
<br>65. Ricks, p. vi. One hopes that this proposed military infrastructure will be well-schooled in the guidelines for creating
<br>compelling and persuasive visual images, in the requirements for framing credible news stories, and in the semiotic uses of
<br>signs and symbols--i.e., that they practice tactics and operational arts developed explicitly for CNN war-fighting needs.

<br>also Lance Morrow, "In Feeding Somalia and Backing Yeltsin, America Discovers the Limits of Idealism," Time, 18
<br>October 1993, pp. 37ff. James Adams of The Sunday Times (London) lamented "with [a public] attention span so short and a
<br>world view so limited, it is difficult to conceive how consistent policy for crisis management can be developed by the
<br>world's leading democracies." Adams, p. 9. 
<br>
<br>69. Morrow, pp. 37ff. 
<br>
<br>70. Krauthammer's assessment of the origins of Persian Gulf War totally discounts the role of such images as the smuggled
<br>home videos of Iraqi tanks rolling through the streets of Kuwait City, Iraqi firing squads executing "looters" in the streets, a
<br>sanctimonious Saddam Hussein asking a terrified five-year old British hostage, Stuart Lockwood, "Are you getting your
<br>milk, Stuart, and corn flakes, too?" and related incidents. With all that has been written of the role of CNN before, during,
<br>and after the Persian Gulf War, one would think anyone who watched CNN might perceive the importance of pictures in
<br>leading the United States to that conflict.

<br>75. Czech President Vaclav Havel's address to the US Congress in 1990 opened with this observation: "The human face of
<br>the world is changing so rapidly that none of the familiar political speedometers are adequate. We playwrights, who have to
<br>cram a whole human life or an entire historical era into a two-hour play, can scarcely understand this rapidity ourselves.
<br>And if it gives us trouble, think of the trouble it must give to political scientists who spend their whole life studying the
<br>realm of the probable and have even less experience with the realm of the improbable than the playwrights." 
<br>
<br>76. The late Joseph Campbell, professor of mythology at Sarah Lawrence, discussed the idea of "human face" and the
<br>compelling images in the Star Wars films of the "light side" and the "dark side" as symbols for good and evil. Joseph
<br>Campbell with Bill Moyers, The Power of Myth (New York: Doubleday, 1988), p. 144.

<br>Lieutenant Colonel Frank J. Stech, USAR, was a 1994 US Army War College Research Fellow at the Fletcher School of
<br>Law and Diplomacy. His most recent military assignments have been in Psychological Operations: as Commander 305th
<br>PSYOP Company, Executive Officer 7th PSYOP Battalion, and as Intelligence Officer and Operations Officer 5th PSYOP
<br>Group. In his civilian career, Dr. Stech is a Lead Scientist with the MITRE Corporation in Washington, D.C. The original
