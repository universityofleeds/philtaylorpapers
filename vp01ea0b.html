Enter Percy wearing a matching red outfit and hat -<br> with antlers. The outfit is covered in bells which ring as he walks.<br> Sounds of a celebration are heard outside]<br><br>Percy:		Coming?<br><br>Blackadder:	Nope [offhandedly closing door on Percy]<br><br>Percy:		[re-entering] It will be a once in a lifetime experience.<br><br>Blackadder:	No it won't [closing the door with his foot. Percy<br>		makes a "wauh" noise as he is shoved out]<br><br>Percy:		[entering again, holding his nose] Everybody's going.<br><br>Blackadder:	Don't exaggerate, Percy. I'm not going, Mrs. Miggins<br>		from the pie shop isn't going...<br><br>Percy:		Oh, my lord, you are cruel; you know perfectly well that Mrs.<br>		Miggins is bedridden from the nose down [postures, with his<br>		hand on his hip] And besides, she is honoring the occasion<br>		in her own special way by baking a great commemorative pie,<br>		in the shape of an enormous pie! <br><br>Blackadder:	What an imagination that woman has. [The crowd's<br>		cheering swells outside]<br><br>Percy:		Oh, come on Edmund! The greatest explorer of our age is<br>		coming home. The streets have never been so gay! Women<br>		are laughing, children are singing... Oh look! [pointing out<br>		the window] there's a man being indecently assaulted by<br>		nine foreign sailors, and he's still got a smile on his face!<br><br>Blackadder:	Look, Percy, the return of Sir Walter "Ooh what a big<br>		ship I've got" Raleigh is a matter of supreme indifference<br>		to me.<br><br>Percy:		[leaning in towards him] Look, if you're not careful, all the<br>		children will dance about outside your window, singing<br>		"sourpuss" and "grumpy face", and you wouldn't want that,<br>		now would you?<br><br>Blackadder:	I believe I could survive it. Now, Percy, will you <br>		get out before I cut off your head, scoop out the insides,<br>		and give it to your mother as a vase?! [goes over to Percy,<br>		and, dragging him by his antlers, throws him out again. Slams<br>		door] What a clot. The most absurdly dressed creature<br>		in Christendom [enter Baldrick, wearing a "dung-gatherer's"<br>		version of same. The hat is brown with branches sticking<br>		off the top] (Pauses) With one exception.<br><br>Baldrick:	[looking up at him] My lord?<br><br>Blackadder:	Baldrick, you look like a deer.<br><br>Baldrick:	Thank you my lord. You look a bit of a ducky yourself.<br><br>Blackadder:	Oh God. [in disgust] What do you want?<br><br>Baldrick:	Well, I was wondering if I might have the afternoon off?<br><br>Blackadder:	Of course not; who do you think you are, Watt Tyler?<br>		You can have the afternoon off when you DIE, not before.<br><br>Baldrick:	But I want to cheer brave Sir Walter home. Oh, dear sir, <br>		on a day like today I feel proud to be a member of the<br>		greatest kingdom in the world.<br><br>Blackadder:	And doubtless many other members of the animal kingdom<br>		feel the same way but - [crowd cheering rises again.<br>		Blackadder gestures threateningly at the window]<br>		Look, will you shut up?! Bloody explorers, ponce off<br>		to mumbo-jumbo-land, come home with a tropical disease,<br>		a suntan and a bag of brown lumpy things, and, Bob's your uncle,<br>		everyone's got a picture of them in the lavatory. I mean,<br>		what about the people that do all the work?<br><br>Baldrick:	The servants.<br><br>Blackadder:	No, me; *I'm* the people who do all the work. I mean *look*<br>		at this! [goes to a table at the side of the room and<br>		picks up a small brown thing and holds it up] *What* is it?<br><br>Baldrick:	Oh, I'm surprised you've forgotten, my lord.<br><br>Blackadder:	I haven't forgotten; it's a rhetorical question.<br><br>Baldrick:	[looking at him] No, it's a potato.<br><br>Blackadder:	To you it's a potato, to me it's a potato. But to<br>		Sir Walter Bloody Raleigh it's country estates, fine carriages,<br>		and as many girls as his tongue can cope with. He's making<br>		a fortune out of the things; people are smoking them,<br>		building houses out of them... They'll be eating them next.<br>		[shoves it into Baldrick's chest; Baldrick takes it and looks<br>		at it]<br><br>Baldrick:	Stranger things have happened.<br><br>Blackadder:	Oh, exactly.<br><br>Baldrick:	[continues] That horse becoming Pope.<br><br>Blackadder:	The what? [Someone knocks on the door and Baldrick goes to<br>		answer it] Oh God. Probably some birk with a parrot on his<br>		shoulder selling plaster gnomes of Sir Francis Drake and his<br>		Golden beHind [A child is heard outside singing "sourpuss,<br>		grumpy face, sourpuss, grumpy face..."[Miranda Richardson,<br>		actually]. Edmund pulls out a bow, nocks an arrow and shoots.<br>		The singing stops with an abrupt "aah! Mummy..."]<br>		[Edmund shouts out the window] And another thing: why<br>		aren't you at school?<br><br>		[Melchett, followed by Baldrick comes in the room]<br><br>Melchett:	Blackadder, started talking to yourself I see.<br><br>Blackadder:	[Turning away from the window] Yes, it's the only way I can<br>		be sure of intelligent conversation. What do you want?<br><br>Melchett:	Well I just looked in on my way to the palace to welcome<br>		Sir Walter home; I wondered if you cared to accompany me.<br><br>Blackadder:	I don't think I'll bother, actually; three hours of<br>		bluff seaman's talk about picking the weevils out of<br>		biscuits and drinking urine is not my idea of a good time.<br><br>Melchett:	As you wish. [To Baldrick] Servant, my hat. [Baldrick leaves.<br>		Melchett holds out a box toward Blackadder] Potato?<br><br>Blackadder:	Thanks, I don't. [Melchett takes a bite of one]. I <br>		see you haven't succumbed to this fad of dressing up<br>		like half an allotment in Nottingham Forest. [Baldrick<br>		enters carrying Melchett's hat]<br><br>Baldrick:	There you go, my lord [hands Melchett his hat. It is<br>		decorated with not only antlers but feathers as well]<br><br>Blackadder:	-You have.<br><br>Melchett:	It's probably just as well you're not coming, Blackadder,<br>		you're not very popular at court at the moment, and the<br>		Queen and I have- [Blackadder interrupts him]<br><br>Blackadder:	-Yes, well I can probably leave this 'til tomorrow in fact.<br>		[over Melchett's protests "you needn't bother"]. No, no, I'll<br>		come with you; obviously the Queen and I will be the<br>		only ones even *vaguely* sensibly dressed. [follows<br>		Melchett out and slams the door behind him]<br><br>		--------------------<br><br>		[cut to the Queen, who is wearing an eyepatch and a <br>		 special matching crown(?). A knock is heard at the door]<br><br>Queen:		Who is it?<br><br>Melchett:	Melchy, Lady. [He tries to open the door]<br><br>Queen:		[keeping door closed with her hand] -But soft! Close your<br>		eyes! [She runs back to throne next to Nursie] Now enter!<br>		[He enters, hand draped melodramatically over eyes. Queen<br>		says:] Ahoy there, me shivering matey, heave-ho! [Seats<br>		herself]. Right, open your eyes.<br><br>Melchett:	Thank you, Majesty. And- [bows slightly, pretends to <br>		look around in puzzlement]<br><br>Queen:		[smiling widely but playing the innocent] Why, what's the<br>		matter, Melchy?<br><br>Melchett:	Well, I beg your pardon, my Lady. I was wanting to greet<br>		the gallant sailor who hallooed me as I came in [Queen<br>		squeals with delight] Perchance he has hauled anchor and<br>		sailed away. [Edmund is looking disgusted in the background]<br><br>Queen:		[slyly] No- it was me!<br><br>Melchett:	Majesty! Surely not! <br><br>Blackadder:	You utter creep. [Melchett gives him a condescending<br>		look and moves out of his way so the Queen can greet <br>		Edmund]  So. Where's this barnacle-bottomed, haddock-flavored, <br>		bilge-rat Sir rather-a-wally Raleigh then? I hear he's<br>		about as exciting as one of his potatoes.<br><br>Queen:		Blackadder's a frightful old lubber, eh Melchy?<br><br>Melchett:	Well indubitably no sea-dog, Ma'am. With a Yo-ho-ho<br>		and perhaps, I might venture, a bottle of rum into the<br>		bargain?<br><br>		[A high whistle sounds, like the now-hear-this in ST:TOS]<br><br>Queen:		It's him! Oh God, [picks up a hand mirror] do I look<br>		absolutely divine and regal and yet at the same time<br>		very pretty and rather accessible?<br><br>Melchett:	[bowing] You are every jolly jacktar's dream, Majesty.<br><br>Queen:		I thought as much. If he's really gorgeous, I'm thinking<br>		of marrying him.<br><br>Blackadder:	Ma'am, is that not a little rash?<br><br>Queen:		I don't think so.<br><br>Nursie:		It wouldn't be your first little rash if it was.<br><br>		[The whistle sounds again and Sir Walter enters <br>		 with a flourish and bows deeply and elaborately.<br>		 They all applaud him for his feats. Sir Walter<br>		 is played by Simon Jones, of "Arthur Dent" fame.<br>		 As if I have to tell you]<br><br>Sir Walter:	Majesty! [he sings out] <br><br>Queen:		Splice me timbers, Sir Walter, it's bucko to see you,<br>		old matey!<br><br>Sir Walter:	I'm sorry?<br><br>Blackadder:	[caustically] She says hello.<br><br>Sir Walter:	And well she might, for I have bought her gifts and<br>		dominions beyond her wildest dreams [taking off his<br>		hat and bowing with a flourish again]<br><br>Queen:		Are you sure? I have some pretty wild dreams, you know...<br>		I'm not sure what they mean, but the other day there was<br>		this enormous tree, and I was sitting right on top of it-<br><br>Melchett:	[warningly] Ma'am<br><br>Queen:		And then I dreamt once that I was a sausage roll-<br><br>Melchett:	Majesty-<br><br>Queen:		Sorry! So excited! Don't know what I'm saying. Oh- come on,<br>		Sir Walter, I want to hear about absolutely everything!<br><br>Sir Walter:	[launches into storytelling mode] Then, prepare to hear<br>		tales of terrible hardship, endurance and woe. [All settle]<br>		We set sail from Plymouth in the spring of 1552 [Edmund<br>		yawns quite audibly]<br><br>Queen:		[disparagingly] You remember Lord Blackadder...<br><br>Sir Walter:	[Nods] No. But I can see he is the sort of pasty<br>		landlubber I have always despised [All laugh except<br>		Edmund].<br><br>Queen:		Well, quite. [Angrily] Don't crowd Sir Walter, Edmund.<br><br>Sir Walter:	[continues] Twice, last week, I fought in hand to<br>		hand combat with a man with two heads and no body hair.<br>		I'll warrant, the most exciting thing that has happened<br>		to that limpid prawn in a whole year, was the day his<br>		servant forgot to put sugar in his porridge [Edmund<br>		smiles tensely as they all laugh at him]<br><br>Queen:		[to Sir Walter] Gosh, you've got nice legs.<br><br>Sir Walter:	[continuing on as if he hasn't heard] While I hold<br>		the six seas of the world in my hand, he couldn't<br>		even put six gob-stoppers in his mouth! [all laugh]<br><br>Queen:		He's a complete no-hoper, isn't he, Walt?<br><br>Sir Walter:	He certainly is. [more laughing. Queen stops and says:]<br><br>Queen:		My bedroom's just upstairs, you know.<br><br>Melchett:	I had heard, Sir Walter, that there were only[sic] seven seas.<br><br>Sir Walter:	Ah, only numerically speaking. We sailors do not count<br>		the sea around the Cape of Good Hope. It is called the<br>		Sea of Certain Death, and no sailor has crossed it alive.<br><br>Edmund:		[butts in] Well, well, well, what an extraordinary<br>		coincidence.<br><br>Queen:		What's an extraordinary coincidence? [not caring]<br><br>Edmund:		Oh, it's just I was planning a jaunt around the Cape of Good<br>		Hope, myself. I'm leaving a week on Thursday, I think.<br>		[Queen: "Really?"] Yes, and now that, erm - Sorry, I've<br>		forgotten your name- has returned and the whole court smells<br>		of fish, I've half a mind to set off this afternoon.<br><br>Sir Walter:	If you attempt that journey, you've no mind at all.<br><br>Edmund:		Or perhaps a mind that knows no fear.<br><br>Queen:		Is that true, Edmund? Do you know no fear?<br><br>Edmund:		Well, yes, I do rather laugh in the face of fear,<br>		tweak the nose of terror.<br><br>Queen:		Gosh, Edmund, I'd forgotten how dishy you are.<br><br>Sir Walter:	You'd never dare. Why, 'round the Cape, the rain<br>		beats down so hard it makes your head bleed!<br><br>Edmund:		So, some sort of hat is probably in order.<br><br>Sir Walter:	And great dragons leap from the water and swallow<br>		ships whole!<br><br>Edmund:		-I must remember to pack the larger of my two<br>		shrimping nets.<br><br>Queen:		Edmund, you are completely wonderful. If you do this,<br>		I'll probably marry you [All leave Sir Walter's side<br>		and go flank Blackadder]<br><br>Sir Walter:	Oh yes? And who will be your captain? Hmph! To my mind,<br>		there is only one seafarer with few enough marbles<br>		to attempt that journey.<br><br>Edmund:		Ah yes, and who is that?<br><br>Sir Walter:	Why, Rum, of course. Captain Redbeard Rum.<br><br>Edmund:		Well done. Just testing. And where would I find him on a<br>		Tuesday?<br><br>Sir Walter:	Well, if I remember his habits, he's usually up the Old<br>		Sea Dog.<br><br>Edmund:		Ah yes, and where is the Old Sea Dog?<br><br>Sir Walter:	Well, on Tuesdays he's normally in bed with the Captain.<br><br>		--------------------<br><br>		[cut to a table in a dark room. Rum [Tom Baker, but I<br>		 needn't tell you that] is sitting with his back against<br>		 a wall]<br>		 <br>Rum:		Aaaaaaahrrrrr Aaaaaaahrrrrr Aaaaaaaaaaahrrrrr. Me laddy.<br><br>Blackadder:	Ah-haah-ah, indeed. So, Rum, I wish to hire you and<br>		your ship. Can we shake on it? [holds out hand]<br><br>Rum:		aah-ahhh! [strokes his hand] You have a woman's hand, milord!<br>		I'll wager these dainty pinkies never weighed anchor<br>		in a storm.<br><br>Blackadder:	Well, you're right there.<br><br>Rum:		Ha ha ha. -Aah! Your skin milord. I'll wager it ne'er<br>		felt the lash of a cat ['o' nine tails], been rubbed<br>		with salt, and then flayed off by a pirate chief to make<br>		fine stockings for his best cabin boy.<br><br>Blackadder:	How canny, I don't know how you do it, but you're right<br>		again.<br><br>Rum:		Why should I let a stupid cockerel like you aboard me boat?<br><br>Blackadder:	Perhaps for the money in my purse [holding it up]<br><br>Rum:		Ha. -Aah! You have a woman's purse! [takes it from him and<br>		examines it daintily] I'll wager that purse has never been<br>		used as a rowing-boat. I'll wager it's never had sixteen<br>		shipwrecked mariners tossing in it.<br><br>Blackadder:	Yes, right again, Rum. I must say when it comes to tales of<br>		courage I'm going to have to keep my mouth shut.<br><br>Rum:		Oh! You have a woman's mouth, milord! I'll wager that<br>		mouth never had to chew through the side of a ship<br>		to escape the dreadful spindly killer fish.<br><br>Blackadder:	I must say, when I came to see you, I had no idea I was going<br>		to have to eat your ship as well as hire it. And since you're<br>		clearly as mad as a mongoose I'll bid you farewell [gets up]<br><br>Rum:		Aaah, courtiers to the Queen, you're nothing but lapdogs to a<br>		slip of a girl.<br><br>Blackadder:	Better a "lapdog to a slip of a girl", than a... Git.<br><br>Rum:		So you do have some spunk in you! Don't worry, laddie,<br>		I'll come, I'll come [holds out his hand]<br><br>Blackadder:	Well, let us set sail as soon as we can. [they shake]<br>		I will fetch my first mate, and then I'll return<br>		as fast as my legs will carry me.<br><br>Rum:		Ah! [pointing] You have a woman's legs, my lord! I'll<br>		wager those are legs that have never been sliced clean off<br>		by a falling sail, and swept into the sea before your<br>		very eyes.<br><br>Blackadder:	[crossly] Well, neither have yours.<br><br>Rum:		That's where you're wrong [throws aside table showing<br>		his lack of legs]<br><br>Blackadder:	Oh my God!<br><br>Rum:		No point in changing your mind now; no one else will<br>		come. The whole thing's suicide anyway. What's the<br>		first mate's name?<br><br>Blackadder:	Percy.<br><br>Rum:		A nautical cove?<br><br>Blackadder:	Yes! Well... He's a sort of wet fish.<br><br>		--------------------<br><br>		[cut to Percy and Baldrick in a room. Baldrick<br>		 is folding what appear to be sheets. Perhaps they are sails]<br>		 <br>Percy:		[Petulantly]. I'm not coming. I'm just not coming.<br>		I mean, of course I'm very *keen* to go on the trip,<br>		it's just... unfortunately, uh... I've got an<br>		appointment.... to have my nostrils plucked... next year.<br><br>Baldrick:	Oh, I'm sorry, my lord. I thought it was because you<br>		were a complete coward.<br><br>Percy:		[sounding nervous] Don't be ridiculous, Baldrick...<br>		You know me, I mean... I- laugh in the face of fear,<br>		and- tweak the nose- of the- dreadful spindly killer fish.<br>		I'm not one of your milksops who's scared out of his mind<br>		by the mere sight of water. Gah! [backs away in fear as<br>		Baldrick holds out a goblet of water to his face] Yes, all<br>		right, I admit it, I admit it, I'm terrified! You see, Baldrick,<br>		when I was a baby, I was savaged by a turbot [flounder].<br>		Oh, Baldrick, you can't think of a plan to get me out of<br>		this, can you?<br><br>Baldrick:	Uh, you can hide, my lord.<br><br>Percy:		Hide. Brilliant! Where? [They look around the room.<br>		The trunk the sheet came from is standing invitingly<br>		wide open]<br><br>Baldrick:	Um... [After a few minutes, Baldrick finally sees the box]<br>		In the box!<br><br>Percy:		Which one?! [Figures it out]. Ah - perfect! [Gets in the box]<br>		Let's practice. All right, Edmund comes in and says, "Hello,<br>		Baldrick. You haven't seen Percy, have you?" And you say...<br><br>Baldrick:	Uh. [Thinks hard] No, my lord, I haven't seen him all day.<br><br>Percy:		Brilliant! [They hear a door slam] Oh my God, here he comes!<br>		[Baldrick helps close the box lid on top of him]<br><br>		[Enter Blackadder. Baldrick is standing conspicuously in<br>		 the middle of the room next to the box]<br><br>Blackadder:	Oh, hello, Balders. Where the hell's that cretin Percy;<br>		you haven't seen him, have you? [Baldrick can't remember<br>		what he was supposed to say. He thinks about it. Finally,<br>		with an air of blustery triumph, he says]<br><br>Baldrick:	Yes, my lord! He's hiding on the box!<br><br>Blackadder:	[eyeing the box] Come on, jellybrain. Hurry up, otherwise<br>		we'll miss the tide! [kicks the box, in the manner of, "is<br>		there anybody home?!"]<br><br>		--------------------<br><br>		["Oh, Edmund, I'm SO proud," we hear the pleased voice of<br>		 the Queen, "You're just my complete hero! Oh dear! I'm going<br>		 all gooey now." We see that Edmund has come to say goodbye<br>		 and the Queen has greeted him from her throne.]<br><br>Blackadder:	Ma'am, I move that if during my journey I could believe<br>		that occasionally you did spare me a thought and, perhaps,<br>		go gooey again, I would deem my certain death a minor<br>		inconvenience. [Melchett makes a face as if something smells]<br><br>Queen:		[gushy] Oh Ned... [proudly] I've written a poem!<br><br>Blackadder:	Madam, I'm honored!<br><br>Queen:		[Opens a folded piece of paper, clears throat].<br><br>			When the night is dark,<br>			and the dogs go bark;<br>			When the clouds are black,<br>			and the ducks go- quack;<br>			  [Melchy and Raleigh nod appreciatively]<br>			When the sky is blue,<br>			and the cows go- moo;<br>			  ["Oh, yes" Melchett smarms]<br>			Think of lovely Queenie;<br>			She'll be thinking of you.<br><br>		[Melchy and Raleigh mumble appreciations and applaud.<br>		 The Queen continues:]<br><br>		It's called, "Edmund." Shakespeare gave me a hand with<br>		the title, but the rest is all my own work!<br><br>Nursie:		Tush and fie, my tiddly. You didn't always make such<br>		pretty speeches [Queen makes yawning noises]<br>		'Tis but the twinkling of a toe since you could say<br>		nothing but, "Lizzie go plop, plop; Lizzie go plop, plop--"<br><br>Queen:		-[crossly] Oh, put a bung in it, Nursie. Now! I am sure Melchy<br>		and, uh- [pauses] Wally, want to say something as well.<br><br>"Wally":	Oh, yes indeed! [Crosses over gleefully to Edmund, and<br>		says with audible satisfaction] Goodbye, Blackadder.<br>		I'd say "Bon Voyage," but there's no point. You'll be<br>		dead in three months. [Pats him patronizingly on the shoulder]<br><br>Blackadder:	[equally patronizingly] I love you, Walter, I hope you know that<br><br>		[Melchett steps up to Blackadder]<br><br>Melchett:	Farewell, Blackadder [hands him a parchment]. The foremost<br>		cartographers of the land have prepared this for you; it's<br>		a map of the area that you'll be traversing. [Blackadder opens<br>		it up and sees it is blank] -They'll be very grateful if you<br>		could just fill it in as you go along. Bye-bye.<br><br>		[A hearty "arr-arr" is heard in the background]<br><br>Queen:		What's that? [Baldrick wheels Rum in on a wooden cart]<br><br>Rum:		To ?Tilbury? me hearties! The wind is in the sails,<br>		the oars are in the locks! And we must awaaayyy! [Gestures<br>		grandly with his hands]<br><br>Blackadder:	Lady, it is my captain. Long on beard, short on legs.<br><br>Queen:		Oh, Captain. I wish you luck, from the bottom of my heart.<br><br>Rum:		[Booming] You have a woman's bottom, my Lady! [Gets wheeled<br>		over to her]. I'll wager that sweet round pair of peaches<br>		has never been forced 'twixt two splintered planks, to plug<br>		a leak and save a ship!<br><br>Queen:		Certainly hasn't, and I'm quite pleased about it! Anyway,<br>		what's wrong with women's bottoms?<br><br>Rum:		Not big enough, Ma'am.<br><br>Nursie:		[Makes a noise of excitement] *Mine* might be!<br><br>Rum:		In that case, my little puddin' of delight, let's beat about<br>		the bush no longer. I know I'm only a bluff old cove with<br>		no legs and a beard you could lose a badger in, but if you'll<br>		take me, I'm willing to be captain of your ship, forever!<br>		What do you say?<br><br>Nursie:		[so thrilled she doesn't know what to do with herself]<br>		Yes, please!<br><br>Rum:		[As Baldrick wheels him out] I'll be back! We'll all be back!<br><br>Queen:		Edmund, then, this is it. Oh! [air-kisses his cheeks in a<br>		fake show of affection, then gets brisk and "motherly"]<br>		Have you got clean underwear? And don't eat foreign food.<br>		And watch out for strange men, and discover me a country,<br>		and bring me back a vegetable, and -oh- everything!<br><br>Blackadder:	Madam! I shall do all I can. Farewell! [He closes the<br>		doors behind them, then comes back] And- don't wait up.<br>		[Leaves again]<br><br>Queen:		[looking gushy, and probably covering Raleigh's missing<br>		his cue]  Gosh.<br><br>Sir Walter:	Well! That's the last we'll see of him. In three months' time<br>		he'll be dead as a [pauses and thinks] dead dodo.<br><br>Queen:		Oh, Sir Walter, Really! [Melchett thinks the pun was<br>		intentional and brays appreciatively]<br><br>		--------------------<br><br>		[The scene changes and we are on the ship with<br>		 Blackadder and company. Rum, then Blackadder, then<br>		 Baldrick take turns "aaarrr"- and "aaaha"-ing<br>		 like pirates. All look expectantly at Percy<br>		 but he does not follow suit]<br>		 <br>Blackadder:	Not joining us in the "ha-ha"'s, Percy?<br><br>Percy:		[With visible disdain] No! [valiantly] I'm thinking of<br>		England and the girl I left behind me.<br><br>Blackadder:	[annoyed] Oh, God; I didn't know you had a girl.<br><br>Percy:		[getting all dreamy] Oh, yes. Lady Caroline Fairfax.<br><br>Blackadder:	[surprised] Caroline! I didn't know you knew her.<br><br>Percy:		Oh, yes! I even touched her once.<br><br>Blackadder:	[puzzled] Touched her what?<br><br>Percy:		Uh, once. In the corridor.<br><br>Blackadder:	I've never heard it called *that* before [pauses and<br>		reflects]. Here- when you get home in six months, you'll<br>		be a hero. She might even let you get your hands on<br>		her twice.<br><br>Percy:		I fear not.<br><br>Blackadder:	Why not?<br><br>Percy:		Because we'll never get home. We're doomed, doomed!<br>		Condemned to a watery grave with a captain who's legless-<br><br>Rum:		Rubbish! I've hardly touched a drop!<br><br>Percy:		-No, no. I mean you haven't got any legs.<br><br>Rum:		Oh, yes, you're right there. Carry on, sorry.<br><br>Percy:		[Moans wordlessly] We've got no hope. No hope of ever returning.<br><br>Blackadder:	On the contrary, we are certain to return!<br><br>Percy:		What?!<br><br>Blackadder:	Because, me old sods, we are not going to the Cape<br>		of Good Hope at all. <br><br>All:		WHAT?!!<br><br>Blackadder:	We are in fact going - to France!<br><br>All:		FRANCE!!!!  [Percy gets to his feet with the shock of the news]<br><br>Percy:		But, Edmund, surely France has already been discovered.<br>		[points at him] By the French for a start.<br><br>Blackadder:	Well, precisely; it's a trick. We just camp down in the<br>		?Dardonnes? for six months, get a good suntan, come home,<br>		pretend we've been 'round the Cape, and get all the glory.<br><br>Percy and<br>  Baldrick:	Hooray!<br><br>Rum:		A masterly plan, me young master. And one that leads me<br>		to make an announcement meself.<br><br>Blackadder:	What's that, Rum?<br><br>Rum:		Truth is, I don't know the way to the Cape of Good Hope<br>		anyway. <br><br>Blackadder:	Well, what were you going to do?<br><br>Rum:		Oh, what I usually do. Sail 'round and 'round the<br>		Isle of Wight 'til everyone gets dizzy. Then head for home.<br><br>Blackadder:	You old rascal. Still, who cares; the day after tomorrow<br>		we shall be in Calais. Captain, [stands and raises his glass]<br>		set sail for France!<br><br>		[All save Rum raise their glasses and toast, then<br>		 yell, "Hooray!"]	<br><br>		[The screen blanks and two lines appear in a caption:]<br><br>			    The Day After<br>			The Day After Tomorrow<br><br>		[The four are still sitting in the ship's galley, only<br>		 looking dejected instead of spirited]<br><br>Blackadder:	So. You Don't Know The Way To France, Either.<br><br>Rum:		No! I must confess that, too.<br><br>Blackadder:	[turns toward Percy and Baldrick as if he is going to<br>		announce his revised plan, and says:] Bugger!<br><br>		--------------------<br><br>		[Scene changes to Queen entering a room and Melchett<br>		 and Raleigh bowing]<br>		 <br>Queen:		He's only been gone three days and I am missing him already.<br><br>Raleigh:	[smarmily] Well, perhaps Ma'am, I could amuse you still<br>		further with tales of my adventures.<br><br>Queen:		[menacingly] Like what?<br><br>Raleigh:	Perhaps you would like to hear the one about the mad<br>		pirate king, whose crew consisted entirely of men called<br>		Roger.<br><br>Queen:		[bored] Heard it.<br><br>Raleigh:	Oh. Maybe I could distract you with the tale of the time I<br>		fell into the water and was almost eaten by a hammerhead shark.<br><br>Queen:		Yes. All right, try that one.<br><br>Raleigh:	Well, Ma'am. [with a flourish] I fell into the water.<br>		[pauses for suspense] and was almost eaten by a shark...<br>		And the funny thing is, its head was almost exactly the<br>		same shape as a hammer!<br><br>Queen:		[extremely annoyed] Ooh, God! You'd better come up with<br>		some presents, or I'm going to go off explorers completely!<br><br>Raleigh:	Ma'am?<br><br>Queen:		I'll tell you something else. Edmund was right. You do<br>		smell of fish. Pooey! [leaves in a huff]<br><br>		--------------------<br><br>		[change of scene: Rum, Blackadder, Baldrick and Percy<br>		 are sitting around a table in the galley, ostensibly<br>		 arguing about their plight. Tom Baker can be clearly<br>		 distinguished above the rest yelling "Rhubarb rhubarb rhubarb!<br>		 while the rest are actually talking in a way that their<br>		 characters might]<br><br>Edmund:		Look, there's no need to panic. Someone in the crew will<br>		know how to steer this thing.<br><br>Rum:		The crew, milord? <br><br>Edmund:		Yes, the crew.<br><br>Rum:		What crew?<br><br>Edmund:		I was under the impression that it was common maritime practice<br>		for a ship to have a crew.<br><br>Rum:		Opinion is divided on the subject.<br><br>Edmund:		Oh, really? [starting to get the picture]<br><br>Rum:		Yahs. All the other captains say it is; I say it isn't.<br><br>Edmund:		Oh, God; Mad as a brush.<br><br>		--------------------<br><br>		[The scene blanks out and a caption appears:<br><br>			"Six Months Later"<br>			<br>		 Melchett carries a rolled up parchment which he<br>		 presents to the Queen]<br>		 <br>Melchett:	Sir Walter Raleigh's death warrant for your signature,<br>		Majesty.<br><br>Queen:		[with quill pen at the ready] Oh. Good. Any news of Edmund?<br><br>Melchett:	[smugly] Well, Madam, if they're on course, they should be<br>		nearing the urine-drinking stage by now.<br><br>Queen:		Don't be horrid, Melchy. Edmund would rather die!<br><br>Melchett:	I fear that may be wishful thinking, Majesty. [He blows<br>		the ink dry on Raleigh's death warrant]<br><br>		--------------------<br><br>		[scene change: Edmund is passed out or sleeping at the<br>		 galley table. A knock comes at the door]<br>		 <br>Edmund:		Enter. [Baldrick and Percy come in, carrying bottles. Edmund<br>		sits up and we see he that his face is tired and drawn] So soon?<br><br>Percy:		You said today. [They set the bottles on the table]<br><br>Edmund:		Yes, well, I'm not feeling very thirsty at the moment.<br>		I had an egg-cup full of stagnant water three weeks ago...<br>		Oh all right, come on, let's get on with it. [He stands up]<br><br>Baldrick:	Should we drink each other's or stick to our own?<br><br>Edmund:		Is Captain Rum joining us for this bring-a-sample party,<br>		or is he going to sit this one out?<br><br>Percy:		Oh no, he's been swigging his for ages. He says he likes it.<br>		Actually, come to think of it, he started before the water<br>		ran out.<br><br>Edmund:		Oh, God. [Resigned] Well, let's get on with it.<br><br>		[Caption appears,<br><br>			"Ten Minutes Later"<br>			<br>		 Then, we see the three of them with their backs to<br>		 the camera and their hands apparently in front of them]<br>		 <br>Edmund:		It's always the same, isn't it; you get all keyed up and<br>		then you can't go.<br><br>Baldrick:	I've done two bottles [He turns around and places two<br>		full bottles on the table]<br><br>Blackadder:	All right, then; pour it out. [Laments] That it should come<br>		to this, drinking Baldrick's water. [He holds out a mug and<br>		Baldrick begins to pour]<br><br>Baldrick:	Say when. [Blackadder says "When" almost immediately. Baldrick<br>		clinks bottles with Percy, in a toast, "Down the hatch". They<br>		raise the glasses and are about to drink]<br><br>Rum[offscreen]:	Land Ahoy! [They stagger as the ship hits something]<br><br>Blackadder:	Ah! France at last!<br><br>Rum:		[pops his head in the galley window] No, me young master.<br>		Through fair winds and fine seamanship, our vessel is once more<br>		edged up on the shores of Old Blightey.<br><br>All:		Hooray!<br><br>Rum:		By lucky chance, we have landed at Southampton dock.<br><br>All:		Hooray!<br><br>Rum:		Fare thee well. The last one up the old sea dog gets a lick<br>		of the cat'! [He disappears again, and Baldrick goes to the<br>		window and looks out]<br><br>Baldrick:	Don't look much like Southampton to me, my lord.		<br><br>Blackadder:	What?<br><br>Baldrick:	Well, those streams of molten lava and that steamy<br>		mangrove swamp. [Blackadder and Percy begin to look worried,<br>		and cross over to the window to look] And that crowd of<br>		beckoning natives rubbing their tummies and pointing to<br>		a large pot.<br><br>Blackadder:	[rolling eyes] Oh, God.<br><br>		--------------------<br><br>		[Caption appears,<br><br>			 "Two Years Later"<br>			 <br>		 Then we see a very disgruntled Raleigh wearing a<br>		 dunce's outfit, with the Queen throwing rings at his cap,<br>		 and Melchett and Nursie looking on]<br>		 <br>Queen:		Where are they now?<br><br>Melchett:	Well, Madam, if they haven't been eaten by cannibals,<br>		they should be back any minute now.<br><br>		[The door bursts open and Blackadder, Percy and Baldrick<br>		 make their entrance, bowing to the Queen]<br>		 <br>Edmund:		Ma'am!<br><br>Queen:		[shrieks] Edmund! You're alive!<br><br>Edmund:		[patronizingly, as if to shrug it off] Oh, yes.<br><br>Queen:		And your silly friend.<br><br>Percy:		Lord Percy, Ma'am [bowing again].<br><br>Queen:		And your monkey!<br><br>Baldrick:	[bowing] Your Majesty.<br><br>Queen:		But where is Captain Rum?<br><br>Blackadder:	Uh, bad news, my Lady; Rum is dead. [Nursie screws her face up<br>		and starts to cry]<br><br>Percy:		Do not despair, good woman. He died a hero's death: giving his<br>		life that his friends might live.<br><br>Blackadder:	And that his enemies might have something to go with<br>		their potatoes.<br><br>Nursie:		You mean they put him in the pot?<br><br>Blackadder:	Yes, your fiance was only a third-rate sailor, but a first-rate<br>		second course. [Nursie starts sobbing again] However, we did<br>		manage to save something of him as a memento. [reaches in a<br>		large sack they brought in with them, takes out Rum's beard,<br>		and presents it to Nursie] There.<br><br>Nursie:		Oh, my lucky stars; I shall wear it always, to remind me<br>		of him [she puts it on].<br><br>Blackadder:	However, Ma'am, I am now returned, and my mind cannot<br>		help remembering talk of wedding bells.<br><br>Queen:		No, I am completely bored with explorers! And if you haven't<br>		brought me any presents, I'm going to have you executed!<br><br>Blackadder:	Ma'am?<br><br>Queen:		I only let Raleigh off because he blubbed on his way to the<br>		block. Presents, please!<br><br>Blackadder:	Ah yes, Ma'am. [he backs away, clearly trying to think<br>		of a plan] Um, yes. Well, there was one thing, Ma'am, a <br>		most extraordinary gift from the island paradise we visited.<br><br>Queen:		Hurry up!!<br><br>Blackadder:	[reaches into a sack Percy is holding and draws out a <br>		boomerang and hands it to her]. <br><br>Queen:		What is it?<br><br>Melchett:	A stick.<br><br>Queen:		[threateningly] Is it a stick,, Lord Blackadder? <br><br>Blackadder:	Ah yes, Ma'am, but it is a very special stick. Because<br>		when you throw it away, it comes back!<br><br>Queen:		Well, that's no good, is it; because when *I* throw things<br>		away, I don't *want* them to come back!! [turns to Percy] YOU!!<br>		Get rid of it!<br><br>Percy:		Certainly, Ma'am [meekly takes it from her and tosses it<br>		behind him]<br><br>Queen:		What else have you brought?<br><br>Blackadder:	Um, yes, well, there was very little time what with<br>		picking the weevils out of biscuits and-<br><br>Queen:		-Melchy, what did I do with that spare death warrant?<br><br>		[The boomerang comes back and hits Percy on the head,<br>		 knocking him down. The Queen changes her mind on the stick]<br>		 <br>Queen:		Oh, Edmund, it's wonderful! But what about Melchy and Raleigh?<br>		You must have brought something for them as well. [Edmund<br>		clears his throat trying to think of something] -Nursie's got<br>		her beard, I've got my stick; what about the two boys?<br><br>Blackadder:	[stalling as he turns toward Baldrick and looks into the sack]<br>		Um, yes, well. [Baldrick puts his hand on Blackadder's arm<br>		and they turn slightly, allowing Baldrick to retrieve something<br>		from a satchel at his side] There was one thing, Ma'am...<br><br>Queen:		good...<br><br>		[Baldrick pulls out one of the bottles he filled on the ship<br>		 and hands it to Edmund, so that it looks as though Edmund has<br>		 taken it out of the sack that he supposedly brought "presents"<br>		 in]<br>		 <br>Blackadder:	...A fine wine! [Holds the bottle aloft for all to see] A most<br>		delicious beverage! [He uncorks the bottle and pours out<br>		two tankards for Melchett and Raleigh]<br><br>Queen:		Have a taste, boys, and tell us what you think!<br><br>		[Baldrick hands them the tankards and they "sniff the bouquet"<br>		 and fall over each other trying to praise it to the Queen]<br><br>Raleigh:	Oh, it certainly has plenty of nose!<br>Melchett:	Oh yes, this is very familiar.<br><br>Blackadder:	I'm sure you'll be glad to hear [turns and looks at Baldrick]<br>		that there is an inexhaustible supply!<br><br>		--------------- END ---------------<br><br><br><br>
