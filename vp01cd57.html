<br>A War of Words
<br>
<br>AEDMUND SANDERS & RICHARD SIMON
<br>
<br>The Indian Express, 10 October 2001
<br>
<br>WASHINGTON: FIRST came the bombs. Then the food packets. The third wave of airdrops over Afghanistan will be words. As it has in most other conflicts in recent years, the US military is preparing to drop leaflets and transmit radio broadcasts into Afghanistan as part of a broader psychological war designed to demoralise enemy troops, counter anti-American slogans and muster support among the people.
<br>
<br>''It's not propaganda,'' Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said on Monday on Fox News. ''It's the truth. The truth is that the US and the countries across the globe that are participating with this effort are anxious to stop terrorism.''
<br>
<br>Defense officials said that leaflet drops  -  part of the military's psychological operations, or psyops  -  are expected to begin shortly. They would not comment on the specific text or messages of the campaign. Experts predict the US will strive to convince Afghans that the war is not aimed at them or the Islamic faith.
<br>
<br>Seeking to undermine the loyalty of Taliban troops will be another key goal. ''A lot of these leaflets get wadded up and used for toilet paper, but over time, it's helpful in convincing people that what you're saying is right,'' said William Nash, a retired Army general who now works at the Washington-based Council on Foreign Relations. Because many Afghan citizens are unable to read, the leaflets will use symbols and pictures to help deliver their message, Rumsfeld said. Potential images include photos of innocent bombing victims and maps directing refugees to protective camps.
<br>
<br>The airwaves likely will play a role as well. During the Persian Gulf War and conflicts in Panama and Bosnia, the Air National Guard deployed its EC-130E ''Commando Solo'' aircraft, which serve as flying radio stations, to block enemy signals and transmit US-supported broadcasts. Wind-up portable radios also may be smuggled into the region to increase the potential audience.
<br>
<br>In Congress, lawmakers last week introduced a Bill to set aside $14 million to create a ''Radio Free Afghanistan'' to broadcast in the same way that Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty challenged the Communist monopoly on information in eastern Europe. In the Gulf War, such broadcasts and other psyops tactics led to widespread defections of Saddam Hussein's troops, expert say. ''It was very effective at demoralising the enemy, wearing them down and making sure they didn't get a wink of sleep,'' said Rear Adm. (Ret.) Stephen H. Baker, now a senior fellow at the Center for Defense Information.
<br>
<br>In Iraq, US psyops forces used bullhorns and leaflets to pressure beleaguered Iraqi soldiers into surrendering or retreating. 
<br>
<br>US Special Operations teams smuggled printing presses into Kuwait to publish anti-Iraq pamphlets. One successful tactic involved dropping leaflets warning Iraqi soldiers that certain areas would be bombed in 24 hours. After making good on the threat several times, US forces found that Iraqi soldiers had been conditioned to flee areas as soon as the leaflets were dropped.
<br>
<br>The humanitarian food drops are another way to reinforce the message of the US psyops campaign, experts say. The packages include a picture of the American flag and a message that the packets were sent by the American people.
