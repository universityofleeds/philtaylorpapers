<br>
<br>Interviewed by Tom McGurk on the RTE1 Radio "Sunday Show" on 10 March 2003.
<br>
<br>" Now, Kate Adie, you join us from the BBC in London. Thank you very much for going to all this trouble on a Sunday morning to come and join us. I suppose you are watching with a mixture of emotions this war beginning to happen, because you are not going to be covering it."  
<br>Kate Adie:
<br>  " Oh I will be. And what actually appalls me is the difference between twelve years ago and now. I've seen a complete erosion of any kind of acknowledgment that reporters should be able to report as they witness."
<br>
<br>" The Americans... and I've been talking to the Pentagon ...take the attitude which is entirely hostile to the free spread of information." 
<br>
<br>" I was told by a senior officer in the Pentagon, that if uplinks --that is the television signals out of... Bhagdad, for example-- were detected by any planes ...electronic media... mediums, of the military above Bhagdad... they'd be fired down on. Even if they were journalists ..' Who cares! ' said.. [inaudible] .." 
<br>Tom McGurk: "...Kate ...sorry Kate ..just to underline that. Sorry to interrupt you. Just to explain for our listeners. Uplinks is where you have your own satellite telephone method of distributing information." 
<br>Kate Adie: " The telephones and the television signals." 
<br>Tom McGurk: " And they would be fired on? "  
<br>Kate Adie: " Yes. They would be 'targeted down,' 
<br>said the officer."  
<br>Tom McGurk: " Extraordinary ! "  
<br>

<br>
<br>26 minutes[ Realplayer] 
<br>
<br> Kate Adie: " Shameless! " 
<br>
<br>He said: 
<br>' Well... they know this ...
<br>they've been warned.' 
<br>
<br>This is threatening freedom of information, before you even get to a war.
<br>
<br>The second thing is there was a massive news blackout imposed.
<br>
<br>In the last Gulf war, where I was one of the pool correspondents with the British Army. We effectively had very, very light touch when it came to any kind of censorship.
<br>
<br>We were told that anything which was going to endanger troops lives which we understood we shouldn't broadcast. But other than that, we were relatively free.
<br>
<br>Unlike our American colleagues, who immediately left their pool, after about 48 hours, having just had enough of it.
<br>
<br>And this time the Americans are: a) Asking journalists who go with them, whether they are... have feelings against the war. And therefore if you have views that are skeptical, then you are not to be acceptable.
<br>
<br>Secondly, they are intending to take control of the Americans technical equipment ...those uplinks and satellite phones I was talking about. And control access to the airwaves.
<br>
<br>And then on top of everything else, there is now a blackout (which was imposed, during the last war, at the beginning of the war), ...ordered by one Mr. Dick Cheney, who is in charge of this.
<br>
<br>I am enormously pessimistic of the chance of decent on-the-spot reporting, as the war occurs. You will get it later.
