<br>Money
<br> 
<br>	[In Edmund's bedroom, Edmund is asleep. Beside his head is a pair
<br>         of feet. The owner of the feet is named Mollie.]
<br> 
<br>[knock at door]
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Go away.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: (standing at open doorway) My Lord, there is someone at the door
<br>          to see you.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (wearily) Oh god. What time is it?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: Four o'clock.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Baldrick, I've told you before: you mustn't let me sleep all day;
<br>        this woman charges by the hour.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: No, My Lord, it's four o'clock in the morning.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Someone wants to see me at four in the morning? What is he, a giant
<br>        lark?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: No, he's a priest.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Tell him I'm jewish.
<br> 
<br>Mollie: (pushing herself out from beneath the covers at the foot of the bed)
<br>        Aren't you going to introduce me, then?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: What?
<br> 
<br>Mollie: Aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Oh very well, but I think you're making a terrible mistake. Baldrick,
<br>        I'm delighted to introduce you to ... I'm sorry, I've forgotten your
<br>        name.
<br> 
<br>Mollie: Mollie!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Of course, Mollie. Baldrick, this is Mollie, a dear friend of mine.
<br> 
<br>Mollie: I'm not dear. I'm very reasonable actually, Baldrick. Most girls
<br>        would charge an extra sixpence for all the horrible things he wants
<br>        to do.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Alright, alright. Baldrick, this is Mollie, an inexpensive prostitute.
<br>        Mollie, this is Baldrick, a pointless peasant. Now let me get some
<br>        sleep.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: Well, what about this priest?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Tell him to take his sacred backside out of here, and what's more, if
<br>        he comes begging again, tell him I shall report him to the Bishop of
<br>        Bath and Wells, who drowns babies at their christening and eats them
<br>        in the vestry afterwards.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: Yes, My Lord.
<br> 
<br>Mollie: (sweetly) Bye, Baldrick!
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: (just as so) Bye bye, Mollie!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Get out; go on! (Baldrick leaves) You're a one, aren't you? When you
<br>        should be whispering sweet conversational nothings like "Goodness me,
<br>        something twice the size of the Royal Barge has just hoved into view
<br>        between the sheets," you don't say a word, but enter the Creature
<br>        From The Black Latrine and you won't stop jabbering.
<br> 
<br>Mollie: He was treating me like a human being.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Look, if I had wanted a lecture on the rights of Man, I would have
<br>        gone to bed with Martin Luther.
<br> 
<br>[Baldrick flies through the door, literally, and remains lying on the floor
<br> with door fragments.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (he had just put his head down, and remains so with his eyes closed)
<br>        Yes, what is it, Baldrick?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: It's that priest. He says he still wants to see you.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: And did you mention the baby-eating Bishop of Bath and Wells?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: I did, My Lord.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: And what did he say?
<br> 
<br>Bishop: (enters; shouts) He said, "I *am* the baby-eating Bishop of Bath and
<br>        Wells!"
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (sits up with a start) Good lord!
<br> 
<br>Bishop: You haven't any children, have you, Blackadder.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: No, no, I'm not married.
<br> 
<br>Bishop: In that case, I'll skip breakfast and get straight down to business.
<br>        Do you know what day it is today?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Er...
<br> 
<br>Bishop: It was exactly one year ago to the day that the Bank of the Black
<br>        Monks of St. Herod -- "Banking with a smile and a stab" -- of which
<br>        I am the assistant manager, lent you one thousand pounds. (kneels
<br>        down to be face-to-face with Edmund, who begins cowering) Our motto
<br>        is "Repayment or Revenge."
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Of course, and naturally I'd have paid you back, but -- and this is
<br>        the real bugger -- I've gone and lost my wallet. Has that ever
<br>        happened to you? Disasterous! It had all my things in it: all those
<br>        little notes saying "Forget ye not" and, of course, all my money!
<br> 
<br>Bishop: That's no concern of mine. The debt is now due. Failure to pay back
<br>        a loan is a sin, and we Black Monks, we HATE SIN!
<br> 
<br>[Bishop lifts up the sheets, revealing that Edmund -- dressed in a brief
<br> black loincloth -- is in bed with Mollie.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Ah. Erm, Your Grace, may introduce my mother ...  Mother, this is--
<br> 
<br>Bishop: (recognises Mollie) Good morning, my dear! (sits on the bed) I hope
<br>        you haven't forgotten our appointment.
<br> 
<br>Mollie: (sweetly) Of course not, Pumpy!
<br> 
<br>Bishop: You know, I have a mind, my pretty, to play "Nuns and Novices," so
<br>        don't forget your wimple.
<br> 
<br>Mollie: OK!
<br> 
<br>Bishop: (to Edmund) And, as for you, you come with me.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (stands) Where?
<br> 
<br>Bishop: To visit the last poor fool who (draws his sword) LOST HIS WALLET!
<br>        (hits Edmund's bare buttocks with sword; Edmund runs out)
<br> 
<br> 
<br>	[at graveyard; a mad beggar is dancing around (the same one whom
<br>         Edmund chases in the final credits of each episode).]
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (reading over a tombstone) "William Greeves: born 1513 in Chelshood
<br>        with the love of Christ; died 1563 in ... agony with a spike up his
<br>        bottom."
<br> 
<br>Beggar: (comes behind Edmund) Ah! 'Tis ever (in sown uncle?) with the Black
<br>        Monks! (fondles the tombstone) Oh! Screamed, did he -- scream and
<br>        gurgle as they skewered his catflap for once of a farthing!
<br> 
<br>Bishop: I think you get my message.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (stands; the beggar grabs onto his leg; he tries to shake him off as
<br>        he speaks) Erm, yes, yes indeed. But, tell me, Bishop, let me just
<br>        test the water here, so to speak. Erm, supposing I was to say to you
<br>        something like, "I'm a close friend of the Queen's, and I think she'd
<br>        be very interested to hear about you and Mollie and the wimple, so
<br>        why don't we just call it quits, eh, Fatso?"
<br> 
<br>Bishop: I would say, firstly, "The Queen would not believe you," and,
<br>        secondly, (draws a hot poker) "You'll regret calling me `Fatso',
<br>        later today!"
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Ah.
<br> 
<br>Bishop: I will have my money by Evensong tonight or ...
<br>        YOUR BOTTOM WILL WISH IT HAD NEVER BEEN BORN!!!  (exits)
<br> 
<br>Beggar: (letting go of Edmund's leg finally, stands) Oh! Poor Tom's cold!
<br>        Pity poor Tom, for his nose is frozen, and he does shiver, and
<br>        HE'S MAD! (waving his arms quite dramatically)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Oh shut up! (pushes the beggar into an open grave)
<br> 
<br> 
<br>	(at Edmund's home)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: So, lads, I'm up a certain creek without a certain instrument.
<br>        Either I raise a thousand pounds by this evening, or I get murdered.
<br>        What should I do?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: It's obvious.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: What?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: You'll have to get murdered. You'll never raise that sort of money.
<br> 
<br>Percy: (looks up from his book, waves his handkerchief about, chuckling)
<br>       Oh, come now, Baldrick. A piffling thousand? Pay the fellow, Edmund,
<br>       and damn his impudence.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: I haven't got a thousand, dunghead! I've got 85 quid in the whole
<br>        world! (holds up a small bag)
<br> 
<br>Percy: But you're always boasting to the Queen about how wealthy you are.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Ah, a cunning web of deceit, subtly spun about the court to improve
<br>        my standing, unfortunately.
<br> 
<br>Percy: (stands) What, do you mean you've been ... fibbing?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (sits in chair by the door) Yep. My whole life has been a tissue of
<br>        whoppers. I consider myself one of England's finest liars. (looks out
<br>        the door) Oh, my god, Percy! A giant hummingbird is about to eat your
<br>        hat and cloak!
<br> 
<br>Percy: Oh no! (runs out)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (to Baldrick) You see? I'm terrific at it.
<br> 
<br>Percy: (comes back) It seems to have gone now. Well, couldn't you just dip 
<br>       into the family fortune?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: There isn't one. My father blew it all on wine, women and amateur
<br>        dramatics. At the end, he was eking out of a living doing
<br>        humourous impressions of Anne of Cleeves.
<br> 
<br>Percy: (sympathetic) Oh, Edmund, I am sorry -- I had no idea. But do not
<br>       despair, for I have some small savings carefully harvested from my
<br>       weekly allowance, set aside against my frail old age. By lucky haps,
<br>       it is just over a thousand, methinks, and has for years has been
<br>       hidden beyond the wit of any thief, in an old sock...
<br> 
<br>Edmund and Percy: ...under the squeaky floorboard...
<br> 
<br>Baldrick, Edmund and Percy: ...behind the kitchen dresser.
<br> 
<br>Percy: (smiles, slightly warily) You've seen it!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Seen it, pinched it, spent it. And same goes for the two farthings
<br>        Baldrick thinks he's got hidden inside that mouldy potato.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: Oh, bloody hell!
<br> 
<br>Percy: Then you are doomed. Alas. For God's sake, let us sit upon the carpet
<br>       (sits on the floor) and tell sad stories.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Certainly not! When Lord Blackadder is in trouble, he does not sit 
<br>        about.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: You won't be able to sit about with a spike up your bottom.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Well, exactly. (sits at his desk) But still, I've got 85 quid and
<br>        that's a start. I'm sure I'll think of something, as long as I'm not
<br>        disturbed.
<br> 
<br>[a messenger enters]
<br> 
<br>Messenger: My Lord, the Queen dost demand your urget presence on pain
<br>           of death.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Oh god! The path of my life is strewn with cowpats from the Devil's
<br>        own Satanic herd!
<br> 
<br> 
<br>	[Edmund walks briskly up the hall and enters court.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Madam, you sent for me...
<br> 
<br>Queen: (playing chess with Melchett) Did I? I don't remember.
<br>       What a naughty scatterbrain I am! (makes a move on the
<br>       chess board) Zap! (takes off one of Melchett's pieces)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Well, perhaps, Ma'am, if I might be allowed to withdraw, I have one
<br>        or two tiny matters to attend to.
<br> 
<br>Queen: Certainly.
<br> 
<br>[Edmund bows, turns, and opens the doors. Melchett, Queen and Nursie break
<br> into laughter. Edmund turns back.]
<br> 
<br>Queen: That was a terrific joke, wasn't it?
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Oh, magnificent!
<br> 
<br>Nursie: And so naughty!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: What, My Lady?
<br> 
<br>Queen: I do know why I wanted to see you, and I just pretended I didn't,
<br>       and I fooled you. And it worked brilliantly, didn't it!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: It was terrific, Madam. I thank God I wore my corset, because
<br>        I think my sides have split. So why *did* you want to see me?
<br> 
<br>Queen: To crack the lovely joke.
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Or perhaps, Blackadder, you don't think the Queen's jokes are
<br>          funny enough for you to be troubled with.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Au contraire. I'm ecstatic about the whole incident. I only didn't
<br>	laugh out loud because I was afraid if I did, my head would've
<br>	fallen off.
<br> 
<br>Queen: If you don't start soon, your head *will* fall off! (all laugh) Now 
<br>       pay Melchy his 85 pounds and run along.
<br> 
<br>[Melchett, sitting on the floor, his back to Edmund, holds out his hand.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund: 85 pounds?
<br> 
<br>Queen: We had a bet. I said that you wouldn't fall for my trick, and Melchy
<br>       said you would because I'm so super and you're so stupid. So you owe
<br>       him 85 pounds.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Fine, fine. I mean, it's only money, isn't it! (gives it to Melchett)
<br> 
<br> 
<br>	[Edmund's house, in hallway. Baldrick is sweeping the floor.
<br>         Edmund enters.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund: I can *not* believe it! She drags me all the way from Billingsgate to
<br>        Richmond to play about the weakest practical joke since Cardinal
<br>        Woolsey got his knob out at Hampton Court and stood at the end of
<br>        the passage pretending to be a door.
<br> 
<br>[Baldrick giggles]
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Oh, shut up, Baldrick -- you'd laugh at a Shakespeare comedy.
<br> 
<br>Percy: (rushes out of the living room) Edmund, oh Edmund, I've awaited your
<br>        return! (hugs him)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: And thank God you did, for I was just thinking, "My god! I die in 12
<br>        hours. What I really need now is a hug from a complete prat!"
<br>        (enters the living room)
<br> 
<br>Percy: But fear not, for I have a plan to save the life of my dear dear
<br>       friend.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Look, I'm not interested in your bloody friends! What about me?
<br> 
<br>Percy: (giggles) Not bad, Edmund. That's a good one.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Oh, alright, then. (sits) What's your big plan, blockhead?
<br> 
<br>Percy: I intend to discover, this very afternoon, the secret of alchemy --
<br>       the hidden art of turning base things into gold.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: I see, and the fact that this secret has eluded the most intelligent
<br>        people since the dawn of time doesn't dampen your spirits at all.
<br> 
<br>Percy: Oh no; I like a challenge! (exits, as Baldrick pours a drink)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Well, Balders, I lost the 85 quid. The grave opens up before me
<br>        like a ... big hole in the ground.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: (gives the cup to Edmund) Well, I did have one idea, My Lord,
<br>          but ... nah, it's stupid, you wouldn't... (turns to leave)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: What is it?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: (turns back) Well, I have heard there's good money to be made down
<br>          the docks, doing favours for sailors.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Favours? What do you mean? Delivering messages, sewing on buttons --
<br>        that kind of thing?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: Erm, not quite.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (starts to stand) Baldrick!
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: My Lord?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Are you suggesting that I become a rent boy?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: Well, good-looking bloke like you, posh accent, nice legs -- you
<br>          can make a (bomb?). Just stick a pink carnation in your hat and,
<br>          er, make the old sign.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: I'd rather die.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: Oh, fair enough, that's all right, then. I'll just put the kettle
<br>          on while we wait, shall I? (turns to leave)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (reaches out and grabs Baldrick's shoulder, turning him round)
<br>        On second thought, with a slight alteration, your sick and sordid
<br>        plan might just work.
<br> 
<br> 
<br>	[at docks, Baldrick is dressed in Edmund's clothes. His hat has
<br>         a pink carnation in it, and he holds a sign reading "GET -IT- HERE."
<br>         He bounces seductively as a burly sailor named Arthur strides up.]
<br> 
<br>Arthur: Give me a kiss and I'll give you a penny.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (comes from round the corner) A penny?!
<br> 
<br>Arthur: Well, alright then -- tuppence!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Oh, all right, go on. (disappears behind the corner)
<br> 
<br>Arthur: Nothing fancy. Just a peck. I miss my mum, you see. When I a little
<br>        kid, my mother always used to come up--
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (appears) Look, get a move on! He's a prostitute, not an agony aunt!
<br> 
<br>Arthur: Go on, please! Just a little peck on the cheek, and say, "There
<br>        there, Arthur -- Mummy'll kiss it better, and you shall have a
<br>        story."
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Well, I don't know. Do you do requests, Baldrick?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: What, kinky stuff? Yeah, I'm game.
<br> 
<br>Arthur: Oh, go on, please! (crying) I miss my mother so much. I mean, she
<br>        was like a mother to me!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Well, alright, go on, Baldrick. (disappears)
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: (starts to reach up to Arthur's cheek, but pauses) I've forgotten
<br>          what I'm supposed to say.
<br> 
<br>[Arthur cries]
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (appears, fed up) Get out of the way; I'll do it. (takes the sign)
<br>        There there, Arthur (*smooch*). Mummy kiss it better, and you shall
<br>        have a story.
<br> 
<br>Arthur: (excited) What kind of a story?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Well, I don't know ... one about a squirrel, I suppose.
<br> 
<br>	[some time later]
<br> 
<br>Edmund: ...and then Squirry the Squirrel went...
<br> 
<br>Arthur and Baldrick: (everyone has their arms around each other)
<br>                     ..."Neep neep neep!"...
<br> 
<br>Edmund: ...and they all went home for tea.
<br> 
<br>Arthur: Ah, thanks very much, me ol' shivering mateys! That was wonderful.
<br>        (turns to Edmund) Now then, how much do you charge for a good
<br>        hard shag?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (nervous) A thousand pounds.
<br> 
<br>Arthur: A thousand pounds? You've got to be joking!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Well, I'm sure we could negotiate. (tosses the sign to Baldrick)
<br> 
<br>[Arthur smiles at Baldrick]
<br> 
<br> 
<br>	[back at Edmund's house]
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Right, so we've got sixpence.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: Yeah, now all we need to do, My Lord, is to go down the cockfights
<br>          and put it on a bird that's a dead cert but has got odds of forty
<br>          thousand to one.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Know you of such a bird?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: No. But we could make one.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: No we couldn't, Baldrick. Oh god, I suppose you have to be told
<br>        sometime. Sit down. What happens is: a mummy bird and a daddy bird
<br>        who love each other very much get certain urges...
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: No, no, My Lord. What I mean is: we could get a mad wild killer
<br>          bull, and disguise it as a bird, but it'll be such a strange-looking
<br>          bird that no-one will back it, but we'll know it's a killer bull so
<br>          we'll put money on it.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Only we will know.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: Yeah -- if we stick enough feathers on it and hang an egg between
<br>          its legs.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Yes, alright, alright, Baldrick. A chat with you and somehow death
<br>        loses its sting.
<br> 
<br>Messenger: (enters) My Lord, the Queen dost demand your presence on pain of
<br>           death.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: You're not making any friends here, you do know that, don't you,
<br>        messenger!
<br> 
<br> 
<br>	[Edmund runs up the hall and enters court.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Madam, you sent for me again.
<br> 
<br>Queen: Yes, Edmund. I wanted to apologise for the silly trick I played on you.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Ah.
<br> 
<br>Queen: It was naughty and bad of me.
<br> 
<br>Nursie: It was, my little rosebud. If you weren't quite so big, it'd be
<br>        time for Mr. and Mrs. Spank to pay a short sharp trip to Bottyland.
<br> 
<br>Queen: Thank you, Nursie. And thank you, Edmund.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: That's all...
<br> 
<br>Queen: Yes. Thanks for coming. (extends her hand to him vertically (to shake))
<br> 
<br>[Edmund quickly turns and opens the doors; court party cracks up as before.]
<br> 
<br>Queen: That was very funny too, wasn't it?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: My Lady?
<br> 
<br>Queen: Dragging you all the way across town again just to say sorry for
<br>       dragging you all the way across town the first time! (stops laughing)
<br>       It was Melchett's idea. I think it's wonderful, don't you?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: It's fantastic. Melchett, I prostrate myself at the feet of the
<br>        world's greatest living comedian. (bows)
<br> 
<br>Queen: Oh, you are super, Edmund. Oh, Edmund, erm, I promised Lord Melchett
<br>       that I would play [Sharp?] Halfpenny with him, but we have no coin.
<br>       Do you have a halfpenny?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Unfortunately, only a sixpence, Ma'am. What a shame!
<br> 
<br>Queen: Oh, no -- a sixpence will do just as well. (holds out her hand)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Oh, good! (hands it over)
<br> 
<br> 
<br>	[back home, Edmund enters the hallway, which is full of smoke]
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Oh god, this place stinks like a pair of armoured trousers after the 
<br>        Hundred Years War! Baldrick, have you been eating dung again?
<br> 
<br>Percy: (rushes out the living room, dirtied) My Lord! Success!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: What?
<br> 
<br>Percy: (drags Edmund into the living room) After literally an hour's
<br>       ceaseless searching, I have succeeded in creating gold. PURE GOLD!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Are you sure?
<br> 
<br>Percy: Yes, My Lord! Behold! (uncovers the top; their faces get bathed in
<br>       green light)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Percy, it's green.
<br> 
<br>Percy: That's right, My Lord.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Yes, Percy, I don't want to be pedantic or anything, but the colour
<br>        of gold is gold -- that's why it's called gold. What you have dis-
<br>        covered, if it has a name, is some green.
<br> 
<br>Percy: (stupefied; picks up the green) Oh, Edmund, can it be true? that I
<br>       hold here, in my mortal hand, a nugget of purest green?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Indeed you do, Percy, except, of course, it's not only a nugget as
<br>        it is more of a splat.
<br> 
<br>Percy: Well, yes, a splat today, but tomorrow, who knows? or dares to dream!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: So we three alone in all the world can create the finest green
<br>        at will.
<br> 
<br>Percy: Thus so! (whispers) I'm not sure about counting in Baldrick, actually.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Of course, you know what your great discovery means, don't you,
<br>        Percy.
<br> 
<br>Percy: (smiles) Perhaps, My Lord.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: That you, Percy -- Lord Percy -- are an utter berk!  Baldrick!
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: My Lord?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Pack my bags; I'm going to sell the house.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick and Percy: (shocked) What?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: There's nothing else for it. I mean, I shall miss the old place, I
<br>        know. I've had some happy times here, when you and Percy have been
<br>	out. But needs must when the devil vomits into your kettle. Baldrick,
<br>	go forth into the streets and let it be known that Lord Blackadder
<br>	wishes to sell his house. Percy, just go forth into the street.
<br> 
<br> 
<br>	[Later, Edmund shows his place to a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Pants]
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (coming in) ...and this is the den.
<br> 
<br>Mrs: (looks around) Ooh, dear.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: But I have to tell you, Mr. Pants, that I've had an extremely
<br>        encouraging nibble from another client, and I think you know me
<br>        well enough to know that I'm not the sort of man to ignore a nibble
<br>        for long.
<br> 
<br>Mrs: I noticed some dry rot in the bedrooms, Timothy.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Well, Mrs. Pants, dry rot is what dry rot does. (to Mr. Pants) Stop
<br>        me if I'm getting too technical.
<br> 
<br>[Mr. Pants starts to speak, but is interrupted.]
<br> 
<br>Mrs: And the floor (??) is a little uneven.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Indeed yes, Madam, and at no extra cost!
<br> 
<br>Mrs: Strange smell.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Yes, that's the servant; he'll be gone.
<br> 
<br>Mr: You've really worked out your banter, haven't you?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: No, not really. This is a different thing. It's spontaneous and it's
<br>        called `wit'.
<br> 
<br>Mrs: What about the privies?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: When the master craftsman who created this home was looking at the
<br>        sewage, he said to himself, "Romeo," -- for 'twas his name -- "Romeo,
<br>        let's make them functional, and comfortable."
<br> 
<br>Mr: Oh, well, that seems nice, doesn't it, Dear!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: I think we understand each other, sir. So it's sold, then. (goes to
<br>        a pot and pours into a cup) Drink?
<br> 
<br>Mrs: (insistent for a real answer) What about the privies?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (doesn't give away either of the two cups he holds) Well, what we're
<br>        talking about in, erm, privy terms is the very latest in front-wall,
<br>        fresh-air orifices, combined with a wide-capacity gutter installation
<br>        below.
<br> 
<br>Mrs: You mean you crap out of the window.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Yes!
<br> 
<br>Mrs: Well! In that case, we'll *definitely* take it! (takes a cup from Edmund)
<br>     I can't stand those dirty indoor things.
<br> 
<br> 
<br>	[later, Edmund counts the money]
<br> 
<br>Edmund: There, that's the lot. He only wanted to pay a thousand, but I
<br>        managed to beat him up to eleven hundred.
<br> 
<br>Percy: Oh, Edmund, you wily old trickster, you!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Oh, credit where credit's due -- I just named the price; it was
<br>        Baldrick who actually beat him up.
<br> 
<br>[Percy nods]
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Percy, what is that on the front of your tunic?
<br> 
<br>Percy: Ah! 'tis a brooch, My Lord -- a brooch cunningly fashioned from
<br>       pure green.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: It looks like you've sneezed.
<br> 
<br>Percy: It is with trinkets such as this brooch, and here, a ring, that I
<br>       intend to revive your fortunes and buy back your house!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: You think there's a big market for jewelry that looks like snot, then?
<br> 
<br>Percy: (upset) My Lord!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: The eyes are open, the mouth moves, but Mr. Brain has long since
<br>        departed, hasn't he, Perce.
<br> 
<br>Messenger: (enters) My Lord--
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Ah, messenger, thank God you came. Percy and I could not have waited
<br>        another second without you.
<br> 
<br> 
<br>	[Edmund sprints up the hall and enters court, where the trio is
<br>         hunched over a war map]
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Majesty!
<br> 
<br>Queen: Thank God you've arrived -- terrible news!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: What?
<br> 
<br>Melchett: The French intend to invade, Blackadder.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: My god!
<br> 
<br>Queen: So I need some money.
<br> 
<br>[Edmund, fearing the worst, falls down into the throne]
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Yes, every nobleman must pay 500 pounds towards the upkeep of the 
<br>          navies.
<br> 
<br>Queen: But we've decided to make you a special case.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (sitting up a bit) Oh, thank you, Ma'am!
<br> 
<br>Queen: Melchy here hasn't got a bean, so we thought, as you're so fabulously
<br>       wealthy, you could pay for both!
<br> 
<br>Melchett: It would be awfully sweet of you.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Yes, well, unfortunately, Ma'am, I'm in the middle of a cash-flow
<br>        crisis and I just haven't got any money on me!
<br> 
<br>Queen: (looking down at him) But, Edmund...
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (realises that he's in the throne, expecting that this is what she
<br>        is addressing him about) Sorry. (stands and moves across to his
<br>        proper place)
<br> 
<br>Queen: ...what's that in your tights?  (points her figurine-moving stick
<br>       at his groin)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Oh, good lord. (he takes out a pouch)
<br> 
<br>Queen: It looks like ... just over a thousand pounds!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: So it is.
<br> 
<br>Queen: I thought you said you didn't have any.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Oh, I thought you meant *real* money. This is just a bit of loose
<br>        change. I must have left it in my codpiece when I sent these tights
<br>        to the laundry.
<br> 
<br>Queen: Gosh, a thousand pounds just loose in your tights... That *is* flash!
<br>       OK, hand it over. (he does) Thanks. 'bye. (turns back to the map,
<br>       making whistles and `boom' noises as she plays with the figurines)
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Well, goodbye indeed. (backs out of the room slowly) 'bye, Ma'am.
<br>        Goodbye, Melchett. Goodbye, Nursie. Byeee... (shuts the doors)
<br> 
<br>[Melchett peeks between doors to make sure he's gone; all crack up once more;
<br> Melchett falls to the floor; Nursie claps her hands; Queen falls onto
<br> Melchett; Nursie goes to her knees]
<br> 
<br>Queen: Silly old Edmund! He was completely fooled! That was a brilliant
<br>       joke, Melchy!
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Brilliant, Ma'am!
<br> 
<br>Queen: (serious suddenly) And now I'm going to have you executed. (stands)
<br> 
<br>Melchett: (stammering) Majesty?
<br> 
<br>Queen: It's for taking the mickey out of my beloved Edmund so cruelly.
<br>       I'm gonna knock your block off.
<br> 
<br>Melchett: (begging) But, Majesty, I only intended to please! Oh, please!
<br>          I so want to live!!!
<br> 
<br>[Queen slowly breaks into laughter]
<br> 
<br>Nursie: Ooh! (slaps Queen's hand)
<br> 
<br>Melchett: Ah! (laughs forcedly)
<br> 
<br>[Nursie falls over; Queen falls onto her]
<br> 
<br>Melchett: (still faking a laugh, but obviously rather frightened and angry)
<br>          Praise the Lord for the gift of laughter!
<br> 
<br> 
<br>	[Edmund rushes into his living room]
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Right, Balders, I've lost the money. I'm going to have to run away.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: Why, My Lord?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: To avoid these monks, of course!
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: No point -- the Black Bank's got branches everywhere.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Oh damn! (falls to the floor) If I die, Baldrick, do you think people
<br>        would remember me?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: (stepping over Edmund as he continues packing) Yeah, of course they
<br>          would.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Yes, I suppose so.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: Yeah. People would always be slapping each other on the shoulders
<br>          and laughing, and saying "Do you remember old Privy-breath?"
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Do people call me `Privy-breath'?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: Yeah, the ones who like you.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Am I then not popular?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: Erm, well, put it this way: when people slip in what dogs have left
<br>          in the street, they do tend to say "Whoops, I've trod on an Edmund."
<br> 
<br>Edmund: (stands) Bloody cheek! I'll show them. 
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: What, have you got a plan, My Lord?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Yes I have, and it's so cunning you could brush your teeth with
<br>        it! All I need is some feathers, a dress, some oil, an easel, some
<br>        sleeping draught, lots of paper, a prostitute and the best portrait
<br>        painter in England.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: I'll get them right away, My Lord! (rushes out)
<br> 
<br> 
<br>	[later, enter Baldrick and painter]
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: My Lord, the most famous painter in England: Mr. Leonardo Acropolis.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Right, are you any good?
<br> 
<br>Leonardo: (turns away, speaks in silly Italian accent) No! I am ... a genius!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Well, you'd better be, or you're dead!
<br> 
<br>[Leonardo sticks out his tongue; there's pounding on the front door]
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Right, in the bedroom, Beardface. Baldrick, get the door.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: My Lord.
<br> 
<br>[Baldrick and Leonardo leave; Edmund shuts the door behind them and then
<br> sits down, puts his feet up, and begins reading a book.  Baldrick flies
<br> through the door, again quite literally, and lies on the floor with the
<br> shrapnel.]
<br> 
<br>Baldrick: My Lord, the Bishop of Bath and Wells.
<br> 
<br>Bishop: (enters) The time has come, Blackadder!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Oh, hello, Bish.
<br> 
<br>Bishop: The Black Monks will have their money, or I will have my fun.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: You enjoy your work, don't you?
<br> 
<br>Bishop: Bits of it, yeah.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: The violent bits.
<br> 
<br>Bishop: Yes. (begins massaging Edmund's shoulders) You see, I am a colossal
<br>        pervert. No form of sexual depravity is too low for me. Animal,
<br>        vegetable or mineral -- I'll do anything to anything.
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Fine words for a Bishop. It's nice to hear the Church speaking out
<br>        for a change on social issues. 
<br> 
<br>Bishop: Have you got the money?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Nope.
<br> 
<br>Bishop: Good. I hate it when people pay up. Say your prayers, Blackadder.
<br>        (holds out the hot poker) IT'S POKER TIME!!!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Fine. (closes the book and sets it down, then stands) Are you ever
<br>        concerned that people might find you out?
<br> 
<br>Bishop: No. No, no, I kill, I maim, I fornicate, but as far as my flock is
<br>        concerned my only vice is a little tibble before Evensong. (Baldrick
<br>        hands him a drink) Oh, thank you. (drinks) BEND OVER, BLACKADDER!
<br> 
<br>[Edmund complies]
<br> 
<br>Bishop: THIS IS WHERE YOU GET-- (staggers backward, choking) DRUGGED BY GOD!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: No, by Baldrick, actually, but the effect is much the same.
<br> 
<br> 
<br>	[in bedroom; Edmund pulls open a curtain, behind which Bishop
<br>         lies in bed]
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Wakey, wakey, Bish. Dear me, you clerics really are sluggerbeds.
<br> 
<br>Bishop: (groggy) Where am I? I remember...drugged...
<br> 
<br>Edmund: That's right.
<br> 
<br>Bishop: You should have killed me while you had the chance. (sits up)
<br>        You have looked in wonder at your last dawn, Blackadder!
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Well, I'm not sure about that. I did wonder, though, what people who
<br>        saw this might think.
<br> 
<br>[Baldrick stands nearby, holding a portrait]
<br> 
<br>Bishop: Heavens above, what creatures from Hell are those?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: They make an interesting couple, don't they? I think you probably
<br>        recognise this huge, sweating mound of blubber here, eh, Fatso?
<br> 
<br>[Bishop charges toward the portrait, but Edmund pushes him back to the bed]
<br> 
<br>Edmund: There's no point, anyway; we have the peliminary sketches. We'll
<br>        soon bang off a couple of copies. Let's see, one for the Queen, one
<br>        for the Archbishop, a couple kept aside, perhaps, to form the basis
<br>        of an exciting exhibition of a challenging young artist's work.
<br> 
<br>Bishop: By the horns of Beelzebub, how did you get me into that position?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: It's beautifully framed, don't you think? which is ironic, really,
<br>        because that's exactly what's happened to you.
<br> 
<br>Bishop: You fiend! Never have I encountered such corrupt and foul-minded
<br>        perversity! Have you ever considered a career in the Church?
<br> 
<br>Edmund: No, I could never get used to the underwear.
<br> 
<br>[Bishop nods in apprehension]
<br> 
<br>Edmund: What I could use, though, is, let's say eleven hundred pounds to buy
<br>        back my house, four thousand pounds to cover some sundry expenses,
<br>        ten shillings for the two doors, and let's say throppence for a
<br>        celebratory slapper binge at Mrs. Miggins' pie shop...  (last bit
<br>        said to Baldrick)
<br> 
<br>[Baldrick smiles and nods]
<br> 
<br>Bishop: Yes, yes, but first, one question: Who is this second figure? Who
<br>        could you have got to have performed such deeds, to have gone lower
<br>        than man has ever gone, to have plunged the depths of degradation
<br>        just in order to save your filthy life?!!!
<br> 
<br>[From beneath the covers, Percy wakes and sits up.  He is dressed in red
<br> leather with chains and assorted items.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund: Ah, Percy, may I introduce His Grace, the Bishop of Bath and Wells. 
<br>        Your Grace, Lord Percy Percy, Heir to the Duchy of Northumberland.
<br> 
<br>Percy: (speaks weakly) Hello. (shakes Bishop's hand) It was lovely working
<br>       with you.
<br> 
<br>	[As the theme music plays, the bard dances down the path.  Edmund
<br>         walks a short distance behind, and puts his hands on his hips as
<br>         he looks back at the camera.  Edmund then walks again toward the
<br>         bard, who then continues moving down the path.  Edmund motions for
<br>         him to stop, but he doesn't.  Edmund begins to trot as the bard
<br>         dances around to behind the fountain.  Edmund begins to jog as
<br>         the bard dances down the path further.  Edmund runs, but the bard
<br>         still eludes him as he half dances, half runs down the path, into
<br>         the distance.]
