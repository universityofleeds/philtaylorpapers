            <P>BAGHDAD, Iraq, April 22, 2003 &#8212; Soldiers with the 318th 
            Psychological Operations Company, attached to the 101st Airborne 
            Division (Air Assault), set out to Baghdad, Apr. 19 to conduct 
            operations concerning the civilian population.</P>
            <P>&#8220;The mission was to go out to different sites, talk about the 
            curfew in effect and distribute radios to people who can communicate 
            with the population,&#8221; said Sgt. 1st Class Duane McCrum, 318th PSYOP 
            Co. </P>
            <P>The team drove into marketplaces to spread the word and other 
            locations where larger groups of people were present. Once there, 
            they used a loud speaker mounted on top of their Humvee to convey 
            information regarding the curfew. </P>
            <P>&#8220;The curfew is in effect for the safety and security of the 
            people,&#8221; McCrum said. &#8220;Only essential personnel such as police, 
            firemen and other public safety officials are allowed to be out 
            between the hours of 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. as long as they are doing 
            their job.&#8221; All other persons out in these hours will be detained, 
            according to McCrum. The coalition forces will enforce the curfew at 
            first, to be replaced later by local police, McCrum added.</P>
            <P>When they came to a stop, people began to gather around the 
            vehicle, and when the loudspeaker starting spouting words, the crowd 
            grew more quickly. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD>

            <P>On one stop in the city, some people came forward who were 
            identified as potential key communicators. These people were given 
            radios to receive instructions about what to do and what not to do. 
            &#8220;It&#8217;s for their own safety,&#8221; McCrum said. </P>
            <P>Along with the radios, the key communicators were given pamphlets 
            that contained frequencies written in Arabic where they could 
            receive information.</P>
            <P>Soldiers also handed out leaflets containing information about 
            the curfew. The people, especially the children didn&#8217;t seem to care 
            what it was they were getting, only that they were getting something 
            from an American soldier. </P>
            <P>Within minutes, most of the leaflets had been distributed. </P>
            <P>Though the 318th came back to base with many radios 
            undistributed, they were still satisfied with the outcome of the 
            mission.</P>
            <P>&#8220;I think it was very successful,&#8221; said McCrum said. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t 
            get to do exactly what the assigned mission was, but I think we did 
            meet the intent of the mission, which was to get the word out.&#8221;</P>
            <P>Many seemed to be curious about the curfew, but many others came 
            to complain about issues facing the city community. </P>
            <P>&#8220;One man came up to us and asked who would pay him if he were 
            [not able] to go back to work,&#8221; McCrum said. &#8220;Another man told us 
            that he worked for the government and didn&#8217;t know if there was a job 
            for him to go back to.&#8221;</P></TD></TR><!-- df-article-highlight1 --><!-- /df-article-highlight1 --></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><!-- /main-body -->
