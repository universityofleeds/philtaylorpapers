            width=250 align=right vspace=5 border=0> <SPAN class=normal>An April 
            ceasefire brought an end to Angola's brutal 27-year civil war, but 
            not to the extreme suffering of the Angolan people. Peace revealed 
            one of the worst nutritional emergencies seen in Africa in a decade. 
            Civilians emerged from formerly inaccessible regions of the country 
            desperately seeking food and relief only to find a government 
            largely indifferent to their plight and a slow ineffectual response 
            from the international aid community. Having barely survived years 
            of violence deliberately perpetrated against civilians by both the 
            UNITA rebels and the Angolan government, including forced 
            displacements, rape, and summary executions, Angolans now perished 
            from starvation and disease in this enormous man-made catastrophe. 
            In government-controlled Chipindo, for example, traditional leaders 
            reported that in the first half of the year, nearly 4,000 people had 
            died from an initial population of roughly 18,000. A May survey in 
            MSF's therapeutic feeding center in Malange, revealed that 6 out of 
            10 women had lost a child to hunger in the past four months. By the 
            end of 2002, the nutritional situation had improved, but with an 
            estimated four million people displaced, a destroyed infrastructure, 
            a landscape littered with millions of land mines (7 aid workers and 
            patients, including 4 MSF staff, were killed in a landmine accident 
            in December), inadequate mine-clearing activities, and continuing 
            government intransigence, the desperate struggle for Angolans is far 
            from over. </SPAN></P>

            width=250 align=right vspace=5 border=0> <SPAN class=normal>2002 saw 
            a dramatic escalation of the conflict in Colombia following the 
            collapse of peace negotiations between the government and FARC 
            rebels. Against a background of widespread poverty and weakened 
            public services, the war is affecting civilians in both urban and 
            rural areas. Throughout the country, some 25,000 people are murdered 
            and another 3,000 kidnapped every year. Since 1985, an estimated 2 
            million Colombians have been displaced - nearly half within the past 
            two years - flooding urban centers to escape the escalating violence 
            in the countryside. For those left behind, extreme isolation has 
            intensified. Rural health posts have been abandoned, hospital 
            services have become sporadic, and many rural residents forego 
            seeking medical treatment out of a well-founded fear of traveling. 
            As a result, preventable diseases such as measles have made a 
            comeback, and outbreaks of malaria have been recorded. As right-wing 
            paramilitaries, left-wing rebels and government forces become 
            further entrenched, the situation for civilians will continue its 
            downward spiral.</SPAN></P>

            <P><SPAN class=normal>Despite a peace deal and the withdrawal of 
            some foreign armies, war continues to wreak havoc on the Democratic 
            Republic of Congo (DRC). The consequences are particularly 
            devastating along the ceasefire line and in the east, where an 
            estimated one in four children dies before reaching the age of five. 
            For the survivors, the conflict exacts a chilling and steep price. 
            An estimated 2.5 million people have been displaced from their 
            homes, and, for years, civilians throughout the country have been 
            subjected to indiscriminate violence, rape, abduction, and killings. 
            Meningitis, measles, malaria, and tuberculosis needlessly kill 
            hundreds of thousands of people every year; alarming levels of 
            malnutrition have been recorded in North Kivu province; and a 
            cholera outbreak in Katanga province, where 25,000 cases have been 
            counted since September 2001, has only added to the death toll. The 
            country's ravaged infrastructure cannot begin to address these 
            soaring health needs. In many parts of DRC, hospitals have ceased to 
            function, while some districts have only one or two doctors serving 
            hundreds of thousands of people. </SPAN></P>

            <P><SPAN class=normal>Although North Korea remains one of the 
            largest recipients of food aid in the world, its people continue to 
            suffer from a severe lack of access to adequate food supplies. As a 
            result, many North Koreans, mainly from the northern provinces, 
            continue to risk arrest and imprisonment attempting to cross the 
            border into China in search of a means to survive. Even population 
            groups such as children, pregnant women, and the elderly, who are 
            specifically targeted for assistance by the United Nations World 
            Food Program, are being denied food aid. In February 2002, an MSF 
            team met with 12 North Korean children between the ages of 6 and 15 
            who had recently arrived in China. None of them had ever received 
            food at primary school and they were often too weak and hungry to 
            attend school. Delivery of food aid to the most vulnerable 
            populations is not independently monitored. Those North Koreans 
            desperate enough to seek food, medicine, or refuge in China face 
            enormous obstacles. Considered illegal migrants, they live in hiding 
            and risk fines, arrest, and forceful repatriation - in contravention 
            of the 1951 Refugee Convention that China has ratified - as well as 
            severe repercussions upon their return to North Korea. Despite its 
            mandate to protect refugees, the United Nations High Commissioner 
            for Refugees has done little to stop forced repatriations of North 
            Korean refugees in China or to provide adequate humanitarian 
            assistance or protection to them.</SPAN></P>

            class=normal>Throughout 2002, civil war raged between Charles 
            Taylor's government troops and rebels from the Liberians United for 
            Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) in Liberia's northern Lofa 
            region. Fighting has forced as many as 250,000 civilians to flee 
            Liberia and seek refuge in neighboring Guinea, Sierra Leone, and 
            Ivory Coast - almost 90,000 fled during 2002 alone. In addition, 
            there are at least 80,000 internally displaced persons living in 
            camps in Liberia and an unknown number of civilians still trapped in 
            conflict-riddled Lofa County. Many Liberians have been uprooted 
            multiple times in the past decade and have suffered at the hands of 
            the LURD and government forces, both of which have perpetrated 
            violations of international humanitarian and refugee law with 
            virtual impunity in front of an indifferent international community. 
            Refugees and displaced persons throughout the region have described 
            enduring extortion, rape, forced conscription, labor, and 
            repatriation to war zones, beatings, and imprisonment as they have 
            sought assistance. Many displaced persons and residents struggle to 
            survive in rural areas, particulary in the Lofa County region, where 
            insecurity makes access to humanitarian assistance next to 
            impossible. In Liberia's capital Monrovia, most of the buildings 
            destroyed by civil war in the early 90s still lie in ruins. Public 
            hospitals and health services have all but stopped functioning, 
            except for where assisted by international agencies, and there is a 
            severe lack of potable water, a situation that is not likely to 
            improve as long as a significant portion of the national budget is 
            diverted to the conflict rather than to improving the living 
            conditions of the population.</SPAN></P>

            <P><SPAN class=normal>Twelve years of near continuous warfare have 
            brutalized the civilian population of Somalia, exposing them to 
            injury, disease, displacement, and hunger. War-related injuries and 
            deaths, including those caused by the millions of landmines in the 
            country, have remained consistently high throughout the past decade. 
            In Galcayo Hospital alone, MSF treats approximately 500 war injury 
            cases per month. Regular outbreaks of epidemic diseases such as 
            cholera, tuberculosis, malaria, and kala azar, plus a chronic food 
            shortage, contribute to, according to the UN, the death of nearly a 
            quarter of all children before their fifth year and an average life 
            expectancy of only 46 years. Despite the enormous needs, the public 
            health care system is in a shambles and trained staff, medicines, 
            and equipment are severely lacking. MSF estimates that there are 
            less than 15 qualified doctors per million people in the country and 
            existing health facilities serve hundreds of thousands of people. 
            Constant insecurity has displaced approximately 2 million Somalis 
            and forced 440,000 to seek refuge in neighboring countries. Attacks 
            on humanitarian workers and health facilities and limited 
            recognition by warring parties of the principle of access for 
            humanitarian organizations to people in need, compounded by a 
            decline in interest from the international donor community and a 
            politicization of aid, have left some of the most vulnerable Somali 
            populations without assistance. In October of 2002, for example, 
            gunmen fired on patients and visitors in an MSF health structure in 
            Aden Yabal in the Middle Shabelle region of the country, killing one 
            and wounding three and resulting in the suspension of aid programs.

            width=250 align=right vspace=5 border=0> <SPAN class=normal>Although 
            peace talks between the government of Sudan and rebel forces 
            controlling much of the southern part of Sudan have promoted "a 
            sustainable peace based on justice, equality, democracy, and 
            freedom," leading to "meaningful development and progress," the 
            people of the western Upper Nile region in southern Sudan have 
            experienced the polar opposite - they have seen perpetual violence 
            and an accompanying deterioration of all life-sustaining systems and 
            infrastructures. In the past few years, a number of factors have 
            forced the displacement of civilian populations. The escalation of 
            violence between the government of Sudan and shifting coalitions of 
            ethnically-based militias have forced residents of the impoverished 
            region to flee their homes, leaving their meager possessions behind 
            to be burned and looted. To make matters worse, the government of 
            Sudan has repeatedly used military aircraft to bomb and strafe 
            civilians living in the path of a road under construction to serve 
            foreign oil companies, forcing thousands to relocate or be killed. 
            Throughout the most recent stage of conflict in southern Sudan, 
            malnutrition and disease have taken over where violence has left 
            off. Forced displacement has led to a vicious cycle of food 
            insecurity and lack of access to health care, as well as an increase 
            in deadly epidemic diseases such as kala azar, malaria, and sleeping 
            sickness.</SPAN></P>

            width=250 align=right vspace=5 border=0> <SPAN class=normal>Ongoing 
            violence and insecurity in Chechnya throughout 2002 continued to 
            threaten the safety of Chechen civilians caught in the conflict and 
            impede the delivery of humanitarian aid to those most in need. On 
            numerous occasions since the spring, authorities in the region have 
            taken measures to pressure displaced Chechens, particularly in the 
            neighboring republic of Ingushetia, to return to Chechnya, where 
            continued fighting and inadequate basic services make living 
            conditions intolerable. In July, the closure of a camp housing some 
            2,200 displaced persons in Znamenskoye, in northern Chechnya, was 
            accomplished through an organized campaign of harassment and 
            coercion that left people with no option but to move out. 
            International organizations active in the region, including MSF, 
            condemned the involuntary return of refugees and displaced persons 
            to Chechnya. Nevertheless, in December, a camp near Aki Yurt in 
            southern Russia was sealed off, and some 1,700 residents were 
            evicted. The authorities have warned that they intend to close all 
            camps for displaced Chechens in the Caucasus by the end of the year 
            2002. An estimated 110,000 persons are currently seeking refuge in 
            camps, private homes, and collective centers in the region. 
            Moreover, assistance provided to those who have returned to Chechnya 
            is largely insufficient, and their safety is not guaranteed. 
            Administrative pressure, kidnappings, and violence in the region 
            have continued to hamper the delivery of much-needed humanitarian 
            aid in the region. In July, Nina Davydovich, the head of Druzhba, a 
            Russian non-governmental organization, was kidnapped, followed by 
            the abduction of Arjan Erkel, head of mission for MSF's projects in 
            Dagestan, on August 12, 2002. Despite repeated calls for their safe 
            release, both have remained in captivity more than four 
            months.</SPAN></P>

            width=250 align=right vspace=5 border=0> <SPAN class=normal>Despite 
            public fanfare over announcements of price reductions of AIDS drugs 
            by the pharmaceutical industry, scientific advances such as the 
            discovery of the mapping of the malaria parasite genome, and the 
            establishment of the largest funding mechanism in history to fight 
            infectious diseases, the vast majority of people suffering from 
            HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis (TB), and other infectious diseases 
            continued to die with no access to lifesaving medicines. The gap 
            between the rhetoric of governments, multilateral agencies, and 
            pharmaceutical companies and the reality faced by millions of people 
            suffering from these treatable diseases has never been as serious as 
            in 2002. Ninety-five percent of the 42 million people with HIV/AIDS 
            live in poor countries and at least 6 million of them require 
            immediate treatment with life-extending anti-retroviral therapy. 
            Although a growing number of programs are proving that such therapy 
            is possible in resource-poor settings, the high cost of medicines 
            and lack of political will to take action, continue to deprive 
            millions of people with AIDS in the developing world of treatment. 
            As a result, six people die from AIDS each minute. Wealthy countries 
            have contributed only a small fraction of the estimated $7-10 
            billion needed annually to fight AIDS alone. The United States' 
            pledge to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, for 
            example, is paltry. In addition, the United States and the European 
            Union have been using trade negotiations to roll back important 
            gains made on access to medicines during the World Trade 
            Organization ministerial meeting in Doha, Qatar, in 2001. Meanwhile, 
            research and development into new treatments for killer infectious 
            diseases such as malaria, TB, kala azar, and sleeping sickness 
            remains woefully inadequate. More people die today from malaria than 
            they did 40 years ago and TB cases are soaring to the point that, if 
            left unchecked, 35 million people will die of the disease over the 
            next decade, according to World Health Organization 
            estimates.</SPAN></P><IMG

            <P><SPAN class=normal>Legal protections shielding civilians from 
            violence during war, as set down in International Humanitarian Law 
            (IHL), have been dangerously undermined during the past year. 
            Terrorist groups like al-Qaeda have shown in word and deed little 
            regard for IHL as they unleash direct attacks on civilians in 
            various countries. In response, the US-led coalition has given 
            worrisome signs that the "war on terror" may require deviating from 
            these fundamental legal guarantees. During the Afghanistan campaign, 
            Pakistan, a close US ally, as well as Iran, faced little protest 
            when they shut their borders to people fleeing the conflict, 
            effectively trapping people in the violence they were trying to 
            escape. Although there is evidence that prisoners of war were 
            suffocated after they had surrendered to the US-supported Northern 
            Alliance, calls for inquiries into the responsibilities for this 
            breach of IHL have been ignored. Devastating aerial bombardments, 
            like the one unleashed on Tora Bora a year ago, have killed an 
            unknown number of civilians in the conflict, but the absence of 
            independent observers has made it difficult, if not impossible, to 
            assess whether all appropriate precautions were taken to limit 
            civilian casualties to a minimum. These actions have had profound 
            global repercussions, especially by legitimizing the idea that there 
            may be exceptions to the application of IHL. Military forces in 
            Colombia, Chechnya, Israel, Pakistan, China, and Liberia, for 
            example, have used the rhetoric of a global "anti-terror" campaign 
            to cover up mounting abuses. Restraints on the conduct of war have 
            been a hard-earned, often threatened, advance in human relations. 
            Western countries, including the US, played a key role in bringing 
            them about particularly in the consolidation of IHL in the Geneva 
            Conventions following World War II. For the millions affected by war 
            around the globe today, it is critical that all countries respect 
            and defend these fundamental rights. </SPAN></P><IMG
