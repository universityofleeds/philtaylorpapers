      March, <I>New York Times </I>columnist Thomas Friedman gushed</B></FONT> 
      that Qatar's wildly popular 24-hour news satellite channel Al-Jazeera [<A 
      href="http://www.al-jazeera.net/">http://www.al-jazeera.net/</A> is "not 
      only the biggest media phenomenon to hit the Arab world since the advent 
      of television, it also is the biggest political phenomenon." Commentators 
      continued to heap praise on the Arabic-language news channel, which has 
      managed to enrage Arab authoritarian regimes with its hard-hitting 
      programming. <BR><BR>But ever since U.S. secretary of state Colin Powell 
      urged Qatar's emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani in early October to 
      rein in what the U.S. administration sees as Al-Jazeera's anti-American 
      bias and inflammatory coverage of the aftermath of the September 11 
      terrorist attacks, the press has adopted a more critical eye. As the 
      United States wages a "war on terror," Al-Jazeera remains the sole foreign 
      broadcaster in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan (and Osama bin Laden's 
      preferred news outlet for transmitting messages). The channel's 
      provocative coverage, which reaches an estimated 35 million viewers, has 
      set off alarm bells in Washington.<BR><BR><IMG align=left height=108 
      hspace=5 src="Briefing%20Al%20Jazeera_files/pull-1.html" vspace=5 
      width=200>Journalists and commentators are now asking whether the station 
      is a balanced news source or a biased outlet for inciting the Arab world 
      against the United States; whether it is an independent news gatherer or a 
      tool in the hands of Bin Laden and his propaganda machine. <BR><BR>To 
      Al-Jazeera's defenders, the station is a reliable, professional, and 
      informative news channel that reflects the perspective of its audience but 
      also tries to present all sides of the story. In a region where the U.S. 
      media are viewed as fundamentally partisan and biased in their own right, 
      the Bush administration's efforts to stifle the channel appear as a 
      hypocritical attempt to smother unwelcome news coverage. <BR><BR><B><FONT 
      color=#003399>A popular channel</FONT><BR></B>There is little question 
      that Al-Jazeera has revolutionized Arabic-language television news in a 
      region that for decades has been accustomed to the stale, heavily censored 
      offerings of state-controlled television. Founded in 1996 with a start-up 
      grant of US$140 million from the Qatari government, Al-Jazeera has quickly 
      become the most watched&#8212;and most controversial&#8212;news channel in the region, 
      winning over viewers with its bold, uncensored news coverage, its 
      unbridled political debates, and its call-in-show formats that tackle a 
      range of sensitive social, political, and cultural issues. 
      <BR><BR>Governments from Algeria to Yemen have lodged complaints against 
      the station at one time or another. Some, like Tunisia and Libya, have 
      temporarily withdrawn their ambassadors from Qatar's capital, Doha, to 
      protest the appearance of political dissidents on talk shows or slights 
      made against their leaders. <BR><BR>A few years ago, Algeria reportedly 
      cut power in part of Algiers to prevent residents from watching a show 
      about the country's brutal civil war. Kuwait temporarily banned the 
      channel's reporters from the country after a caller phoned in and 
      criticized the Emir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah live on the air. 
      Recently, Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority temporarily closed 
      Al-Jazeera's Ramallah bureau because of a promotional trailer for a 
      documentary series about the Lebanese civil war that contained an 
      unflattering image of the Palestinian leader. <BR><B><FONT

      src="Briefing%20Al%20Jazeera_files/Powell_Qatar.html" vspace=5 width=200>On 
      October 3, at a press conference in Washington, D.C., Qatari ruler Sheikh 
      Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani acknowledged that U.S. officials had asked him 
      to use his influence to rein in Al-Jazeera's news coverage. <FONT 
      color=#336699><A 
      href="http://www.cpj.org/news/2001/US04oct01na.html">[Read CPJ's 
      alert]</A></FONT><B><FONT color=#336699></FONT></B> "We heard from the 
      U.S. administration, and also from the previous administration," the emir, 
      referring to both the Bush and Clinton administrations, was quoted as 
      saying. "Naturally we take these things as a kind of advice." Earlier, the 
      U.S. Embassy in Qatar had filed a formal diplomatic complaint with Qatari 
      authorities regarding Al-Jazeera's coverage. Bush administration officials 
      made it clear afterward that they were upset by what they viewed as 
      Al-Jazeera's unbalanced and anti-American coverage. Officials said they 
      feared that Al-Jazeera's replays of its exclusive 1998 interview with 
      Osama bin Laden were stirring up fundamentalist feelings in the region. 
      <BR><BR>U.S. officials were also bothered by airtime given to analysts who 
      expressed anti-American views or attacked U.S. policies in the Middle 
      East. Specifically, the U.S. government was angered when Al-Jazeera 
      broadcast an unconfirmed report that Taliban forces had captured U.S. 
      Special Forces troops inside Afghanistan. Later, U.S. government officials 
      expressed concern that taped messages from Osama bin Laden and his 
      terrorist network, Al-Qaeda, originally aired on Al-Jazeera and 
      rebroadcast by U.S. networks could contain secret codes instructing 
      operatives in the United States to carry out further attacks.<BR><BR>After 
      Secretary Powell's meeting with Emir Hamad, a State Department official 
      told CNN that Powell and the emir "had a frank exchange" on the issue and 
      "there should have been no mistake of where we are coming from." 
      <BR><BR>Said U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher during a 
      daily briefing a few days later: "We would certainly like to see them tone 
      down the rhetoric."<BR><FONT color=#003399><BR><B>A biased, anti-American 
      channel?</B></FONT><BR>During the administration's offensive against 
      Al-Jazeera, U.S. media have put the channel under the microscope. Although 
      the Qatari government subsidizes Al-Jazeera, the station has been 
      generally well regarded for its editorial independence. Nevertheless, it 
      has been taken to task for usually avoiding tough scrutiny of Qatari 
      affairs and any strong criticism of the ruling al-Thani family. Arab 
      critics have accused the channel's free-for-all debate shows of being 
      sensational and at times unprofessional.<BR><BR>Deeper questions have been 
      asked about Al-Jazeera's alleged anti-American editorial bias, the 
      supposed pro-Taliban leanings of its Kabul correspondent Tayseer Allouni, 
      and its apparent failure to air footage that shows the Taliban in a 
      negative light. Critics have accused the channel of acting as a mouthpiece 
      for Osama bin Laden by broadcasting his taped messages. Western media have 
      even questioned whether Allouni had held on to Bin Laden's first 
      videotaped message after the September 11 attacks until after U.S. bombing 
      of Afghanistan began&#8212;something Al-Jazeera and Allouni have 
      denied.<BR><BR>A <I>New York Times</I> editorial recently criticized 
      Al-Jazeera for reporting that Jews had been informed in advance of 
      September 11 not to go to work at the World Trade Center. (An official at 
      the station told CPJ that a talk show host cited the charge, which had 
      previously appeared in a Jordanian newspaper, and asked his guests what 
      they thought about the report.) More recently, the channel has been 
      criticized for using the term "martyr" in newscasts to describe 
      Palestinian suicide bombers who have killed Israeli civilians. But 
      Al-Jazeera contends that they use the term for all Palestinians who die 
      fighting a "cause," not just suicide bombers.<BR><BR><IMG align=left 
      height=250 hspace=5 src="Briefing%20Al%20Jazeera_files/Al-Jazeera.html" 
      vspace=5 width=300>With tensions already high in the Middle East and 
      anti-American sentiment growing, some say such programming only worsens 
      the atmosphere. "This isn't playing with fire, this is using a 
      flamethrower in terms of the potential impact on the governments in the 
      Islamic world," James Morris of the Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies 
      at the University of Exeter in Britain was quoted as saying recently in 
      the <I>Christian Science Monitor</I>. "This is Osama bin Laden's 
      loudspeaker." <BR><B><BR></B>The criticism has angered Al-Jazeera staff, 
      who have roundly rejected most of the accusations and maintain that their 
      reporting is objective and includes all points of view. "Osama Bin Laden, 
      like it or not, is a party to this present crisis," news editor Ahmed 
      Sheikh told the BBC. "If we said that we were not going to allow him the 
      air time, then we would have lost our integrity and objectivity and our 
      coverage of the story would have become unbalanced." <BR><BR>While 
      analysts who have appeared on its talk shows or news programs have harshly 
      criticized U.S. policy, Al-Jazeera maintains that other opinions have been 
      presented and that the views of U.S. officials, as well as State 
      Department briefings, have been duly aired since September 11. According 
      to the channel, some Arab viewers even accuse it of promoting U.S. 
      propaganda when it airs U.S. officials or statements. 
      <B><BR></B><BR>Nevertheless, some at Al-Jazeera are self-critical. "I 
      think since September 11...or even before&#8212;that some people would put [on 
      the air] what could be called inflammatory rhetoric or people with 
      outrageous views," a source at Al-Jazeera told CPJ. "After the crisis and 
      the complaints I think [the coverage] has toned down....The message was 
      heard and Al-Jazeera adjusted." But the same source argued that any bias 
      at Al-Jazeera did not stem from ill intent but simply reflected the 
      reporters' backgrounds and points of view.<BR><FONT 
      color=#003399><BR><B><IMG align=right height=270 hspace=5 
      src="Briefing%20Al%20Jazeera_files/J-image.html" vspace=5 width=300>A new war, 
      an old double standard</B></FONT><B><BR></B>Journalists and others in the 
      Arab world see the United States, which touts itself as a symbol of 
      freedom and democracy, as hypocritical for pressuring Al-Jazeera to modify 
      its coverage.<B> </B>"The work of Al-Jazeera has been professional and 
      balanced," says Daoud Kuttab, director of the Institute of Modern Media at 
      Al-Quds University in the West Bank and an observer of Arab regional 
      media. "As to the Americans, they are completely wrong and apply a double 
      standard. I can see why they are angry but it is not because Al-Jazeera is 
      not fair. On the contrary, I think they wish for Al-Jazeera to be biased 
      to the U.S." <BR><BR>Moreover, many viewers from the region view Western 
      media coverage as extremely partisan, especially where the Middle East is 
      concerned. "The lies, falsehood, and enmity with respect to Arabs and 
      Muslims in the U.S. media, particularly CNN, play an extremely bad role in 
      kindling feelings of revenge," a columnist at Jordan's semi-official daily 
      <I>Al-Dustur</I> argued recently. <BR><BR>"What about the U.S. right-wing 
      press that's been [bashing] Arabs?" asks former CNN correspondent Peter 
      Arnett, who himself was a target of U.S. criticism for his coverage from 
      Baghdad during the Gulf War. "Do they rein them in? Do they rein in Fox 
      TV? Are we going to order our own media to rein in its coverage? It's 
      getting out of hand."<BR><B><BR></B>Aside from the press freedom 
      implications, U.S. calls for Qatar to censor Al-Jazeera may have backfired 
      by sparking criticism from the Arab world at a time when the United States 
      needs the support of people in the region. "I think this elevates 
      Al-Jazeera into an even more powerful organization than it is," says 
      Arnett. "Simply it's a news source that's threatening the U.S....They 
      don't have any guns. They haven't been traced to Bin Laden." <BR><FONT

      width=200>Getting the point across</FONT></B></FONT><B><BR></B>Critics of 
      the administration's policy have advised the United States to respond to 
      Al-Jazeera in the same way it would respond to critics at home&#8212;by getting 
      out its own message instead of trying to censor the channel. In fact, 
      Al-Jazeera has complained that U.S. officials have been unavailable to 
      present their side of the story to viewers. Hafez al-Mirazi, Al-Jazeera's 
      Washington bureau chief, points out that while he secured an interview 
      with Colin Powell shortly after the September 11 attacks, U.S. officials 
      did not show a keen interest afterward in making further 
      appearances.<BR><BR>But the administration appears to have grasped the 
      channel's importance as a medium to reach millions in the Arab world. The 
      State Department has now assigned at least one official per day to speak 
      with the channel, according to al-Mirazi. He has already interviewed 
      Assistant Secretary of State for the Near East William Burns, National 
      Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. 
      President Bush is said to be considering an appearance of his own. In 
      addition, U.S. government is considering taking out paid advertisements on 
      the channel.<BR><B><BR></B>By putting administration officials on the air, 
      the United States hopes to exploit Al-Jazeera's reach in the Arab world 
      and make its case to the public in a region where anti-American sentiment 
      runs strong. As Al-Jazeera continues to cover the war in Afghanistan&#8212;and 
      its effects on civilians&#8212;such a policy may become more essential. 
      <BR><BR>Meanwhile, Al-Jazeera staff stand behind their coverage. An anchor 
      at Al-Jazeera argued that his channel is not biased. "Every press 
      conference of every U.S. leader or the Pentagon or the State Department is 
      aired directly live on the channel," he said. "We try to have lots of 
      viewpoints."<BR><B><FONT color=#003399><BR></FONT></B>
