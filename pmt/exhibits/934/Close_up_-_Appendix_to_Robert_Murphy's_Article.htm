<H4>Part 3: Appendix : British War Films 1950 - 1960</H4>
<P>This list has been compiled from Kinematograph Weekly end of year reports and 
is intend as a guide rather than a definitive account. <A 
href="http://www.shu.ac.uk/services/lc/closeup/fiftiesa.htm#note17">(17)</A> 
</P>
<H4>1950</H4>
<P><B>The Wooden Horse</B> and<B> Odette</B> were the 4th and 6th most popular 
films at the box office. <B>They Were Not Divided</B> (d. Terence Young. &#8216;An 
attempt to do for the Guards what <B>The Way To The Stars</B> did for the RAF&#8217;. 
Monthly Film Bulletin) was included in the list of 30 most popular films. <B>The 
Miniver Story</B> was mentioned for Greer Garson's performance. The only other 
British war film released this year was (according to the MFB) 'a uniquely 
incompetent' Resistance movie, directed by Edmond T. Greville, <B>But Not in 
Vain</B>. Two classic American war pictures were released in 1950 <B>Sands of 
Iwo Jima</B> (included in the top 30) and <B>Twelve 0 Clock High</B> (noted for 
Gregory Peck's performance). </P>
<H4>1951</H4>
<P>Two war comedies <B>-Worm&#8217;s Eye View</B> and <B>Appointment With Venus</B> - 
got into the top 30 as did two big American films <B>Rommel: Desert Fox</B> and 
<B>The Halls of Montezuma</B> but no serious British war films were released 
that year except for the war thriller <B>Circle of Danger</B> (d. Jacques 
Tourneur).</P>
<H4>1952</H4>
<P>ABPC's Battle of Britain film <B>Angels One Five</B> was very successful at 
the box office, Philip Leacock&#8217;s sombre bomber film <B>Appointment in 
London</B>, much less so, despite the presence of Dirk Bogarde. The long run of 
service comedies started with Brian Rix's popular farce<B> Reluctant Heroes</B> 
and Launder and Gilliatt's disappointingly flat <B>Folly to be Wise.</B> Several 
serious war films were being made for release in I953.</P>
<H4>1953</H4>
<P><B>The Cruel Sea</B> was the 3rd most popular film at the box office and 
three other British war films were included in the top 30: <B>The Malta 
Story</B> (d. Brian Desmond Hurst),<B> Albert RN</B> and <B>The Red Beret</B> 
(d. Terence Young) along with the American films <B>Stalag I7</B> and <B>The 
Desert Rats.</B> Two service comedies, Ken Annakin&#8217;s Technicolor <B>You Know 
What Sailors Are</B> and Mancunian&#8217;s low-budget <B>Its a Grand Life</B> (with 
Frank Randle and Diana Dors) and Lewis Milestone&#8217;s <B>They Who Dare</B> (again 
Technicolor) are not mentioned as having done well.</P>
<H4>1954</H4>
<P>Very few war films released this year: only <B>The Purple Plain</B> starring 
Gregory Peck, is included in the top 30, along with Columbia&#8217;s <B>Pearl 
Harbour</B> classic <B>From Here To Eternity</B>. But several war films were in 
production.</P>
<H4>1955</H4>
<P>A big year for war films with <B>The Dam Busters</B>, the top box office 
grosser and <B>Above Us The Waves</B> (d. Ralph Thomas), <B>The Colditz 
Story</B> and <B>The Sea Shall Not Have Them</B> (d. Lewis Gilbert) included in 
the top 30. The only other British film was a re-make of a 30s barrack room 
comedy<B> Orders Are Orders</B> (d. David Palthengi), which, despite the 
presence of Peter Sellers, Sid James, Tony Hancock, Raymond Huntley and Bill 
Fraser doesn&#8217;t seem to have made much of a mark.</P>
<H4>1956</H4>
<P>Another good year for war films with<B> Reach For the Sky</B> the top film, 
<B>Private&#8217;s Progress</B> 3rd and <B>Cockleshell Heroes</B>,<B> A Town Like 
Alice</B> (d. Jack Lee), <B>The Baby and the Battleship, </B><B>Sailor Beware 
(d. Gordon Parry)</B> and <B>The Man Who Never Was</B> (d. Ronald Neame) among 
the top 20 films.</P>
<H4>1957</H4>
<P><B>The Battle of The River Plate</B> was the third most popular film and 
another film from Powell and Pressburger:<B> Ill Met by Moonlight </B>was in the 
top 30 along with <B>The One That Got Away</B> (d. Roy Baker) and <B>Yangste 
Incident.</B> Other war films, Columbia&#8217;s British offering <B>High Flight</B> 
(d. John Gilling), British Lion&#8217;s <B>A Hill in Korea</B> (d. Julian Amyes) and 
Hammer's <B>The Steel Bayonet</B> (d. Michael Carreras) don't seem to have done 
particularly well.</P>
<H4>1958</H4>
<P>The peak year for war films with <B>The Bridge on the River Kwai</B> and 
<B>Dunkirk</B> first and third most popular films (with <B>The Vikings</B> 
sandwiched between them), and included among the top 30 at the box office:<B> 
The Battle of the V1</B> (d. Vernon Sewell), <B>Camp on Blood Island</B>, 
<B>Carry on Sergeant, Carve Her Name With Pride</B> (d. Lewis Gilbert) <B>Ice 
Cold in Alex</B> (d. Lee Thompson), <B>The Key </B>(d. Carol Reed), as well as 
four Hollywood war films - <B>The Naked and the Dead,</B> <B>No Time for 
Sergeants, A Time to Love and a Time to Die</B> and <B>The Young Lions</B> . 
Cubby Broccoli&#8217;s<B> No Time to Die</B> (d. Terence Young) along with two films 
which were critically acclaimed - <B>I Was Monty&#8217;s Double</B> (d. John 
Guillermin) and Asquith's grimly sardonic<B> Orders to Kill </B>- did less well 
at the box office.</P>
<H4>1959</H4>
<P><B>Danger Within</B>, a Bryan Forbes scripted POW camp escape movie did 
moderately well and Hammer's hard-hitting<B> Yesterday&#8217;s Enemy</B> more so but 
the only war films to get in to the top 30 were the Fox-British Ingrid Bergman 
vehicle <B>The Inn of the Sixth Happiness</B> and the ABPC service comedy 
<B>Operation Bullshine.</B></P>
<H4>1960</H4>
<P><B>Sink The Bismark</B> was second only to <B>Doctor in Love</B> at the box 
office (with <B>Carry On Constable</B> third). Two less prestigious war films<B> 
Light Up the Sky</B> (a rare home front film with Ian Carmichael, Tommy Steel, 
Benny Hill, Sydney Tafler and Dick Emery as a searchlight battery crew, directed 
by Lewis Gilbert), and <B>Foxhole in Cairo</B> (d. John Moxey) did well enough 
to get in to the top 30. Other war films, notably <B>The Long, the Short and the 
Tall</B> and Carl Foreman's long-awaited epic <B>The Guns of Navarone</B> (d. 
Lee Thompson) were being lined up for release in I961.</P>
