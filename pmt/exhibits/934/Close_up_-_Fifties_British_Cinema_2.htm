<H4>Part 2</H4>
<P>One experience which all classes did share in the 50s was National Service. 
Conscription was introduced by the Labour government in 1949 and abolished by 
the Tories in 1960, to the relief of all concerned. Its unpopularity made it an 
ideal butt for film comedy and was early exploited by Brian Rix in <B>Reluctant 
Heroes</B> (d. Jack Raymond, 1952) and Frank Randle in <B>Its a Grand Life</B> 
(d. John Blakeley, 1953). Service comedies remained a staple of the 50s film 
industry - <B>Privates Progress</B> (d. John Boulting, 1956), <B>Carry On 
Sergeant</B> (d. Gerald Thomas, 1958) and <B>Operation Bullshine</B> (d. Gilbert 
Gunn, 1959) were hugely successful - and at the end of the decade the 
Kinematograph Weekly was still expressing satisfaction that service comedies are 
'as safe as the Bank of England'.</P>
<P>What strikes one about 50s war films is not the success of a particular cycle 
of films - POW camp films, stiff-upper-lip naval dramas, heroic flyer films, 
resistance movies, service comedies, commando-raid action pics - but the success 
of a wide spectrum of different types of war films and the very low rate of 
failure. Despite the competition of over 300 American films a year, a remarkable 
number of British war films were included in the top box-office films each year, 
and few were expensive flops. The public's taste ranged from the restraint of<B> 
Angels One Five</B> (d. George More O&#8217;Ferrall, 1952) to the technicolor 
splendour of <B>The Bridge On the River Kwai;</B> from the romantic daredevilry 
of<B> Reach for the Sky</B> to the grimly uncompromising <B>The Cruel Sea</B>; 
from the visceral sensationalism of Hammer's <B>Camp on Blood Island</B> (d. Val 
Guest, 1958) to the gentlemanly heroics of <B>The Battle of the River Plate</B> 
(d. Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, 1956); from unwieldy epics like<B> 
Dunkirk</B> (d. Leslie Norman, 1958) to slick Anglo-American co-productions like 
<B>Cockleshell Heroes</B> (d. Joe Ferrer, 1955). 
<P>Various reasons have been advanced for the popularity of war films in the 
50s. Lindsay Anderson considers that: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>with Britain&#8217;s position as a world power becoming less and less 
  assured and her traditional political values beginning to be questioned (as 
  evidenced by the break-up of the Empire and the mishandling of the Suez 
  affair), there was an apparent instinctive desire on the part of the public to 
  have its national confidence and pride bolstered by some substitute means. 
  Hence the nostalgic harking back to a time in the recent past when issues were 
  clear-cut and Britain&#8217;s greatness though under threat was self evident and 
  confirmed by victory. <A 
  href="http://www.shu.ac.uk/services/lc/closeup/fiftiesa.htm#note7">(7)</A> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Roy Armes comes to similar conclusions. For him 50s war films &#8216;offer evidence 
of a reaction against contemporary social changes, a nostalgia for the fixed 
hierarchical society of the armed services and the firm, unquestioned virtues 
(fortitude loyalty courage) of the war period.&#8217; And he dismisses them as 
&#8216;archaic memories of a self-deluding era&#8217;s retreat into a cosy never-never 
land.&#8217; <A 
href="http://www.shu.ac.uk/services/lc/closeup/fiftiesa.htm#note8">(8)</A> 
Raymond Durgnat puts in a plea for stiff upper-lip naval films like <B>The Cruel 
Sea, Yangste Incident</B> (d. Herbert Wilcox, 1957), <B>Sink the Bismark</B> (d. 
Lewis Gilbert, 1960) and <B>The Battle of the River Plate</B>, praising their 
&#8216;emphatic abandonment of simpler, gallanter notions about war and fair play for 
something more humiliated and realistic.&#8217; But he goes along with the idea that 
war films served as a substitute for the real thing:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The ignominies of pre-war appeasement seemed to carry an obvious 
  moral with respect to Stalin. But the prospect of World War III was so 
  unappetizing that anxieties could agreeably be fed back into movies about 
  World War II which was undoubtedly justified, and over, and won <A 
  href="http://www.shu.ac.uk/services/lc/closeup/fiftiesa.htm#note9">(9)</A>. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Armes and Anderson, trying to rescue British cinema from the stiff upper lip 
realist tradition, have little sympathy for films like The Dam Busters (d. 
Michael Anderson, 1955) and The Cruel Sea. Critics writing long after that 
tradition had expired could afford to be more dispassionate. Nicholas Pronay, 
for example, sees fifties war films as usefully cathartic:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>They did their job in the scheme of things, the job which fiction 
  film in particular could be expected to do for the people of the culture of 
  which it formed a part. They allowed the people in the audience to re-live 
  vicariously their experiences, the fears, guilt and dilemmas of their own 
  particular war; and to catharsise psychological sores still festering. <A 
  href="http://www.shu.ac.uk/services/lc/closeup/fiftiesa.htm#note10">(10)</A> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Second World War, like most wars, was fought by very young men ( the 
average age of Battle of Britain pilots was twenty-one) and for those who 
survived it was likely to be the most traumatic and dramatic period of their 
lives. War films allowed an opportunity of re-living and coming to terms with 
that experience. And for the generation who grew up surrounded by 
bombed-building sites and tales of the war, these films allowed a glimpse into 
that fascinating world which they had been too young to experience directly. 
</P>
<P>The fifties was a period of prosperity and full employment. Wage levels rose 
faster than prices and the 1944 Education Act opened up educational 
opportunities and encouraged a degree of social mobility. But if most people had 
&#8216;never had it so good&#8217; they didn&#8217;t take prosperity for granted. Respectability, 
deference, caution, consensus marked the fifties, but beneath the tranquil 
surface lurked the dreadful, exciting events of the war. Films provided an 
opportunity to safely return to those events - though for men much more so than 
for women. And as a generation gap opened up between parents and children, war 
films were one of the few things that fathers could enthusiastically share with 
their sons.</P>
<P>There is another reason for the popularity of British war films in the 
fifties. They were something the British film industry did well. Unlike musicals 
or Westerns or gangster films, war films didn&#8217;t seem to be the exclusive 
preserve of Hollywood. Britain&#8217;s role in winning the Second World War, though 
less important than was believed at the time, was significant enough to fuel a 
body of often exciting and sometimes serious films. Like the horror films that 
began to emerge from Hammer studios after 1957, fifties war films constituted a 
genre.</P>
<P>Films made between 1939 and 1945 are of a bewildering variety: home front 
melodramas as different as <B>Millions Like Us</B> and <B>A Canterbury Tale</B>; 
divergent attempts to capture the reality of war in films such as<B> In Which We 
Serve</B> and <B>Desert Victory</B>. They share common themes, promote similar 
ideological messages, but except in their striving towards reality, they have 
little in common stylistically. Films made in response to an ongoing situation 
don&#8217;t have time to build conventions. Fifties war films are less formula-bound 
than one might suppose, but they share codes, actors, visual style and they can 
be corralled into coherent groups. By looking at three films - <B>The Cruel Sea, 
The Dam Busters</B> and <B>Reach for the Sky</B> - in more detail it may be 
possible to draw some tentative conclusions. 
<P><B>The Cruel Sea, </B>directed by Charles Frend who had made another popular 
naval drama -<B> San Demetrio-London</B> - in the midst of the war, was 
extremely successful with both the critics and the public. In contrast to the 
carefully balanced class divisions of <B>In Which We Serve</B> and the cheerful 
everybody pitching in together feel of <B>San Demetrio-London</B>, The Cruel 
Seal is unrelentingly middle class. The one officer who is not a gentleman, 
used-car salesman Stanley Baker, is quickly moved on, and the crew are 
reverently deferential to their business-like captain Jack Hawkins. There is one 
dangerous moment when the placidity of Hawkins&#8217; order is threatened. After 
making the difficult decision whether or not to blow to smithereens a group of 
ship-wrecked British sailors along with the U-boat lying directly underneath 
them, somebody mutinously shouts out &#8216;Murderer&#8217; at the unhappy Hawkins. We are 
not expected to agree: the Captain's actions are carefully framed within a 'war 
is hell' context and we are hardly allowed to empathise with those rather 
comical figures optimistically bobbing up and down on the waves before being so 
ignominiously scuppered. It is Hawkins, the hard man with the heart of gold, 
whom we sympathise with as he gets impressively drunk to drown the pain.</P>
<P>In <B>The Dam Busters</B>, the horrors of war are glanced at and then 
cleverly side-stepped. Despite its quirky realism and its clever structure 
(Durgnat talks of &#8216;its bold, original architecture of disappointment and loss&#8217;), 
<B>The Dam Busters</B> gives a misleading picture of the role of British bombers 
in the war. The raid on the dams was successful, though the breaches were soon 
repaired, but the casualty rate was unacceptably high. Ten of the nineteen 
planes were lost, fifty-six of the hundred and thirty-three men and the 
squadron&#8217;s consequent reputation as a &#8216;suicide squadron&#8217; made recruitment 
difficult. More important, this sort of strategic bombing was considered futile 
by Air Commander &#8216;Bomber&#8217; Harris. Barnes-Wallace's bouncing bomb was visually 
spectacular but his ten ton &#8216;Grand Slam&#8217; was considered more useful by Bomber 
Command. While the USAF developed long-range fighters to accompany its bombers 
on daylight precision bombing raids, the RAF concentrated its efforts on the 
night bombing of civilian targets with dubiously impressive results: I35,000 
died in the Dresden fire storm. Even within the film though, pathos for the 
victims of war is displaced. Our sympathies are evoked not for the 749 Russian 
prisoners of war drowned when the Mohne dam was smashed, nor even the fifty-six 
men lost on the raid, but for the victim of a traffic accident: Guy Gibson's 
beer-swilling dog 'Nigger' <A 
href="http://www.shu.ac.uk/services/lc/closeup/fiftiesa.htm#note11">(11)</A>. 
</P>
<P><B>Reach for the Sky </B>is similarly distortive. Closely following Paul 
Brickhill's biography, the films long first half is devoted to Douglas Bader's 
exploits in the early 30s. Despite the loss of both legs he manages to engineer 
his return to the RAF at the outbreak of war and rapidly rises to become a 
squadron leader. Having established Bader's reckless courage and dogged 
determination the film proceeds to unquestioningly endorse his romantic attitude 
towards the war. The Battle of Britain was won by Air Chief Marshall Hugh 
Dowding's coldly realistic strategy of sending small groups of radio controlled 
fighters to make accurate hit and run attacks on the huge fleets of bombers sent 
over by the Luftwaffe. Dowding was well aware that in one to one combat between 
fighters the more experienced German pilots were likely to come off best. As Len 
Deighton points out: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>For years pilots had been coming from the training schools at the 
  rate of 800 per month and a high proportion of German crews had flown under 
  combat conditions in Spain, Poland and France. Their tactics were tried and 
  tested and their flying skills incomparably better than those of the RAF 
  squadrons. <A 
  href="http://www.shu.ac.uk/services/lc/closeup/fiftiesa.htm#note12">(12)</A> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Dowding was convinced that Britain would lose a war of attrition in which 
each side merely sought to shoot down the maximum number of enemy aircraft. He 
continually discouraged futile heroics and stressed that the main aim was to 
break up the German attacks and prevent the bombers from inflicting decisive 
damage on their targets. Bader, endorsed by his ambitious section controller 
Leigh-Mallory, advocated &#8216;big wings&#8217; of five or more squadrons which would fight 
pitched battles with the Germans and act on their own initiative rather than 
under orders from ground control. It was a view more in tune with the myth of 
&#8216;knights of the air&#8217; fighting chivalric individual combats than the reality of 
swooping down on the enemy from a superior height and shooting him in the back. 
Once the Battle of Britain was won, the political appeal of this myth made it 
expedient to sack Dowding - who had allowed German fighters to range across 
Southern England unchallenged and to promote Leigh-Mallory and make Bader into a 
national hero. </P>
<P>Neil Rattigan asserts that fifties war films were a &#8216;reflection of the last 
ditch effort by the dominant class to maintain its hegemony by re-writing the 
history of the celluloid war in its own favour.&#8217; <A 
href="http://www.shu.ac.uk/services/lc/closeup/fiftiesa.htm#note13">(13)</A> The 
RAF was much less rigidly class-bound than the Army and Navy - of the 3,000 
Fighter Command crew who fought in the Battle of Britain only 200 were public 
school educated. But in the films working class characters appear to exist only 
to polish shoes and start engines and in<B> Reach for the Sky</B> the waitress 
who captures Bader&#8217;s heart turns out to be a wing commander&#8217;s daughter in mufti. 
If 50s war films are skewed towards the middle class, how does one explain their 
wide appeal to working class audiences? The answer must lie mainly - as 
Christine Geraghty points out - in their celebrations and explorations of 
masculinity. &#8216;By taking on narratives which concentrate on men at war, the films 
almost inevitably negotiate questions of courage, fear and the desire to 
survive.' <A 
href="http://www.shu.ac.uk/services/lc/closeup/fiftiesa.htm#note14">(14)</A> In 
doing so, issues around class tend to be submerged. The emphasis on active 
service, the absence of home life, the use of actors like Jack Hawkins and 
Kenneth More, whose gritty or breezy professionalism is much less class specific 
than the clipped suavity of Clive Brook or Noel Coward, steer the films away 
from the dangerous waters of class. Thus More&#8217;s Bader gains the respect of his 
squadron not by patronising chat or innate class superiority but by a display of 
dare-devil acrobatics and a brash dismissal of the bureaucrats who get in the 
way of &#8216;the real business of killing Huns'.</P>
<P>50s British war films were not made by an industry so desperately in decline 
that it needed to play safe. Very few of the films are merely formulaic. The POW 
camp dramas <B>The Wooden Horse</B>, <B>The Colditz Story, Albert RN</B> and<B> 
Danger Within</B> are directly comparable, but they each have marked 
peculiarities and the service comedies range from sentimental situation comedy - 
(T<B>he Baby and the Battleship</B>, d. Jay Lewis, 1956) to knockabout farce 
(<B>Its a Grand Life</B> and <B>Reluctant Heroes</B>), from satire (<B>Privates 
Progress</B>) to vulgar humour (<B>Carry on Sergeant</B>). 
<P>The popularity of British as against American war films in the 1950s 
indicates that it was the myths around Britain&#8217;s achievement in the Second World 
rather than a celebration of war as such which attracted audiences. The 
concentration on the contribution of officers rather than men is very noticeable 
in most serious British war films in the 50s but changes in society made a 
return to the populism of the 40s impossible. A handful of films can be accused 
of romanticising or glamorising war, but the predominant tone is one of subdued 
realism - the much despised stiff-upper-lip being often used as a convenient 
short-hand for necessarily suppressed pain, bitterness and fear. As Christine 
Geraghty explains: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the films made during the war, fear is a natural emotion which 
  can be overcome with the help of the group. In the 50s war films, fear is a 
  personal weakness which should not be admitted to. Fear is thus repressed but 
  erupts dramatically when a man breaks down. The isolation of the masculine 
  world of war can be understood in this context as an attempt to maintain an 
  invulnerability which is necessary for heroism. <A 
  href="http://www.shu.ac.uk/services/lc/closeup/fiftiesa.htm#note15">(15)</A> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Films with a sourer and more cynical attitude to the war began to emerge at 
the end of the decade. Anthony Asquith&#8217;s <B>Orders to Kill</B> (1958), Val 
Guest&#8217;s <B>Yesterday&#8217;s Enemy</B> (1959) and Jack Lee&#8217;s <B>Circle of 
Deception</B> (1960), for example <A 
href="http://www.shu.ac.uk/services/lc/closeup/fiftiesa.htm#note16">(16)</A>. 
They became increasingly prevalent in the 60s -<B> The Long, the Short and the 
Tall </B>(d. Leslie Norman, 1961), <B>Reach for Glory</B> (d. Philip Leacock, 
1962) <B>The Victors</B> (d. Carl Foreman, 1963), <B>The Hill </B>(d. Sidney 
Lumet, 1965),<B> How I Won the War</B> (d. Richard Lester, 1967), <B>The Long 
Day&#8217;s Dying</B> (d. Peter Collinson, 1967) - but they failed to achieve the 
commercial success of epics and action pictures such as <B>The Guns of 
Navarone</B> (d. Lee Thompson, 1961), <B>The Great Escape</B> (d. John Sturges, 
1963), <B>The Heroes of Telemark</B> (d. Anthony Mann and Gil Woxholt, 1965), 
and <B>Where Eagle&#8217;s Dare </B>(Brian G. Hutton and Yakima Canutt, 1968). These 
were international rather than specifically British films and that intimate 
involvement - less nostalgia perhaps than a necessary re-emersion - in the 
specifically British experience of the Second World War seemed to have run its 
course in the cinema. But at the end of the 70s came a revival, with films such 
as<B> Yanks</B> (d. John Schlesinger, 1979), <B>The Dresser </B>(d. Peter Yates, 
1984), <B>Hope and Glory</B> (d. John Boorman, 1987) and <B>Memphis Belle</B> 
(d. Michael Caton Jones, 1991), and a fascinating trilogy of television plays - 
<B>Licking Hitler </B>(d. David Hare, 1978), <B>The Imitation Game</B> (d. 
Richard Eyre, 1980) and <B>Rainy Day Women</B> (d. Ben Bolt, 1983). Television 
series dealing with or set during the Second World War continue to proliferate, 
indicating that its place in the British collective psyche is perhaps as 
significant and as durable as that of the Wild West for Americans</P>
