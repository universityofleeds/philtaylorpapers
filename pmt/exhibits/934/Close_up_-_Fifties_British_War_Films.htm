<H4>Part 1</H4>
<P>When any thought at all is given to the British film industry in the 50s then 
the tendency is to categorise it as a dull period between the gritty realism of 
the war years and the American backed 'Swinging London' films of the 60s. Ealing 
declined, the documentary movement disappeared and cinemas closed in their 
thousands as audiences turned away from the predominant fare of nostalgic war 
films and inane comedies to their television sets. Looked at more closely, this 
dismal picture of decline dissolves to reveal British cinema as surprisingly 
robust, fertile and adaptable. </P>
<P>Box-office admissions which had peaked at 1,635 million in 1946 had fallen to 
1,396 million by 1950. This was still well above the pre-war figure (990 
million) and could be seen as an inevitable adjustment to the ending of 
exceptional war-time conditions, but by 1960 the figure had fallen to 515 
million and the number of cinemas fell from 4,583 in 1950 to 3,414 in 1959 <A 
href="http://www.shu.ac.uk/services/lc/closeup/fiftiesa.htm#note1">(1)</A>. 
However the blow was softened by the public's willingness to pay more for their 
cinema visits and the government's willingness to cut entertainment tax. Until 
the mid 50s rises in seat prices compensated for the decline in attendance and 
though box-office receipts fell by 41 per cent between 1954 and 1960 cuts in 
entertainment tax meant that the net received by exhibitors fell by only 15 per 
cent <A 
href="http://www.shu.ac.uk/services/lc/closeup/fiftiesa.htm#note2">(2)</A>. </P>
<P>Decline appeared to strengthen the position of the two major British 
companies Rank and ABPC.</P>

<P>Rank had lurched into draconian rationalization in 1958 with the merger of 
its Odeon and Gaumont circuits and dealt a bitter blow to independent 
distributors like British Lion which had hitherto had little difficulty getting 
their films released on one of the circuits. But the problem of getting a 
circuit release for independent product was not to become a serious problem 
until the 60s.</P>
<P>The 40s had been a golden age in terms of cinema admissions and the 
production of memorable British films but war-time restrictions and fierce 
American competition severely limited the number of films made - an average of 
52 first features a year, with production reaching a peak of 66 in 1949 <A 
href="http://www.shu.ac.uk/services/lc/closeup/fiftiesa.htm#note3">(3)</A>. The 
decade ended with the collapse of the Rank Organisation's attempt to change this 
pattern by carving out a share of the American market and using its power as a 
major exhibitor to restrict the number of Hollywood films shown in Britain. 
Massive losses led to the closure of Highbury, Shepherds Bush (sold to the BBC), 
Islington and Denham studios in 1949, and Rank's severely curtailed production 
activities were concentrated at Pinewood.</P>
<P>Though the 50s began gloomily a shortage of product caused by the contraction 
of the American film industry, pressure on resources in terms of studios and 
personnel from television, and an ability to make films genuinely popular at the 
box-office kept British film production relatively buoyant throughout the 
decade.</P>

<P>Television quickly became had become a :major force in America but in Britain 
its impact was much more gradual. In 1950 only 382,300 television licences had 
been issued. The Coronation of 1953 made people aware of television's potential 
but, though licences were up to two and a half million, this was as yet too 
small a number to bite into the cinemas audience and the Kinematograph Weekly 
gloated that, &#8216;the BBC recording furnished the finest and most widely 
distributed trailer in the annals of show business&#8217; helping to make the Rank 
film <B>A Queen is Crowned</B> the box-office success of the year <A 
href="http://www.shu.ac.uk/services/lc/closeup/fiftiesa.htm#note4">(4)</A>. </P>
<P>After 1955 when the BBC&#8217;s monopoly ended and commercial television was 
launched, television did begin to make serious inroads into the cinemas 
audience. But its effects on the film industry were by no means uniformly 
harmful. It provided new opportunities for film industry personnel - like cinema 
exhibitor Sidney Bernstein who won the huge Northern franchise for Granada, and 
the Woolf brothers, highly successful independent film producers, who set up 
Anglia. Many of the smaller studios - Brighton, Rusholme, Teddington, Bushey - 
discovered a new lease of life as television studios, and the BBC expanded from 
Shepherds Bush to Ealing, As early as 1952 the old British National Studios at 
Elstree were being used to produce American TV series and by 1957 all studios 
except Pinewood and Shepperton were sharing their facilities between television 
and feature film production.</P>
<P>Hollywood had to adapt earlier and more rapidly to television and with the 
studio system crumbling, American companies put an increasing proportion of 
their resources into overseas production, Fox took over Denham for a while and 
MGM had its own large modern studios at Boreham Wood. Warner Brothers, with 
almost a half share in ABPC occasionally made use of their Elstree studio. 
Columbia not only produced its own films in Britain but entered into 
co-production deals with independent production companies such as Romulus (the 
Woolf brothers), Warwick (Cubby Broccoli) and Anglo-Amalgamated (Nat Cohen). The 
resulting Anglo-American films - Siodmak's The <B>Crimson Pirate</B>, Houston's 
<B>The African Queen</B>, <B>Moby Dick</B> and <B>Moulin Rouge</B>, Mark 
Robson's <B>The Inn of the Sixth Happiness</B>, Jose Ferrer's <B>Cockleshell 
Heroes</B> - proved remarkably successful and for most of the 50s around a third 
of the films produced in Britain had some American involvement. Nonetheless, 
British producers were quite capable of making it on their own. In two fields 
they were outstandingly successful: comedy and war films </P>
<P>George Formby and Gracie Fields had been Britain's two major box-office stars 
of the 30s and Britain had a tradition of popular film comedy into which films 
like the Norman Wisdom cycle easily slotted. Betty Box&#8217;s <B>Doctor in the 
House</B> and its sequels, starring Dirk Bogarde as the shy, handsome, young 
hero, and Anglo-Amalgamated&#8217;s <U>Carry-On</U> series which proved unexpectedly 
popular from 1957 onwards, fitted well enough into the circuits&#8217; 'family 
entertainment' policy. War films were rather more problematic: despite their 
reputation for stiff upper lip restraint 50s British war films could be violent 
and disturbing. <B>Films like The Cruel Sea</B> (d. Charles Frend, 1953) and 
<B>Yesterday's Enemy</B> (d. Val Guest, 1959) incline one to believe that this 
was one area where mainstream cinema allowed itself to deal with issues 
seriously. </P>
<P>It was with the war films of the early 40s that the British film industry had 
its first sustained taste of commercial and critical success. After 1943 though, 
a violent swing against realism carried British cinema away from the war to the 
exoticism of the Gainsborough costume films, the spiv cycle and the whimsical 
nostalgia of Ealing comedy. There were occasional returns to the war - Carol 
Reed's <B>The Way Ahead</B> (1944), Anthony Asquith's <B>The Way to the 
Stars</B> (1945), Dearden and Relph&#8217;s <B>The Captive Heart</B>(1945) and Powell 
and Pressburger&#8217;s <B>The Small Back Room</B> (1949) - but output declined to a 
trickle. A handful of post-war-adjustment problem films such as <B>Frieda</B> 
(1947) and <B>Mine Own Executioner</B> (l947), were made, and the war-deranged 
hero made sporadic appearances throughout the 50s - most dramatically in Roy 
Baker's <B>Tiger in the Smoke</B> (1956)). But it was not until 1950, when Jack 
Lee's POW camp drama The <B>Wooden Horse </B>and the Herbert Wilcox/Anna Neagle 
resistance bio-pic <B>Odette</B> were 4th and 6th most popular films of the 
year, that war films proper began to regain box-office favour. </P>
<P>The need for everybody to pull together to save Britain from the Nazis had 
instilled many of the best 40s war films with a fascinating if sometimes facile 
populism. The contribution of the ordinary serviceman was acknowledged and 
celebrated along with that of his superiors. <B>In Which We Serve </B>(d. David 
Lean and Noel Coward, 1943), commercially the most successful film of the war 
years, is structured from a series of flashbacks centred around three main 
characters, each representative of a different layer of society. Captain Noel 
Coward is definitively an officer and a gentleman; Bernard Miles, the petty 
officer, is the epitome of lower middle-class eccentricity; and John Mills 
represents the solid, stocky ordinary seaman. Similarly The <B>Captive Heart</B> 
devotes half its story to working class chums Jack Warner and Mervyn Johns and 
the officers are represented chiefly by a déclassé Czech played by Michael 
Redgrave.</P>
<P>The war in 50s films is much more of an officers war, concerned less with its 
effect on society than with the mechanics of escapes, campaigns, operations. 
Working class characters retain only a vestigial function, and suffering wives, 
mums, girlfriends are pushed firmly into the background. <B>The Wooden Horse</B> 
is typical in its concentration on the self-enclosed world of the POW camp, In 
contrast to <B>The Captive Heart</B> where the main plot device centres around 
the intriguing if improbable romantic problems Redgrave has in corresponding 
with the wife of a dead British officer whose identity he has assumed to avoid 
being shot as a partisan, <B>The Wooden Horse</B>, like the other POW camp 
movies of the decade -<B> Albert RN</B> (d. Lewis Gilbert, 1953), <B>The Colditz 
Story</B> (d. Guy Hamilton, 1954), <B>Danger Within</B> (d. Don Chaffey, 1958) - 
is concerned with escape.</P>
<P>Escaping from P0W camps was almost exclusively a middle-class activity. As 
Vincent Firth explains:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The facts are that under the Geneva Convention, officer prisoners 
  cannot be put to manual work. They therefore had all the time in the world to 
  dream up escape plans, while Other Ranks were kept far too busy at work to 
  have any energy left for digging tunnels. <A 
  href="http://www.shu.ac.uk/services/lc/closeup/fiftiesa.htm#note5">(5)</A> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Ironically the one important 50s POW camp film not centrally concerned with 
escape - <B>The Bridge on the River Kwai</B> (d. David Lean, 1958) - uses the 
Japanese camp commanders insistence that the officers should work alongside 
their men as the mainspring of its plot. </P>
<P>Though they now seem one-dimensional, films like <B>The Wooden Horse</B> and 
<B>The Colditz Story</B> based on autobiographical accounts by escaped 
prisoners, and films like <B>Reach for the Sky</B>, <B>The Dam Busters,</B> 
<B>Odette</B>, centered around the exploits of real people, were seen at the 
time as improvements on the openly propagandistic war films of the 40s. Thus 
Helen Fletcher on <B>The Dam Busters:</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The story itself is good enough and they have let it be. No 
  sobbing WAAFs calling B for Baker, no merciless interjections of Other Rank 
  badinage, no misty-eyed bar-maids at the station pub, no brave upward glances 
  at throbbing skies. <A 
  href="http://www.shu.ac.uk/services/lc/closeup/fiftiesa.htm#note6">(6)</A> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>One gets the impression that in the 50s the critics, and presumably the 
film-makers and public, looked back with a degree of embarrassment at the 
portrayal of class harmony in the war years. The 50s saw a gradual rise in 
affluence through full employment, and the possibility, at least for the next 
generation, of class mobility through the extension of higher education. The 
period has to be considered one of fluidity and change for the working class and 
one might suspect an unease among film-makers about how to portray working class 
characters.</P>
<P>One of the breakthroughs of wartime realism was the fuller and more 
sympathetic representation of working class characters hitherto portrayed as 
comic caricatures. But it was very much the old self-enclosed working-class 
which was represented: the cocky but dependable cockney - John Mills in <B>This 
Happy Breed</B> (d. David Lean, 1944), <B>In Which We Serve</B> and <B>Waterloo 
Road </B>(d. Sidney Gilliat, 1945); the tough but good-hearted working class dad 
- Jack Warner in <B>The Captive Heart</B> and <B>Holiday Camp</B> (d. Ken 
Annakin, 1947); the sulky wide-boy with problems - Jimmy Hanley in <B>The Way 
Ahead</B> and <B>It Always Rains on Sunday</B> (d. Robert Hamer, 1947); the poor 
but honest Scots lad - Gordon Jackson in <B>The Foreman Went to France</B> (d. 
Charles Frend, 1942) and <B>Millions Like Us</B> (d. Frank Launder and Sidney 
Gilliat, 1943); and a superb array of battered, world-weary working class wives 
played by Irene Handl, Gladys Henson, Muriel George, Kathleen Harrison, Nancy 
Price. By the 50s these stereotypes didn't quite fit and were relegated to 
comedies and soap operas. It was not until the end of the decade that a new way 
of showing working class characters as young rebels poised between the dead-end 
claustrophobia of the working class ghetto and the stifling hypocrisy of middle 
class society emerged. Until then, war films, with their emphasis on stoical, 
individual bravery, were acceptable in ways that attempts to revive the populism 
of the war years would not have been.</P>
