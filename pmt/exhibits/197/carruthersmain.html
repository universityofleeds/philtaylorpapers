        War since September 11 </font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr Susan Carruthers, 
        Department of International Politics, University of Wales, Aberystwyth</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <i>In my talk I want 
        to discuss what I consider to be the prominent reportorial trends that 
        we have seen since 11 September in the American media. This is going to 
        be a personal perspective on what I think the predominant trends in reporting 
        have been, but also an attempt to fit them into a broader conceptual and 
        somewhat historical context. The underlying questions beneath my discussion 
        are, firstly, to what extent war forms an exceptional case, both in terms 
        of journalistic practice but also in terms of those crucial relationships 
        between journalists and the state, and between media organisations and 
        their publics. Secondly, if war is indeed exceptional, what is particular 
        about a war against terrorism.</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Total War</b><br>
        In the UK there has been clearly much discussion of whether this is a 
        war or not. In the United States, on the other hand, the public discourse 
        about the events of September has included very little discussion at all 
        about whether or not this is war. Most Americans take it absolutely as 
        given that the attacks in September mark the start of an all-out war against 
        the United States, or perhaps more grandiosely a war against freedom, 
        against civilisation, against western values, or what have you. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It probably goes without 
        repetition that the events of September were truly staggering to America. 
        America is not accustomed to accepting casualties on its own soil. There 
        were admittedly some earlier terrorist atrocities in the 1990s, but the 
        dominant parallel which we saw drawn in September was of course with the 
        events in Pearl Harbour. They seem to offer perhaps the only viable historical 
        analogue that many Americans could come up with in terms of an attack 
        on American soil. But of course Pearl Harbour is further away from the 
        mainland of the United States, so in many ways the events of September 
        seem to be without an adequate parallel, leaving the total war of World 
        War Two as the nearest available historical analogy. It is perhaps also 
        worth bearing in mind that World War Two has occupied a more prominent 
        cultural position in American life in the last few years than it maybe 
        did in the seventies and eighties, perhaps most notably exemplified by 
        Spielberg's <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>. And given the Ben Affleck movie 
        of <i>Pearl Harbour</i>, which although pretty lambasted nevertheless 
        was a big box office draw, an analogy with Pearl Harbour and with total 
        war wasn't going to be lost even on the youngest of Americans. So there 
        has been a lot of talk about total war and World War Two. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now I want to suggest 
        that this language of war, and in particular the drawing of parallels 
        with World War Two which wasn't just a total war but which in the American 
        popular recollection was also the good war, has powerful political effects. 
        Casting a campaign against terrorism as a total war serves to legitimise 
        all manner of activities which, if peacetime legality and jurisprudence 
        were to prevail, might seem much more questionable. I am sure that in 
        the UK debates about legitimacy, about bombing, about questions of civilian 
        immunity, about how one dealt with prisoners of war, were more prominent. 
        In America there have been really swingeing allegations of civil rights 
        abuses, particularly against non-American citizens, but the idea that 
        you can simply round up alien citizens who might be Middle Eastern, who 
        might be Muslim, on suspicion of their involvement in terrorist activity, 
        without publicising their crimes or trying them in normal courts of law, 
        has not generated much public or media discussion.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> My argument about 
        all of this is that the language of war acts in a rather paradoxical kind 
        of a way. It denotes a state which isn't peacetime-the normal rules of 
        peacetime jurisprudence have become irrelevant-yet of course this ignores 
        the fact that war over a number of centuries, if rather fitfully, has 
        evolved certain legalities and conventions. Often these are observed more 
        in the breach but nevertheless from Aquinas onwards there has been a just 
        war tradition attempting to codify the ways in which armed forces might 
        engage with one another, proscribing certain activities, enshrining notions 
        like civilian immunity and designating certain actions in war as war crimes. 
        But when war is mobilised as the sort of paradigm for understanding the 
        campaign against terrorism, clearly what is being invoked is something 
        rather different-a much more commonsense notion about what war entails, 
        along the lines of the well worn motif that all is fair in love and war. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So the war against 
        terrorism is something of a rhetorical device, then, which functions as 
        part of a strategy of legitimisation, a signal that the enemy-in this 
        case, of course, an enemy that is incredibly hard to pin down or to identify-can 
        expect the worst since the gloves of legalistic nicety have been removed. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now, of course, there 
        is also a very clear signal for media practitioners that they can expect 
        a reframing by the state and the military of the rules of engagement and-as 
        we conventionally see in wartime-a narrowing of the acceptable limits 
        of dissent and a reinterpretation of the principles of objectivity and 
        distance from official sources which conventional journalists in America 
        like to believe that they operate by. The extent to which there really 
        is a decisive break between war and peace is something that we can talk 
        about and that I will touch on again, but nevertheless it requires journalists 
        to either willingly reconfigure their self-image as objective seekers 
        of truth or else to question the impositions that are being made on them 
        by the state. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the months since 
        September 2001 we have seen a number of practices of the Bush administration 
        which certainly evoke wartime proper in very relevant ways. For example, 
        there has been a very tight rein of course over journalists on the ground 
        in Afghanistan, to the extent that there have been journalists on the 
        ground in Afghanistan. Clearly, in this particular case, the US military 
        have been assisted by inhospitable terrain and of course for at least 
        some of the time by extremely inhospitable Taliban, so the logistics haven't 
        been propitious for a free-ranging journalism with nothing but a backpack 
        satellite dish. Certainly in the United States, we didn't see a good deal 
        of unilateral journalism of the kind that at least some reporters in the 
        Gulf War attempted. There also has been a very considerable reluctance 
        on the part of the Pentagon and the White House to release military news. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There has been limited 
        discussion of this in the broadsheet American press and to the extent 
        that there has been discussion the consensus seems to be that the impositions 
        on the release of news have been even greater than in the 1991 Gulf War. 
        It's been widely remarked that even in the Gulf War where there were considerable 
        constraints put on the kind of reporting that the coalition would permit. 
        Nevertheless some favoured journalists were clustered into pools and were 
        actually stationed with US troops and could see them, however favourable 
        and feature-orientated a journalism that produced. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That hasn't happened 
        this time. There hasn't been any attempt to form pools of US news reporters 
        and actually station them with troops. That has been rationalised on three 
        grounds, the first of which is sensitivity to various coalition partners, 
        particularly countries which may have domestic problems with it being 
        well known that their soil is the base for US forces. Secondly, of course, 
        because a number of the forces, at least initially, were special forces. 
        The other rationalisation was that taking journalists along would jeopardise 
        operational security, that the modus operandi of special forces can't 
        simply be exposed to journalistic scrutiny. The argument is that these 
        aren't like the infantry sent into the Gulf War, so there have to be different 
        rules of engagement.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> We have also seen, 
        particularly from October onwards, a very concerted effort to manage and 
        spin the news stories of the day. One striking aspect of this, though 
        not unprecedented, is the degree to which women have featured as spin 
        doctors. Much has been made in the US media of the fact that a number 
        of the key media and PR personnel in the Bush Administration and those 
        tasked with leading a media war against terrorism are women. The other 
        prominent feature of the propaganda war, if you want to put it in those 
        terms, waged by the White House is that at least in part the war against 
        terrorism is also a war for women's rights. We have seen Laura Bush, the 
        First Lady, for example, pressed into service-possibly, one might scurrilously 
        suggest, because she can string a sentence together rather more fluently 
        than her husband but also to support this prominent theme that one needs 
        to build a liberal coalition to liberate women from the yoke of Islamic 
        fundamentalism. Of course, one must add that casting wars as waged on 
        behalf of civilisation against barbarism in terms of how it treats women, 
        is not a new phenomenon.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> We have also seen 
        a concerted attempt to draw the entertainment media, not just news media, 
        into a closer collaborative relationship with the White House. We have 
        seen what I think historically is very typical sensitivity towards what 
        might be termed terrorist propaganda, concerns such as that al-Jazeera 
        footage of bin Laden might be a covert way for terrorists to send messages 
        to one another. And, of course, the question that is now preoccupying 
        America is the televising of trials. So that is my first theme, then: 
        the war against terrorism as total war.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Patriot war</b><br>
        In America there has been an absolutely phenomenal upsurge of patriot 
        sentiment in public and American life as well as in the media. It's impossible 
        to overstate this, and I don't think this is because I happened to be 
        in Washington where every federal building was draped in the Stars and 
        Stripes. There is a phenomenal upsurge of patriotism-the flag flying everywhere, 
        a wholesale manufacture of Star and Stripes-related merchandise, from 
        ties to women's silk scarves to socks to you-name-it. Before Christmas, 
        department stores were just full of patriotic gifts such as Calvin Klein 
        striped underpants-if you could put a Stars and Stripes on it, there they 
        would indeed be.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> At least in the first 
        instance, this was indeed an organic swelling of feeling in response to 
        quite exceptional events and to the massive loss of life that occurred 
        in September. So I don't think we could suggest, however much both the 
        White House and the media may have tried to exploit and perpetuate it, 
        that this was simply a top-down imposition. I don't think you can manufacture 
        from nowhere a sentiment of that kind. What has been prevalent since then 
        isn't just the commercialisation of this sort of patriot outpouring, but 
        also its ubiquity. It's taken on an element almost of compulsory patriotism. 
        Certainly in media organisations and television news media in particular, 
        there really has been a sense that any pretence, any claim that one is 
        impartial has simply gone by the board. It's very common-indeed it's almost 
        obligatory-to see news anchors wear a Stars and Stripes lapel pin or tie 
        pin to denote their support for America and to show their solidarity.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The NBC logo, which 
        appears in the right hand corner of the television screen, at all times, 
        not just at news broadcasts, has the Stars and Stripes in it. We have 
        seen amongst journalists, particularly television, an almost total willingness 
        to align themselves with the American cause. There are no debates, indeed 
        a debate on the lines that Britain had during the Falklands/ Malvinas 
        War or during the Gulf War, is inconceivable, those old debates about 
        the BBC referring to the 'British troops' rather than 'our boys' and being 
        lambasted by other sections of the media or by conservative backbenchers 
        for a 'horrible display' of even-handedness. In the American television 
        news media it's very clear that 'This is our war and we the media are 
        thoroughly aligned with it.' There are no scruples about that wholehearted 
        alignment with the war against terrorism and certainly no discussion as 
        to whether or not this is indeed or should be a war. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So the issue of America's 
        response to the attacks falls very much into what the academic Daniel 
        Hallin might call this fear of consensus. This doesn't just apply to wars. 
        It applies, in Hallin's terms, to some motherhood and apple pie issues, 
        in other words issues which are so much beyond the scope of controversy 
        that any sense of journalistic rules which require balance or objectivity 
        and so reflect a range of views is simply an irrelevance. This is an issue 
        of consensus and it can be reported in very different, much more celebratory, 
        terms. There has been very little discussion really about the rectitude 
        of the military response to the attacks of September. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There has been a repeated 
        questioning in American public life and in the media about why the 'Arab 
        world', why al-Qaeda in particular, hate Americans. But what I found striking 
        as a visiting alien on American soil was the sort of limited parameters 
        of acceptable answers to that question. Indeed some opinion-formers in 
        the media suggested that it wasn't really appropriate to be asking the 
        question about motives at all, that the attacks themselves were so inexcusable 
        and so far into the realms of the psychotic and irrational that even to 
        begin to try to fathom motives for them was to travel unacceptably far 
        in the direction of excusing the attacks. So we have got this curious 
        situation where repeatedly the Americans are asking, 'Why did they hate 
        us, what does this mean, what did we do?' and yet a willingness to countenance 
        only some answers to that question. In particular, it's suddenly very 
        difficult to answer that question by making any reference to American 
        foreign policy. In other words, to suggest that, at least as far as some 
        quarters of Arabic opinion are concerned, American foreign policy may 
        have something to do with that answer is very problematic. To suggest 
        that perhaps America's long-standing support of Israel, the ongoing sanctions 
        and periodic bombings of Iraq, the stationing of American troops on Saudi 
        soil close to many sacred sights of Islam and so on, to suggest that others 
        around the world have a less benign interpretation of American power is 
        profoundly problematic for many Americans. Perhaps particularly in the 
        <i>New York Times</i> even to broach that question is to open oneself 
        to charges not just of near treason against the war on terrorism but also 
        in some quarters of anti-Semitism. To criticise American policy vis-ˆ-vis 
        Israel, if you look at the letters page in the New York Times, is often 
        to be charged with being an anti-Semite.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> All of these factors 
        combine to produce a climate of very restricted speech about why the 11 
        September attacks actually happened. The kinds of explanations which are 
        permissible of course then tend to be relegated to the realm of psychology, 
        often ignoring the political dimensions of what might motivate anti-American 
        sentiment, suggesting instead that people in the Middle East or in the 
        'Muslim world' are simply resentful of America's material success and 
        that there's a sort of psychotic jealously at work amongst people who 
        simply haven't been able to master modernity or get hip to globalisation. 
        Or the argument is made that America symbolises certain values of freedom 
        and tolerance which are anathema to the Taliban and al-Qaeda. So a set 
        of explanations prevails in the media which tends to explain September 
        11 in terms of Emirate psychology.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> What we have also 
        seen is a sense, certainly in the Administration, that since these views 
        are profoundly misguided, that they are therefore susceptible to being 
        ameliorated and indeed changed if American propaganda, for want of a better 
        word, does a better job of selling America to the world and in particular 
        to the Muslim world. So in the months since the attacks we have periodically 
        seen discussion of renewing a 'campaign of truth'. This was very relevant 
        for me because I was in America working on a project on the early Cold 
        War and a 'campaign of truth' is an early fifties phrase. President Truman 
        in 1950 launched the first such campaign of truth designed to sell the 
        virtues of the American way of life to those who might be susceptible 
        to Soviet propaganda. There has been, then, a disinterring of a historical 
        motif and discussion also of many of the same channels as being vehicles 
        for launching a campaign of truth about American power and the benevolence 
        of America's presence and role in the world. In particular a key priority 
        of the State Department has been a beefed-up role for Voice of America 
        and particularly VOA broadcasts in Pashtun and to the former Soviet Republics.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> There have also been 
        some very early Cold War debates about whether VOA itself perhaps was 
        an untrustworthy organisation. Voice of America, founded during World 
        War Two, is perhaps the nearest equivalent to the BBC World Service. Although 
        it is, if anything, closer to the American state than BBC World Service 
        to the British state, nevertheless by charter it's intended to be at least 
        in its news presentation adherent to various principles of objectivity, 
        and balance. Then in its editorial sections it can deliver a much more 
        forthrightly pro-American line. This has got VOA into trouble in some 
        quarters on Capitol Hill. In November a number of Republicans in Congress 
        passed legislation which would appropriate funds to set up Radio Free 
        Afghanistan very much along the lines of Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty 
        and other Cold War expedients, which broadcast behind the Iron Curtain 
        and which purported not to be anything to do with the American Government 
        although clandestinely they were funded by the CIA. They were much more 
        forthright in their anti-Soviet line and clearly a number of Republicans 
        have been concerned that the VOA is too even-handed and that what is needed 
        is something which makes no scruples about being both profoundly anti-Taliban 
        and vehemently pro-American. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another self-conscious 
        invocation of World War Two has been the way that the White House from 
        an early stage has sought to enmesh Hollywood into the campaign. What 
        we perhaps need to bear in mind is that the Bush administration suddenly 
        perceived that Hollywood was full of pinko-lefty Clinton-loving types. 
        Certainly many of the more prominent studio executives as well as stars 
        had lent their lustre to Gore's election campaign and before that to the 
        cause of Clinton, so there really was work to be done to make sure that 
        Hollywood was on side playing its part in the war against terrorism.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Now World War Two 
        looms very large in all of this and in particular the recurrent motif 
        has been Frank Capra's 'Why We Fight' series of motivational films produced 
        during World War Two. A number of the famous American directors of the 
        time-John Houston, John Ford-actually joined various branches of the US 
        armed services to make patriotic films to commemorate the war effort in 
        celluloid during the war. All that history of patriotic collaboration 
        between the US military and Hollywood has been reanimated since September. 
        This does pose certain questions. During World War Two a lot of Hollywood's 
        patriotic film-making was really aimed at explaining and selling World 
        War Two to an American public that often had a rather scant idea about 
        what the war in Europe and the war in the Pacific were actually about. 
        There was a profound job to be done to explain to Americans why the Allies 
        were fighting the Axis powers and crucially why the World War also needed 
        to be America's War, although after Pearl Harbour that wasn't quite such 
        a problem. Hollywood's role was largely of selling the war to Americans, 
        to American service personnel and then more widely to America's allies 
        showing solidarity.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In this case it's 
        harder to know exactly what's being conceived for Hollywood. Certainly 
        already Hollywood is producing even more rapidly a spate of very pro-military 
        war-themed films. On the other hand we might argue that Hollywood is precisely 
        part of the problem-in other words, if you want to explain, as many people 
        have done, the tensions and sentiments that produced the events of 11 
        September in the first place, as a part of a backlash against America 
        and American cultural imperialism, then Hollywood looks rather more like 
        part of the problem than part of the solution. It's not quite clear how 
        Hollywood can alleviate that. Certainly if the intention is that Hollywood 
        makes films that sell the American way of life, well, arguably Hollywood 
        does very well at doing precisely that already, but exporting those films 
        abroad may only exacerbate precisely those tensions.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The latest announcement 
        from the world of Hollywood-White House liaison just before Christmas 
        was that Hollywood would produce a short film aimed predominately at world 
        Muslim opinion featuring Mohammed Ali as America's most famous convert 
        to Islam, who would explain that the war against terrorism was not indeed 
        a war against Islam. Of course there is some synergy between mobilising 
        Mohammed Ali and the release on Christmas Day in the States of the new 
        Will Smith vehicle, <i>Ali</i>. It's a curious overlap of fictionalising 
        by Hollywood of Ali's life and then actually using him in person to perform 
        this role.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Parochial War 
        </b><br>
        One highly striking feature of the media war was how very inwardly focused 
        it was. To a considerable extent, this confirms trends which have been 
        visible for at least a decade and probably much longer than that. On the 
        one hand the 1990s saw the rise of so-called global media, with CNN achieving 
        its hegemony in that market largely thanks to the Gulf War, but on the 
        other hand, while you have these 24-hour rolling news services with a 
        more international cast, the kinds of news provided by American terrestrial 
        broadcasters was increasingly parochial-this in a country which is not 
        renowned for the percentage of news airtime devoted to foreign affairs 
        in the first case. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The point I want to 
        make here isn't just that there was remarkably little debate over the 
        campaign of aerial bombardment and over the way the war against terrorism 
        was prosecuted in Afghanistan. The point is more that, for at least much 
        of the time, that simply wasn't the story. Instead two stories, or perhaps 
        two parts of the same story, predominated: the aftermath of the attack 
        on America itself, and in particular the aftermath of the World Trade 
        Center bombings. Perhaps in journalistic terms one of the most striking 
        developments was how the <i>New York Times</i> responded. It generated 
        an entire new section called 'A Nation Challenged', dealing not only with 
        the updates from Afghanistan and attempts to secure a global coalition, 
        but also-and perhaps it was most read for this-two or three, sometimes 
        four, pages devoted to small obituaries and photographs of those who had 
        lost their lives in the attacks on the World Trade Center and on the Pentagon. 
        The section only came to an end on January 1, 2002, which the <i>New York 
        Times</i> presumably felt was a suitable moment to reincorporate news 
        about the war on terrorism within its main news pages.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the striking 
        untold stories of those attacks is the large number of victims whose identities 
        won't ever be known, the large number of illegal immigrant workers who 
        were doing the invisible work of maintaining the Twin Towers and who lost 
        their lives in the attacks. The huge volume of domestic coverage about 
        the impact on America has had as a submerged subplot issues of race and 
        immigration, a subplot that has surfaced periodically but often without 
        being fully articulated. The obituaries are a case in point. By and large 
        they of course memorialised the high-achieving brokers with Cantor Fitzgerald. 
        The families of many of the cleaners, janitors and so on are simply too 
        scared of being deported to report that their relatives lost their lives. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second big story, 
        certainly since October, has been anthrax. Again there was a somewhat 
        visible racial subplot. Washington DC is an atypical American city in 
        that white Americans are hugely outnumbered by Afro-Americans. But of 
        course the division of labour is marked in that Afro-Americans tend to 
        do the more menial jobs, as is indeed typical in American cities. What 
        became clear in the anthrax story was the vast discrepancy between how 
        the predominately, though not exclusively, white staffers on Capitol Hill 
        were treated when the contaminated letter to Senator Tom Daschle was discovered, 
        and how black workers were treated. Capitol Hill staff were immediately 
        whisked away, given a 90-day course of antibiotics and so on, to the extent 
        that some people I know who work there are actually more concerned about 
        the long-term health effects of the attempts to decontaminate buildings 
        than about the letter in the first place. In contrast, postal workers 
        were dealt with very tardily once anthrax-laced letters were found in 
        the postal depot in south Washington. In fact, only after some postal 
        workers died were they given a handful, a four-days course, of antibiotics 
        as a prophylactic. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The one caveat I would 
        offer to my earlier comment about how little dissent we have seen about 
        the conduct of the war against terrorism relates to this sphere of domestic 
        politics. By November it was clear that the bipartisan coalition which 
        had been absolutely flawless was beginning to come apart. It became possible 
        on the Hill to criticise some aspects of how the war against terrorism 
        was being waged, but more or less exclusively domestic elements. So questions 
        about how anthrax was being handled and the whole fiasco of how baggage 
        was handled in the airports were raised. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By way of conclusion, 
        let me just offer a few more generalised thoughts and a little bit of 
        historical context about war in the media and in particular about the 
        extent to which terrorism may be a particular case of what already may 
        be a particular case, in other words war. I found myself wanting to nuance 
        my conclusions. Clearly, campaigns against what is called terrorism generate 
        particular rules. The attacks and their aftermath have led to a state 
        of relations between the White House and journalists and between journalists 
        and their publics which demonstrates elements of exceptionalism.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Nevertheless, many 
        of the phenomena that I tried to draw out in my remarks can be fitted 
        into a broader set of phenomena which recur when states try to deal with 
        terrorism-and terrorism itself falls into a curious grey area both legally 
        and morally with respect to war and to the rules of war. Do no rules apply 
        when one seems to be dealing with an enemy which almost by definition 
        doesn't abide either by peacetime juridical codes or by codes that have 
        evolved governing just war conduct? So terrorism itself occurs in this 
        odd condition of profound uncertainty about what rules, if any, might 
        apply.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> We have seen in this 
        case, as we have seen in many other campaigns against terrorism, that 
        journalists are profoundly anxious about behaving in ways that might be 
        construed as supportive of terrorism or perhaps insufficiently supportive 
        of a state's campaign against terrorism. Since no one really knows who 
        the terrorists might be, how to target them or how to defeat them, that 
        leads to a good deal of flexibility as to what kinds of behaviour might 
        be inadmissible or dangerous. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then there's the whole 
        idea of a symbiotic relationship between terrorists and news organisations, 
        which has a very long history, not just to Margaret Thatcher's famous 
        dictum that publicity is the oxygen of terrorism, but back through the 
        twentieth century, certainly to the 1940s when British governments were 
        facing what they called terrorism in Palestine or to places like Malaya, 
        Kenya and Cyprus in the 1940s and 1950s. The idee fixe, the conventional 
        wisdom, has been that terrorists were essentially publicity seekers and 
        that wittingly or otherwise news organisations end up playing into the 
        terrorists' hands. That of course makes journalists very cautious about 
        the very easily made charge that their behaviour is in some way or other 
        aiding the cause of terrorism. Perhaps one of the sorest points that recurs 
        in such campaigns is the question of interviews-is it appropriate to interview 
        terrorists or so-called terrorists and terrorist suspects in the news 
        media, particularly on television? Recurrently there is a debate between 
        those who think that any appearance is going to legitimise and lend unwarranted 
        credibility to such individuals and those who would argue that if you 
        put such people on television they will in fact do a far more effective 
        job of damning themselves than official propaganda ever could.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In this case I think 
        we have seen the pendulum swing quite markedly from the initial position 
        of the Administration, which was to want to prohibit any appearances by 
        al-Qaeda spokesmen, towards a position of it being more beneficial to 
        the state to air footage of bin Laden so that normal people will realise 
        how beyond the pale he is. So my final conclusion, then, is that terrorism 
        is, yes, sui generis. Nevertheless, if we look back historically we can 
        find that there are precedents both for how media disport themselves vis-&agrave;-vis 
        states in peacetime but also recurrent parallels with other wars against 
        terrorism. </font></p>
