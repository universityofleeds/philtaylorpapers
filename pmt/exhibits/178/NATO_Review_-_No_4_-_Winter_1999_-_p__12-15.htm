      <P>Kosovo is a dramatic example of a larger problem - how should NATO 
      define its mission in the Information Age? During the Cold War, 
      containment of Soviet power provided a North Star to guide NATO policy. 
      NATO's official job was simple and well-defined: deter the Warsaw Pact 
      from launching an invasion against member states. After the collapse of 
      the Soviet Union, what should be the limits of NATO's mission? With the 
      Kosovo crisis, NATO fired its first shots in anger in a region outside the 
      Alliance's treaty area, on declared humanitarian grounds. What criteria 
      might NATO draw on to guide policy on the threat, or use, of its force in 
      the new strategic environment of the 21st century?<BR></P>
      <H4><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#324983>The world in 
      the Information Age</FONT><BR></H4>
      <P>We need first to have a clear sense of the distribution of power in the 
      Information Age. Some people see the end of the bipolar world leaving 
      multipolarity in its stead, but that is not a very good description of a 
      world in which one country, the United States, is so much more powerful 
      than all the others. On the other hand, unipolarity is not a very good 
      description either, because it exaggerates the degree to which the United 
      States is able to attain what it wants. <BR></P>
      <P>Instead, power today is distributed like a three-dimensional chess 
      game. The top military board is unipolar, with the United States far 
      outstripping all other states. The middle economic board is multipolar, 
      with the United States, Europe and Japan accounting for two thirds of 
      world product. However, the bottom board of transnational relations that 
      cross borders outside the control of governments has a more dispersed 
      structure of power. <BR></P>
      <P>This complexity makes policy-making more difficult. It means playing on 
      several boards at the same time. Moreover, while it is important not to 
      ignore the continuing importance of military force for some purposes, it 
      is equally important not to be misled by military unipolarity into 
      thinking that US power is greater than it is in other dimensions. The 
      United States is a preponderant, but not dominant, power.<BR></P>
      <P>Another distinction to keep in mind is that between "hard power" - a 
      country's economic and military power to coerce - and "soft power", the 
      ability to attract through cultural and ideological appeal (<A 
      href="http://www.nato.int/docu/review/1999/9904-03.htm#FN1">1</A>). The 
      Western democratic and humanitarian values that NATO was charged with 
      defending in 1949 are significant sources of soft power. Both hard and 
      soft power are vital but, in the Information Age, soft power is taking on 
      more importance.<BR></P>
      <P>Massive flows of cheap information have expanded the number of 
      transnational channels of contacts across national borders. Global markets 
      and non-governmental actors play a larger role. States are more easily 
      pen-etrated and less like the classic realist model of solid billiard 
      balls bouncing off each other. As a result, political leaders find it more 
      difficult to maintain a coherent set of priorities in foreign policy 
      issues and more difficult to articulate a single national 
interest.<BR></P>
      <P>Different aspects of the Information Age cut in different directions in 
      terms of NATO members' collective interests. On the one hand, a good case 
      can be made that the information revolution will have long-term effects 
      that benefit democracies. Democratic societies can create credible 
      information because they are not threatened by it. Authoritarian states 
      will have more trouble. Governments can limit their citizens' access to 
      the Internet and global markets, but they will pay a high price if they do 
      so. Singapore and China, for example, are currently wrestling with these 
      problems.<BR></P>
      <H4><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#324983>The "CNN 
      effect"</FONT><BR></H4>
      <P>On the other hand, some aspects of the Information Age are less benign. 
      The free flow of broadcast information in open societies has always had an 
      impact on public opinion and the formulation of foreign policy, but now 
      the flows have increased and shortened news cycles have reduced the time 
      for deliberation. By focusing on certain conflicts and human rights 
      problems, broadcasts pressure politicians to respond to some foreign 
      problems and not others. The so-called "CNN effect" makes it harder to 
      keep some items off the top of the public agenda that might otherwise 
      warrant a lower priority. Now, with the added interactivity of activist 
      groups on the Internet, it will be harder than ever for leaders in 
      democracies to maintain a consistent agenda of priorities.<BR></P>

            </FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
      <P>Another problem is the effect of transnational information flows on the 
      stability of national communities. The Canadian media guru, Marshall 
      McLuhan, once prophesied that communications technologies would turn the 
      world into a global village. Instead of a single cosmopolitan village, 
      they may be producing a jumble of global villages, with all the parochial 
      hatreds that the word "village" implies, but also with greater awareness 
      of global inequalities. Global economic forces are disrupting traditional 
      lifestyles, and the effects are to increase economic integration and 
      communal disintegration at the same time. <BR></P>
      <P>This is particularly true of weak states left in the aftermath of the 
      collapse of the Soviet empire and the old European empires in Africa. 
      Political entrepreneurs use inexpensive information channels to 
      mobilise<BR>discontent, provoking the emergence of either sub-national 
      tribal communities, repressive nationalism, or transnational ethnic and 
      religious communities. This in turn leads to increased demands for 
      self-determination, increased violence, and violation of human rights - 
      all in the presence of television cameras and the Internet. The result is 
      to put a difficult set of issues on the foreign policy agenda.<BR></P>
      <H4><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#324983>Different 
      classes of security risks</FONT><BR></H4>
      <P>William Perry and Ashton Carter have recently suggested a list of risks 
      to US security, (<A 
      href="http://www.nato.int/docu/review/1999/9904-03.htm#FN2">2</A>) which 
      can also be profitably applied to NATO's strategic interests:<BR></P>
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>The "<B>A list</B>" of threats on the scale that the Soviet Union 
        presented to Western survival; 
        <LI>The "<B>B list</B>" of imminent threats to Western interests (but 
        not survival) such as was seen in the Gulf War; 
        <LI>The "<B>C list</B>" of important contingencies that indirectly 
        affect Western security, but do not directly threaten Western interests, 
        such as the crises in Kosovo, Bosnia, Somalia, and Rwanda.<BR></LI></UL>
      <P></P>
      <P>It is striking how the "C list" has dominated the US foreign policy 
      agenda and that a "C list" crisis precipitated NATO's first military 
      action in its 50-year history. Carter and Perry speculate that this is 
      because of the absence of "A list" threats since the end of the Cold War. 
      But another reason is the ability of "C list" issues to dominate media 
      attention in the Information Age. Dramatic visual portrays of immediate 
      human conflict and suffering are far easier to convey to the public, than 
      "A list" abstractions like the possibility of a "Weimar Russia" or the 
      potential collapse of the international system of trade and investment. 
      Yet, if these larger strategic issues were to turn out badly, they would 
      have a far greater impact on the lives of most ordinary citizens of NATO 
      countries.<BR></P>

      <P>The reality of the Information Age is that "C list" issues in which 
      human rights are a key factor, like Somalia, Bosnia and Kosovo, force 
      themselves to the foreground because of their ability to command 
      attention. But a human rights policy is not a strategic policy: it is an 
      important part of foreign policy. During the Cold War, this often meant 
      that the West tolerated human rights abuses by regimes that were crucial 
      to balancing Soviet power - for example, in South Korea before its 
      transition to democracy.<BR></P>
      <P>But the greater attention being devoted to humanitarian concerns often 
      diverts attention from "A list" strategic issues. Also, since moral 
      arguments are used as trumps, and pictures are more powerful than words, 
      arguments about trade-offs are often emotional and difficult.<BR></P>
      <P>The problem with such cases is that the humanitarian interest that 
      instigates the action often turns out to be a mile wide and an inch deep. 
      For example, the American impulse to help starving Somalis (whose food 
      supply was being interrupted by various warlords) vanished in the face of 
      dead US soldiers being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu. This is 
      sometimes attributed to a popular reluctance in America to accept 
      casualties. But that is too simple. Americans went into the Gulf War 
      expecting some ten thousand casualties, but there was more at stake then 
      than simply humanitarian issues. More properly expressed, Americans are 
      reluctant to accept casualties when their only interests are 
      unreciprocated humanitarian interests. <BR></P>
      <P>Ironically, the reaction against cases such as Somalia may not only 
      divert attention and limit willingness to support "A list" interests, but 
      may also interfere with action in more serious humanitarian crises. One of 
      the direct effects of the Somalia disaster was the failure of the United 
      States, along with other countries, to support and reinforce the United 
      Nations peacekeeping force in Rwanda that could have limited a true 
      genocide in 1994.<BR></P>

      <P>There are no easy answers for such cases. We could not simply turn off 
      the television or unplug our computers, even if we wanted to. The "C list" 
      cannot simply be ignored. But there are certain lessons to be drawn and 
      prudently applied that may help integrate such issues into the wider 
      strategy for advancing the national interest. <BR></P>
      <P>First, there are many degrees of humanitarian concern and many degrees 
      of intervention such as condemnation, sanctions targeted on individuals, 
      broad sanctions, and various uses of force. NATO should save the use of 
      force only for the more flagrant cases. <BR></P>
      <P>Second, when the Alliance does use force, it is worth remembering some 
      principles of "just war" doctrine: the cause should be just in the eyes of 
      others; we should be discriminating in our choice of means to avoid unduly 
      punishing the innocent; our means must be proportional to our ends; and, 
      there should be a high probability (rather than wishful thinking) of good 
      consequences.<BR></P>
      <P>Third, NATO countries should generally avoid the use of force, except 
      in cases where our humanitarian interests are reinforced by the existence 
      of other strong strategic interests. This was the case in the Gulf War, 
      where the West was concerned not only with the aggression against Kuwait, 
      but also with energy supplies and regional allies.<BR></P>
      <P>Fourth, public reaction to humanitarian crises may differ from one 
      democracy to the other. Therefore, NATO should welcome the idea of 
      combined joint task forces that would be separable, but not separate, from 
      the Alliance and encourage a greater European willingness and ability to 
      take the lead on such issues.<BR></P>
      <P>Fifth, we should be clearer in our definition of, and responses to, 
      genuine cases of genocide. The West has a real humanitarian interest in 
      not letting another Holocaust occur. Yet, we did just that in Rwanda in 
      1994. We need to do more to organise prevention and response to real cases 
      of genocide. Unfortunately, the Genocide Convention is written so loosely 
      and the term so abused for political purposes, that there is a danger of 
      it becoming trivialised. But a strict historical interpretation based on 
      the precedents of the Holocaust and Rwanda in 1994 can help to avoid such 
      pitfalls.<BR></P>
      <P>Lastly, NATO countries should be very wary about intervening in civil 
      wars over self-determination. The principle is dangerously ambiguous; 
      atrocities are often committed on both sides ("reciprocal genocide"); and 
      the precedents can have disastrous consequences.<BR></P>
      <P>None of these criteria solve the problem of how to determine NATO's 
      mission in the Information Age. But better consequences will flow from a 
      starting point in which the Alliance's values are related to its power, 
      and in which any humanitarian mission is rationally pursued within prudent 
      limits. </P>
