<P>
<H2>The Information Warfare Mania</H2>
<P></CENTER>
<P>The hottest buzzword in the current American military establishment is 
<STRONG>information warfare (IW)</STRONG>. This term is used as if it were 
denotative of something precise and analyzable. A reading of the military and 
non-military literature reveals that it is at best a label of loose 
connotations. These connotations range from specifically technical tactics 
(e.g., hacking) through more subtle manipulations (e.g., psychological 
operations) to a broad epochal boundary in techno-military history. 
<P>The most obvious (and widely circulated) spin on the IW morass is to focus on 
the offensive and defensive manipulation of information systems and networks -- 
i.e., 'hacking', as that term has come to be misused in the popular press. 
Firewalls are the latest consumer items for the fashion-conscious enterprise, 
just as email was a few years ago and desktop microcomputers before that. This 
Web site will not concentrate solely on that portion of the IW mania. For one 
thing, resources addressing computer and information security issues (from both 
offensive and defensive perspectives) are abundant. More importantly, this line 
of development is little more than a wholesale transfer of the waning industrial 
mindset to a new arena. From this vantage, information systems comprise a space 
or landscape (e.g., the Internet) with affordances for disruption, encirclement, 
and other analogues to conventional contests for territory (or at least 
territorial control). The threats and opportunities are tangible -- make no 
mistake -- but the attention they receive is symptomatic of the fact that many 
people still don't quite 'get it'. 
<P>The primary reason this Web site will concentrate on other issues is that I 
am confident that the most significant outcomes of the present transformations 
will have to do with the 'information' transferred, processed, and otherwise 
exploited via information systems, not the systems themselves. Information 
systems are still subject to 'territorialization', in both the literal and the 
currently trendy post-modernist senses. 'Information', on the other hand, defies 
constraint by parameters such as unique locus or finite production. This means 
that in the realm of 'information' (as opposed to the realm of the information 
systems), the operant 'metaphysics' and dynamics are unlike those of the 
physical space. This in turn implies that the means for leveraging one's own 
interests (e.g., tools, tactics...) in this information realm will be (or at 
least can be) qualitatively different from the means applied to leverage the 
physical space. 
<P>Another reason for such a focus is that the degree to which 'warfare' becomes 
innate to everyday life will be directly proportional to the degree to which 
said 'warfare' is conducted exclusively within the 'information realm'. Tactical 
maneuvering in this 'information realm' does not require the extraordinary 
equipment associated with physical military campaigns (e.g., fighters, tanks). 
Moreover, it requires no equipment of extraordinary cost. This opens up the 
means for 'warfare' to non-national players such as shadow groups and 
individuals anytime and anywhere.

<P>
<H2>The Categories of IW Foci to Date</H2>
<P></CENTER>This, then, is the state of IW discussion at the time of this 
writing -- a conglomeration of viewpoints decomposable into a few basic 
categories: 
<P>
<DL>
  <DT><STRONG>Third-Wave Warform</STRONG> 
  <P></P>
  <DD>This category subsumes the broad conventional view that the IT Revolution 
  is having (or will inevitably have...) a correspondingly revolutionary effect 
  on the means and the manner by which military forces operate. The majority of 
  the literature to be found in military publications and on the Internet 
  addresses this vision. From this perspective, IW is a new wrinkle in an 
  established geopolitical game -- a game presumably to be prosecuted in terms 
  of the national and transnational architectures already established. 
  Regardless of one's opinion of this viewpoint's viability, it should be clear 
  that (at least for the short term) this entrenched perspective will be the one 
  guiding institutional IW developments. 
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG>Virtual Porticulli</STRONG> 
  <P></P>
  <DD>This category (which is not mutually exclusive with 'Third-Wave Warform') 
  subsumes those perspectives, approaches, and tactics which reduce all of IW to 
  a unimodal defensive posture -- i.e., addressing all cyberspace risks through 
  armoring / guarding / patrolling those systems (computers, LANs, etc.) within 
  one's own zone of control. The point is not to claim that defensive IW 
  (COMPSEC, COMSEC, INFOSEC) has no place in the grand scheme of things. Rather, 
  it is to highlight the fact that considerable interest in the politicomilitary 
  potential of cyberspace has devolved into planning and acquisition focused 
  narrowly on the integrity of specific nodes or regions within that realm. 
  While attention to own-force assets is certainly prudent, attention to 
  <CITE>only</CITE> one's own 'back yard' may lead to a blindered and 
  short-sighted isolation -- a condition increasing, rather than decreasing, 
  own-force vulnerabilities in the broad context of the Net. 
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG>Free-Form Hype-Pretext</STRONG> 
  <P></P>
  <DD>This catch-all category subsumes all those who are merely waving 'IW' and 
  related terminology about to attract attention to their products and services. 
  The military industrial complex is working overtime to append 'information 
  warfare' to descriptions of threats, solutions, and procurements. Owing to the 
  fluid and ill-defined nature of the IT Revolution, it is all too easy to wrap 
  the IW label around peripheral or conventional issues to extend their 'shelf 
  life'. Furthermore, a number of consulting firms are milking the IW label for 
  profits -- invoking cyberwar as a bogeyman to stimulate sales of (e.g.) 
  security products and services. As a result of all this label-exploitation, IW 
  is now invoked in the same breath as topics ranging from corporate 
  intelligence gathering to advertising to hardware-level encryption support. 
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG>Samurai Semiotics</STRONG> 
  <P></P>
  <DD>This category subsumes the view that the IT Revolution is perhaps a 
  symptom of broad changes being wrought in all arenas -- social, cultural, and 
  political. This viewpoint prioritizes the manipulation of symbolic information 
  in accordance with 'postmodern' foci on language, signs and signification. The 
  primary potential of IW is framed with respect to information itself, rather 
  than with respect to information systems operant within the established 
  architecture of nation states and their alliances. In the long term, this 
  perspective is likely to be of greater significance than the one above, if for 
  no other reason than that it augurs a complete rethinking of what we mean by 
  'warfare'. </DD></DL>
<P>This is not to say that all IW work falls neatly into one or another of these 
categories. Much of the core literature splits between the first and the third 
categories, while the second is primarily represented in IW theory papers and 
that body of literature lying outside the circle of the military and its 
attendant industrial base. We will have to wait and see how things sort 
themselves out eventually. In the mean time, I suggest you track the evolution 
of thinking on 'third-wave warforms', consider reasonable protection without 
betting your future on 'virtual porticulli', bear in mind the prospect of 
'samurai semiotics', and take care to avoid undue influence from the 'free-form 
hype-pretext'.

      <BLOCKQUOTE>The broad impact of IT on the military is generally termed a 
        <CITE>Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA)</CITE> , and this phrase has 
        become an icon for whatever it might be that's occurring. Attempts to 
        delineate and analyze the RMA are largely associated with the notion of 
        IW as a <CITE>third-wave warform</CITE> -- i.e., an emerging variation 
        on established military themes and elements. This set of pages gives an 
        overview of the RMA and the key themes underlying its canonical

        common terminology one must wrestle with in exploring the IW literature. 
        The <CITE>Glossary</CITE> is an evolving product, attempting to address

        the subject of information warfare. There is a great deal of redundancy

        assessed to be worthwhile. Sites judged to be short on actual content, 
        limited in demonstrated scope and/or depth, or too proprietary to be of 
        much use to the interested IW researcher have been filtered out.
