War is a great educator – for everybody. Each subsequent war, if not each
battle, almost always comes as a unique experience to the Generals and
even the Field Marshals as it does to all Governments. No one is immune
from this learning process: it applies to all leaders, Presidents, Prime
Ministers and even editors and spin doctors. Once war breaks out everyone
is thrown onto life’s learning curve. No matter how learned and experienced
the “experts” regard themselves, war has a nasty habit of producing the
unexpected. Journalists, on the whole, are aware of this and no matter
how often a war correspondent has reported from the “battle front” the
next war is always different. The best of war correspondents know this –
as if by nature: and the younger ones quickly pick up the grim knowledge.
Yet, this time, in Afghanistan, it is more different than ever.<P>

Of course there is always a tendancy in the media, almost overnight, for
everyone to become a military specialist. No need to have been to
Sandhurst, Cranwell or Dartmouth to qualify: knock out a thousand or two
thousand words on how armies, air forces and navies should behave. We
become arm-chair Generals at the sound of the first gunshot. Then we can
pontificate on television and radio as well. The mere access to a column in
a national newspaper or any microphone confers a certain authority on even
the most amateurish pen – or voice. To be sure, some of it reads and sounds
very persuasive. And indeed some of it is authoritative. Moreover the longer
the war lasts the more experienced journalists become. That is when you
start to notice the increasing care, reservation and even humility creeping
into the pieces. For the other inescapable law of war is that it becomes more,
not less, complex as it develops. That is why it is such a particularly humbling
educator.<P>

What has been especially notable about the extraordinary war against
terrorism – if that is to remain the description, dubious though it has to
be – has been the return to some outstanding newspaper reporting. And
we specify, particularly, newspaper reporting. For years this journal, along
with many others in our trade, has complained about the virtual disappearance
of top-class reporting. Indeed there has been a craven absence of
editors who were prepared to clear a page to provide space for the kind of
writing and observation which once gave British newspapers some of the
finest reporters [and not just war reporters] in journalism. That did not
happen during the Gulf War – or, at best, only in rare small doses; it happened
too infrequently in the prolonged Balkan crisis; but it has been happening
in this highly unusual conflict around Afghanistan. We have already
witnessed examples of outstanding descriptive reporting, equal to some of
the best from the Viet Nam period, despite the exceptional difficulties all
journalists have been facing trying to cover the conflict areas. Indeed one of
the critical differences, compared with the Gulf War, the Balkans fighting,
the Falklands or Viet Nam, has been the lack of effective and credible military
briefings. From the outset the United States administration has held
the tightest control over media briefings – perhaps because the military
men in the Pentagon are as confused as most other people. In London the
Ministry of Defence, never renowned for its openness, has been classically
tight-lipped. The reporters, out there along the eery dustbowls of the
Afghan mountain ranges, have had a hell of a time – just to keep the dust
out of their eyes as well as in search of truth. [see page 12 for Anthony
Loyd’s brilliant description of life in the battlezone].<P>

<BR>
<H4>Imagination</H4>

Whatever else can be said of Mr Bin Laden he has certainly been responsible
for resurrecting some fine reporting. A whole new generation of young
war correspondents has been introduced to a newspaper reading public and
television viewers – to audiences which in both cases have grown in their
demand for real news. It is a demand to which the national, and regional,
newspapers have responded with imagination and a creative energy not seen
in British journalism for a long time. And this applies particularly to the
tabloids – notably <I>The Mirror</I> which, as Brian MacArthur observed in his
<I>Times</I> media column [October 19], has returned to the kind of <I>Daily Mirror</I>
journalism of “the glory days of Hugh Cudlipp”. Praise indeed for Piers
Morgan’s <I>Mirror</I>.<P>

But it is unjust to single out one paper or even one category of the
newspapers; all the nationals have responded with high quality professionalism
with some outstanding coverage in <I>The Times</I>, <I>Daily Telegraph</I>, <I>Guardian</I> and
<I>Financial Times</I>. Television has had more of a struggle partly for technical
reasons, as well as the huge cost of supporting camera crews in the war zone;
but also because, we might ask: has this war so far shown some of the limitations
of the camera-on-the-spot as distinct from the notebook-in-the-hand?
Answer: probably.<P>

Yet it is on television more than in newspapers that we have seem the
emergence of half a dozen new stars of women war reporters – Jacky
Rowland, already seasoned in North Africa and Kosovo, now Jerusalem;
Susannah Price, Kate Clarke both in Pakistan and Afghanistan; as well as the
well established, accomplished brilliance of Janine di Giovanni. And in
saluting these fine new stars let us also salute the courage of so many others
in a war that has already sadly cost the lives of seven brave journalists.<P>

Television has certainly tried very hard to overcome serious practical
problems. An extra £10 million was made available to the BBC News. It has
24 reporters plus technical staff in the battle areas. CNN has 47 personnel
in Pakistan and Afghanistan and is reported to be spending over £500,000 a
week. ITN is said to be spending about £300,000 a week; Sky TV about the
same. So far the costs are being borne with a determined commitment to
provide the coverage. Yet as the war drags on and moves relentlessly into
the quicksands of an unpredictable future the money will become a problem
as audiences slip away.<P>

Since September 11 war, the great educator, has re-invigorated our journalism.
It has not yet produced the very special qualities of critical but
accurate, emotionally startling but clinically truthful memorable descriptives
of a James Cameron, wherever he was reporting from;  a John Pilger
reporting from Viet Nam has not yet been replicated from the mountain
tops of Afghanistan; nor yet have we had the unforgettable writing many of
us recall during World War Two.<P>

But judging by the standard of reporting already evident, and as long as
editors – and readers – do not tire as the war drags on, then the prospects
are good. We may even begin to see the revival of high quality reporting as
a constant in the popular tabloids as well as the broadsheets; celebrity journalism
and trivia will always find a slot, of course. But what an odd paradox
it would be if Mr Bin Laden’s bequest was to be better journalism all round.<P>
