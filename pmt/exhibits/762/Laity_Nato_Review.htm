                        Macedonia.* After six months on the brink of civil war, 
                        the main political parties had just signed a 
                        controversial political deal, and NATO was deploying 
                        thousands of troops to collect weapons handed over by 
                        fighters of the ethnic Albanian National Liberation Army 
                        (NLA). But at this turning point for the country, 
                        hardliners were using their media domination to launch 
                        massive criticism of NATO and the peace 
                        agreement.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=bodyzw>NATO's fear 
                        was that the hardliners' disinformation campaign could 
                        undermine our ability to do a job that depended on 
                        consent and cooperation rather than force. Success 
                        relied on the willingness of ethnic Albanian fighters 
                        voluntarily to hand over weapons, which was in turn 
                        linked to ethnic Macedonian parliamentarians voting 
                        through radical political changes many disliked. Our 
                        presence was at the request of a deeply divided 
                        government and the impact of the media's reporting on a 
                        fearful ethnic Macedonian public already suspicious of 
                        NATO, and willing to believe the worst, could not be 
                        underestimated. In such circumstances, the media were 
                        key players, and at this stage we were losing the public 
                        relations battle.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=bodyzw>But a 
                        year later the NLA has been disbanded, and the August 
                        2001 Framework Agreement is law. Political violence has 
                        drastically declined, and free and fair elections have 
                        now been successfully completed. Much remains to be 
                        done, but the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia* has 
                        turned a corner. This is, above all, a success for the 
                        people of the country themselves. But the international 
                        community also emerges with much credit. Indeed, 
                        international intervention in the former Yugoslav 
                        Republic of Macedonia* is already being seen as a 
                        classic (and rare) example of successful pre-emptive 
                        diplomacy, and some of that success can be attributed to 
                        the turnaround in the media.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN

                        Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia* became a very different 
                        kind of operation to those in Bosnia and Herzegovina and 
                        Kosovo. Those NATO missions were more narrowly military 
                        and reflected the powerful role of the international 
                        community. In the former Yugoslav Republic of 
                        Macedonia,* NATO's mission was more political while the 
                        Skopje government was proudly sovereign. NATO was and is 
                        a partner to the government, and can only operate with 
                        its full consent.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=bodyzw>The 
                        original NATO media operation was relatively small. It 
                        was responsible for the public relations activities of 
                        the logistical support to KFOR in the former Yugoslav 
                        Republic of Macedonia,* the so-called KFOR Rear, which 
                        had no role within the country itself, but controlled 
                        the transit of KFOR supplies from Greece to Kosovo. As 
                        NATO became more involved in the former Yugoslav 
                        Republic of Macedonia,* the media operation became 
                        increasingly overloaded.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN

                        had been sliding into civil war since the emergence of 
                        the NLA in spring 2001. But it was the appointment that 
                        summer, at the request of the country's president and 
                        prime minister, of a NATO official, Pieter Feith, to 
                        make contact with NLA leader, Ali Ahmeti, which 
                        catapulted NATO into the heart of media controversy. By 
                        that stage, the European Union had brokered a grand 
                        governing coalition of the main ethnic Albanian and 
                        ethnic Macedonian political parties. It was the only way 
                        to get agreement on the painful political changes needed 
                        to avoid civil war, but it also imported into government 
                        many bitter divisions and rivalries.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN 
                        class=bodyzw>That disunity focused on the clash between 
                        hardliners and moderates over handling the fighters of 
                        the NLA. Hardliners wanted a military solution and 
                        regarded the NLA as terrorists to be fought, while 
                        moderates accepted that a political agreement was needed 
                        to meet legitimate ethnic Albanian political aspirations 
                        and take away the reasons for any further conflict. 
                        Western militaries regarded the state security forces as 
                        incapable of winning a guerrilla war, while diplomats 
                        saw a political deal as the only alternative to a civil 
                        war and partition.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=bodyzw>In 
                        such a situation, Mr Feith's contacts with Mr Ahmeti, to 
                        seek a cease-fire and the NLA's disbandment, put him at 
                        the centre of the media storm. His contacts were at the 
                        specific request of the government, but in such a 
                        disunited government that did not protect NATO from 
                        criticism. The hardliners were very public in their 
                        attacks on NATO, but even the ethnic Macedonian 
                        ministers who accepted the necessity of speaking to Mr 
                        Ahmeti found it hard to defend in public, what was for 
                        them, such a distasteful course.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN 
                        class=bodyzw>This was all made worse in June when NATO 
                        organised the withdrawal of NLA fighters from the town 
                        of Aracinovo near Skopje. Military attempts to drive out 
                        the NLA had totally failed, and, as the military and 
                        political situation rapidly deteriorated, NATO and Mr 
                        Feith were asked by the Skopje government to persuade 
                        the NLA to leave. It was a tough and risky task but they 
                        succeeded, although only at the price of a government 
                        crisis and a massive media backlash. The public was told 
                        NATO had saved the NLA from defeat, not defused a 
                        crisis, while hardliners in the government criticised

                        to respond to criticism which often came from elements 
                        within the government that had asked NATO to be there 
                        and do exactly what it was doing. Meanwhile, hardline 
                        media were fanning the flames of ethnic hatred and 
                        whipping up war fever. A European Commission report 
                        concluded: "Media coverage during the 2001 crisis 
                        significantly contributed to worsening the political 
                        situation."</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=bodyzw>Over the 
                        summer, NATO faced regular accusations of active 
                        military cooperation with the NLA, including providing 
                        helicopters to supply and transport them. The official 
                        government spokesman routinely accused NATO officials of 
                        "abusing their trust" and "brutal behaviour" as part of 
                        a deliberate coordinated campaign to cause war. It is a 
                        huge tribute to the courage of many in the Skopje 
                        government that despite the pressure they themselves 
                        were under, they still managed to agree the Framework 
                        Agreement in August. Despite the reservations of their 
                        own public and in the face of such media criticism, they 
                        made many tough decisions.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN

                        limelight. The Feith team's contacts with Mr Ahmeti, 
                        like so much crisis diplomacy, relied on discretion to 
                        succeed, but their self-imposed low profile had made 
                        NATO vulnerable to disinformation. NATO was both 
                        misunderstood and unpopular with much of the ethnic 
                        Macedonian public. The arrival of several thousand NATO 
                        troops produced a wave of media attention and hostility 
                        that swamped the existing public relations team, despite 
                        the excellent work of the existing military spokesman, 
                        Major Barry Johnson.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN

                        visit by the Secretary General to coincide with the

                        the NLA, completed well ahead of schedule. It should 
                        have been a good-news story, but it went wrong. Despite 
                        an overwhelming preponderance of good serviceable 
                        weapons, we managed to put all the dirtiest and oldest

                        press conference at the weapons site descended into 
                        chaos as journalists broke away and mobbed him. Local 
                        media said the process was a sham, and international

                        decision was made to take a far more forceful public 
                        approach to combat the lies and distortions. The most 
                        obvious difference was the appointment of a civilian 
                        spokesman, myself, to answer the highly political 
                        questions and criticisms that a military spokesman could 
                        not.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=bodyzw>For the media it 
                        was a shock. The worst media had interpreted our 
                        reactive and low-key response as a manifestation of 
                        weakness and lack of confidence in our own case, and 
                        polite rejections of outrageous allegations were brushed 
                        aside. Our previous refusal to engage on political 
                        issues had also been seen as weakness by journalists who 
                        did not understand the limitations of what Western 
                        military officers can say. Suddenly, they themselves 
                        were challenged, and because NATO's daily press 
                        conferences were the media highlight of the day, they 
                        had little choice but to report what we said. Every 
                        night the NATO press conference took up huge chunks of 
                        television airtime.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN 
                        class=bodyzw>Much of the analysis was still distorted, 
                        but NATO's messages and agendas were being heard in a 
                        way they had never been heard before, and many of the 
                        worst of the outright fictions disappeared. It was never 
                        easy, but when powerful hardliners started to argue that 
                        NATO should not have daily press conferences, we knew 
                        that our public relations efforts were having the right 
                        effect. Direct confrontation with hardline ministers was 
                        avoided, but the key messages included constant 
                        reminders that our presence was at their request, and 
                        therefore their responsibility.</SPAN><BR><BR></P>

                        filming; and the worst of the dirt was removed from 
                        weapons to show them for what they were — highly 
                        serviceable killing tools, and certainly not 
                        junk.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=bodyzw>Media strategy 
                        was also an integral part of the commander's morning 
                        conference, woven closely into overall policy, and the 
                        media advisers very much felt a valued part of the team. 
                        There was even a second media meeting straight after the 
                        main conference to get the details right, and the force 
                        commanders and senior political representatives took a 
                        direct role in directing the strategy to help the 
                        overall mission.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=bodyzw>At 
                        times, it also produced a conscious linking of 
                        background pressure and diplomacy with public 
                        statements. For instance, pressure to get ethnic 
                        Macedonian hardliners to pull back paramilitary units 
                        that were deliberately provoking firefights was done by 
                        a combination of talking to politicians and taking our 
                        evidence to the media. Here, as elsewhere, it was an 
                        absolute rule never to give out false 
                        information.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=bodyzw>The NATO 
                        media team also found it easier to get information 
                        whenever something happened. Getting good information 
                        fast is fundamental to media success, and often a big 
                        problem in military operations relying on a chain of 
                        command. However, the commanders' clear support for 
                        their media team meant we mostly got what we needed when 
                        we needed it. Our ability to provide accurate, timely 
                        information gave NATO a big advantage in the battle to 
                        get the media's attention.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN 
                        class=h2>International cooperation</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN 
                        class=bodyzw>Cooperation with other international 
                        organisations was also vital. The NATO/EU link was 
                        particularly valuable, and throughout NATO Secretary 
                        General Lord Robertson and EU High Representative Javier 
                        Solana were not just key political brokers but also the 
                        ultimate media heavy artillery, putting over 
                        international policy in a way no one else could, 
                        especially as their visits usually came at the most 
                        critical times. But the Skopje-based political 
                        representatives also increasingly coordinated their 
                        media strategy, and for NATO it was always a high 
                        priority to get other international organisations onto 
                        the platform of the daily press conference. When we 
                        spoke together, it always had more effect, and the 
                        reverse also applied, with the hardliners always looking 
                        for gaps to exploit.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN 
                        class=bodyzw>But the most important requirement for 
                        success was simple, though not easy — credibility. At 
                        the heart of our problems last summer was the fact that 
                        ethnic Macedonians did not believe us. We knew we were 
                        speaking the truth, but we had to persuade sceptical 
                        media that this was the case. The forceful refutation of 
                        others' lies and disinformation had to be followed by 
                        building up a record of accuracy in our information, as 
                        well as gaining acceptance that our strategy was at 
                        least honest and sincere, even if some still disagreed 
                        with it.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=bodyzw>The success of 
                        <EM>Task Force Harvest</EM> helped provide this 
                        credibility. We said the weapons would be collected, and 
                        they were. We said the NLA would disband, and it did. We 
                        said ethnic Macedonian paramilitary units were causing 
                        violence, and when they were withdrawn the incidents 
                        ceased. And after the press conferences were over we 
                        talked individually with journalists, arguing and 
                        briefing over coffee, comparing notes. The problem the 
                        journalists had was that it was hard to know what to 
                        believe, because for months they had been fed a diet of 
                        distortion and conflicting views. Despite this, and 
                        despite the bias of the organisations they worked for, 
                        many wanted to get it right. Others were already 
                        well-informed, but were not allowed to write what they 
                        knew. In such circumstances personal relationships were 
                        vital, learning to trust each other as individuals, even 
                        as friends.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=bodyzw>NATO's 
                        media strategy helped open up the media, and the success 
                        on the ground, actively promoted and explained, built up 
                        NATO's credibility. By the end of <EM>Task Force 
                        Harvest</EM> in October 2001, a core group of 
                        journalists basically trusted NATO, and regarded our 
                        version of events as most reliable. Over the next year 
                        that was increasingly reflected in the output of the 
                        ethnic Macedonian media, which split between moderates 
                        and hardliners as more normal politics reasserted 
                        itself.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=bodyzw>Last year, 
                        media in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia* were 
                        seen as a significant cause of their country's slide 
                        towards civil war. In the successful elections that took 
                        place in September, while some still opted for bias and 
                        lies, large portions of the same media played a truly 
                        constructive role. In spite of threats and intimidation 
                        in some instances, many brave individuals and 
                        publications were determined to be part of the solution, 
                        not part of the problem. It is particularly noteworthy 
                        that some of those who were threatened came to NATO for 
                        help, and we spoke loudly on their behalf. We have 
                        indeed come a long way.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN
