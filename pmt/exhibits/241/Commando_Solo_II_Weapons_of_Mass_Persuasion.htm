width=420>CAMP AS SAYLIYAH, QATAR, March 19, 2003 -- U.S. Special Operations 
personnel armed with broadcasting equipment and “the truth” are preparing the 
Iraqi people and military for a possible U.S.-led strike against Saddam 
Hussein.&nbsp; 
<P class=newsBody>“We call ourselves ‘weapons of mass persuasion,’ ” said Air 
Force Lt. Col. “Mike,” a Commando Solo II detachment commander. U.S. Central 
Command officials said the Commando Solo II effort may have played a role with 
the surrender of 17 Iraqi soldiers earlier today near the border of Kuwait. Jim 
Wilkinson, Central Command’s director of strategic communications, said the 
message appears to be getting through. “Clearly Iraq’s forces are listening to 
the Coalition’s message that it is better to live to see Iraq’s future than to 
die fighting for Saddam Hussein’s oppressive regime.” Special operators fly 
Commando Solo II sorties onboard EC-130E aircraft. Six EC-130s that function as 
‘flying broadcast stations’ are available for the mission, in which 
pre-programmed AM, FM and HF radio messages are pumped in to Iraq.&nbsp; 
<P class=newsBody>Lt. Col. Mike and his associates are reservists that belong to 
the Air Force’s 193rd Special Operations Wing, based in Harrisburg, 
Pennsylvania. The effort is a coordinated campaign between Air Force and Army 
Special Operations members. It’s designed to inform the Iraqi people and 
military that the upcoming war -- if it occurs -- is not directed against them 
personally. “It’s against Saddam Hussein and the way he rules,” Mike said. “We’d 
like the Iraqi military to throw down their arms and not engage our military,” 
if there is a war. <IMG align=right

width=350> One goal of the mission is to figure out how Iraqis think and to 
persuade them that Hussein, ‘who really doesn’t care for them,’ isn’t worth the 
fight, Mike said.&nbsp; 
<P class=newsBody>One radio script describes how Hussein’s son, Uday, paid $1.4 
million to Lebanese singer Nawal Al-Zughby to entertain the Baghdad elite. “The 
regime truly has no regard for the welfare of the Iraqi people,” the script 
reads. “Saddam’s son has made this evident by his callous choices when spending 
Iraq’s money.” Soldiers assigned to the Army’s 4th Psychological Operations 
Group, based at Ft. Bragg, N.C., research the various Iraqi cultures and produce 
segments for the broadcasts. Army Staff Sgt. “Nobel”, a 38 year-old reservist 
from Cleveland, Ohio, works in the production distribution center. His team 
receives radio programs from Ft. Bragg at an undisclosed location inside Central 
Command’s area of responsibility. 
<P class=newsBody>&nbsp;Programs normally last about one hour, Nobel said. Each 
program has an introduction, combinations of regional and Western music and an 
information message designed for the target audience. “We try to keep the music 
and entertainment portion different with each program,” Noble said. Research 
back at Ft. Bragg has shown music by Celine Dion, Sheryl Crow and Santana is 
liked by Iraqis in the target areas, so their songs and others receive regular 
air time. “We don’t want to offend their culture in any way,” Noble said. 
Leaflet drops are separate from Commando Solo missions, and are also used to 
disseminate Commando Solo-type messages.&nbsp;

width=350> Leaflet drops also are used to inform target audiences of the 
“information radio” service and the broadcast frequencies. To date, more than 17 
million leaflets have been dropped this year. Commando Solo pilot Lt. Col. 
“Craig” said in addition to supporting the objectives of the coalition, many 
lives can be saved as a result of Commando Solo broadcasts. “To the Iraqi 
populace (we say) stay out of the way if (a war occurs); to the military units 
(we say) walk away from your weapons, throw up the white flag, surrender,” Craig 
said. In the first Gulf War officials believed the leaflet and Commando Solo 
combination worked well.&nbsp; 
<P class=newsBody>Iraqi soldiers surrendered with leaflets in their hands, arms 
extended above their heads. Craig said those soldiers knew what to do because 
they read the leaflets and listened to the radio broadcasts. “We think we saved 
tens of thousands of lives during the Gulf War,” he said. </P></BODY>
