<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial>This article is the history of psychological 
operations in Afghanistan from the bombing of the New York City World Trade 
Center until the arbitrary date of March 6, 2002. That date was selected simply 
because we had passed the 6000-word mark and it seemed a good place to stop. 
Note that although almost all of these leaflets are shown in full color, in many 
cases they also exist in black and white and on various grades of paper. Poorly 
cut specimens are common. Know also that excellent facsimiles exist and we have 
already seen fake copies of leaflets AFD06, AFD10c and AFD24 offered in the 
marketplace. Let the buyer beware!&nbsp;<STRONG><O:P> </O:P></STRONG></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial>On September 11, 2001, terrorists of the 
al-Qaida (the Base) group, some trained and financed by Saudi Arabian 
exile-in-hiding Osama bin Laden, attacked the World Trade Center in New York 
City and the Pentagon in Washington DC.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial>President Bush immediately demanded that the 
ruling fundamentalist Islamic Taliban movement of Afghanistan turn over Mr. bin 
Laden for trial. President Bush declared a war on terrorism and stated that they 
would be found and attacked regardless of where they were hiding. The operation 
was originally named "Infinite Justice," but was altered when it was discovered 
that Islam reserved infinite judgment for Allah. The name was immediately 
changed to "Enduring Freedom." Political correctness at its 
best.&nbsp;&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial>The bombing of Afghanistan began on October 
7. Along with the bombing, the United States Air Force also dropped food packets 
for the Afghan refugees. Aerial propaganda leaflets were not dropped the first 
week due to high winds. The first leaflet drop took place on October 15, 
coordinated with Coalition radio broadcasts. EC-130-E Command Solo aircraft from 
the 193rd Special Operations Wing flying out of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, 
broadcast to the Afghan people. The modified C-130 can broadcast radio or TV 
signals - AM, FM and HF. It broadcasts across the band from 45 kilohertz to 1000 
megahertz.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial>On October 15th the United States government 
released illustrations of the first two leaflets dropped on Afghanistan. It 
reported that a single B-52 Stratofortress bomber had dropped 385,000 leaflets 
over the eastern town of Ghazni, the northwestern town of Sheberghan, and 
between Sheberghan and the western city of Herat.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial>The first leaflet depicts an American 
soldier shaking hands with an Afghan citizen. The photograph is in full color, 
the text in bright blue. The leaflet was written in Pashto (spoken by the Afghan 
ethnic majority Pashtun) and Dari (a Persian dialect spoken by the minority 
Tajiks). The leaflet states on the front, "The partnership of nations is here to 
help." The back of the leaflets says, "The partnership of nations is here to 
assist the people of Afghanistan." The leaflet is coded AFD10c.</FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial>This second leaflet tells the Afghan finder 
what radio stations to dial in order to hear the latest news from the coalition 
forces. Part of the PSYOP plan was to tell the Afghan people why their country 
was being bombed. The radio broadcasts stress that this is simply a war against 
terrorism and not against the people of Afghanistan. The Taliban's main Kabul 
radio station, Voice of Sharia, was taken off the air by an American cruise 
missile several days earlier.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial>The New York Times stated that a leaflet 
with a similar message had been dropped to explain to the Afghan people why they 
were being bombed. The leaflet said, "On September 11th, the United States was 
the target of terrorist attacks, leaving no choice but to seek justice for these 
horrible crimes."</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial>Two days later a report stated that leaflets 
had been dropped showing pictures of food parcels and explaining how the 
contents sh<FONT face=Arial color=#ffffff>ould be consumed. For instance, there 
is a drawing showing how a tube of peanut butter should be 
squeezed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial color=#ffffff>On October 17 it was reported 
that small&nbsp;battery-powered portable radios were dropped to those without 
radios or electricity. It is believed that the Americans dropped the WR-004 
"World Receiver" AM, FM and short wave radio produced by the STL Group in the 
Netherlands under the brand name "Super Tech." They were&nbsp;dropped with the 
batteries already in the radio. The British apparently 
dropped&nbsp;crank-powered Radios at the same time. Broadcasts that same day 
told the people where to find the yellow cartons containing food dropped by 
American aircraft. </FONT><FONT size=4><SPAN 
style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'"><O:P></O:P></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial>On October 18 the U.S. Government released 
several radio broadcast texts to the public. Some of the messages were as 
follows, "Attention Taliban! You are condemned. Did you know that? The instant 
the terrorists you support took over our planes, you sentenced yourselves to 
death...our helicopters will rain death down upon your camps before you detect 
them on your radar. Our bombs are so accurate we can drop them through your 
windows...you have only one choice, surrender now and we will give you a second 
chance. We will let you live." In order to entice the Afghans to listen to the 
radio, about three-quarters of all broadcasts consist of music. The Taliban had 
condemned music.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial>On the same day the American Forces 
Information Service reported two leaflet drops over northeastern Afghanistan 
exhorting the people to abandon, or to fight the Taliban and al-Qaida 
forces.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial>The leaflet image has not yet been released 
yet but is believed to read, "Do you enjoy being ruled by the Taliban? Are you 
proud to live a life of fear? Are you happy to see the place your family has 
owned for generations a terrorist training site?"</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial>On October 19 the U.S. Government broadcast 
warnings of an impending ground attack, "Attention! People of Afghanistan. 
United States forces will be moving through your area. We are here for Osama bin 
Laden, al-Qaida, and those who protect them. Please, for your own safety, stay 
off bridges and roadways and do not interfere with our troops or military 
operations. If you do this you will not be harmed."</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial>At the same time it was reported that 
leaflets were also dropped over the Taliban stronghold of Kandahar. The leaflets 
warned the people to avoid potential military targets and stay in their 
homes.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial>The leaflet image has not yet been released 
yet, but the text may read, "We have no wish to hurt you, the innocent people of 
Afghanistan. Stay away from military installations, government buildings, 
terrorist camps, roads factories or bridges. If you are near these places, then 
you must move away from them. Seek a safe place, and stay well away from 
anything that might be a target."</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>One day later on October 20, two hundred elite American 
Rangers and four PSYOP soldiers attacked a Taliban controlled fortress in 
Kandahar. This attack was entirely psychological because the only target in the 
town was the home of the Taliban spiritual leader, Mullah Omar. It was a warning 
that America could strike when and where it chooses, even at the center of the 
Taliban spiritual strength. The American troops left 2 million leaflets 
featuring a photograph of New York City firemen raising the flag over the ruins 
of the World Trade Center with the text "Freedom Endures."</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial>The Sunday Times of October 21 stated that 
what appeared to be genuine 100-afghanis banknotes had been overprinted and 
airdropped with the message "Our goals will be achieved, if not willingly, then 
by overwhelming force."</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial>On October 23 the Taliban showed that the 
leaflets and radio messages were having a result. A senior militia official 
announced from Kabul that the Afghan people in the eastern city of Jalalabad 
were burning the propaganda leaflets and radios being dropped by U.S. planes to 
turn the population against the Taliban. The leaflets were also reportedly 
dropped on the western neighborhoods of Kabul. Some Afghans said that they were 
afraid to pick up the leaflets and risk punishment by the Taliban.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial>The leaflet dropped on Jalalabad shows 
al-Qaida terrorists at the left and right targeted by a sniper's crosshairs in 
red. Text at the center in Pashto and Dari read, "Drive out the foreign 
terrorists." The Taliban is made up of non-Afghans, particularly Pakistanis. It 
is believed that the Afghans fear and dislike them, and thus the leaflet tries 
to drive a wedge between the two groups.</FONT></P>

AFD24.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial>On October 29 the U.S. Government released 
another leaflet image. This leaflet had four cartoons in full color. The first 
shows an American aircraft dropping humanitarian daily rations (HDR) food 
packets. The second shows an Afghan picking up one of the packets. When turned 
over, the leaflet shows the Afghan tearing open the packet. The word "Halal" is 
at the upper right. This term shows that the food was prepared in accordance 
with the Koran. The final illustration shows the Afghan sitting with his entire 
family and enjoying the feast sent by the Americans. The leaflet is clearly 
designed for illiterate Afghans and shows them what to do with the yellow 
packets found on the ground. This leaflet does not show a code, but it is known 
to be AFD16g.<STRONG><O:P> </O:P></STRONG></FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial>On November 2 the Pentagon announced that 
they had dropped a new aerial propaganda leaflet. The oversized leaflet depicted 
three photographs of the head of Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar targeted by 
the crosshairs of a gun scope at the far right. The Mullah had earlier forbidden 
any photographs of himself. To the left of the photographs were three 
photographs of the license plate of one of Omar's vehicles, again covered by the 
crosshairs. This second photo was probably taken during an earlier operation 
when an American Predator unmanned surveillance aircraft fitted with two 
"Hellfire" anti-tank missiles had targeted the car but was not allowed to fire 
due to a rules of engagement dispute. To the left are three pairs of eyes 
alternated with the text "We are watching!" The leaflet is identical on both 
sides except for the text, which is in Pashto or Dari. The Pentagon announced 
that 16 million leaflets have been produced and would be dropped in batches at 
intervals.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial>On the same day, the Pentagon stated that leaflets had been 
dropped warning the Afghans not to pick up the yellow cluster bombs that were 
similar in color to the HDR food packets. Human rights groups had criticized the 
use of the cluster bombs because it was thought that children might be attracted 
to the bright yellow color. The Pentagon reported that the color of the 
humanitarian Daily Rations would be blue in the future.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The warning leaflet is AFD39. The leaflet depicts a hand 
reaching toward a food packet on one side and a short message explaining that 
this is safe. The back of the leaflet depicts a hand reaching for a bomblet, and 
shows bomblets in several forms on the ground. There is a skull and crossed 
bones at the center of the leaflet warning finders of the danger. On November 8, 
the Pentagon announced that 16 million propaganda leaflets had been dropped on 
Afghanistan. The previous day the 4th PSYOP Group at Ft. Bragg had printed 
800,000 new leaflets and packed them inside 15 propaganda bombs to be shipped to 
Afghanistan. The PSYOP troops were placed on a war footing at the start of the 
operation and regularly worked 12-hour shifts, 24 hours a day.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial>On November 8 the Pentagon announced that 16 
million propaganda leaflets had already been dropped on Afghanistan. The

Afghanistan.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial>The Taliban showed signs of sudden collapse 
on November 14. They had threatened to fight to the death, but they surprised 
everyone by fleeing the Afghan capital of Kabul in the dark of the night. The 
war now entered a new phase as American Special Forces hunted bin Laden and his 
terrorist group in the mountains and caves of southeastern Afghanistan. They set 
up roadblocks along the refugee-filled roads. That same day the United States 
broadcast radio messages and dropped 1.5 million leaflets offering 25 million 
dollars to anyone willing to betray bin Laden.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial>The front of the leaflet pictured Aiman 
al-Zawahiri at the left and Osama bin Laden at the right. Al-Zawahiri is an 
Egyptian doctor turned militant, leader of Jamaat-ul-Jihad, and suspect in the 
bombing of two U.S. Embassies in East Africa that killed over 220 people. He is 
considered a top aide to bin Laden. The text "Up to <U>$25,000,000</U> reward" 
is at the center of the leaflet between the photographs. The back of the 
leaflets has the same text in Pashto and Dari at left and right that reads, "Up 
to $25,000,000 reward for information leading to the whereabouts or capture of 
these two men." Osama bin laden is shown at the top center, and Aiman 
al-Zawahiri at bottom center.</FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial>On November 20 The United States Central 
Command (Centcom) released another leaflet to the public. This leaflet showed 
the strength of the Partnership forces and threatened the Taliban with death if 
they did not flee. The leaflet has four drawn illustrations, two on each side. 
On the front an armed Taliban truck is shown. The second picture shows a large 
bomb under a parachute dropping on three of the vehicles. This is certainly the 
BLU-82, the Volkswagen-sized bomb that is dropped from the back of a C-130 
aircraft. Text at the bottom states, "Taliban: we know where you are." The 
pictures on the back show an large burning crater. Two Taliban soldiers,

<P><FONT face=Arial>No further leaflets were released to the public until 
December&nbsp;8. That day three leaflets were partially illustrated in an 
article published in the London<EM> Daily Telegraph.&nbsp;</EM>The article was 
entitled "Hippy who Waged War with Music and Posters," and was written by Toby 
Harnden.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The first leaflet shows four members of al-Qaida or the 
Taliban. The&nbsp;individual at the far left is identified as "Muttawakil," and 
is believed to represent the Taliban Foreign Minister Mullah Abdul Wakil 
Muttawakil. The next figure is&nbsp;Osama bin Laden. The third figure is 
identified as "Haggani," and would appear to be Jalaluddin Haggani, a senior 
Taliban commander who was quoted as saying "We are eagerly awaiting the American 
troops to land on our soil, where we will deal with them in our own way." The 
fourth individual wears the black Taliban turban, but is otherwise unidentified. 
Three Afghans are seen hanging from a gallows in the background. The text on the 
leaflet is "The Taliban reign of fear..." At the left and right of the leaflet 
we can just make out the fearful face of a snarling Jinn. The Koran identifies 
the jinn as creatures created from a smokeless fire. They lie and practice 
deceit to fulfill their own desire for evil. Showing them with the Taliban 
implies that the leaders&nbsp;have been deceived and turned toward evil by the 
supernatural creatures.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>When turned over, the back of the leaflet shows&nbsp;the 
four&nbsp;faces&nbsp;altered slightly to resemble skulls, an American bit of 
trickery that was practiced&nbsp;during&nbsp;WWII when Adolf Hitler's face was 
changed to a&nbsp;skull-like countenance&nbsp;in an attempt to say that he 
represented death. In place of the gallows an explosion is shown with debris 
thrown into the air. The text goes on to say "...is about to end!" This leaflet 
is coded AFD56b.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial>A final item is mentioned but not shown. The&nbsp;article 
states that Ft. Bragg had printed&nbsp;a "greeting card" 
type&nbsp;leaflet&nbsp;depicting a date palm and a bowl of&nbsp;dates - a 
traditional food for celebrating the end&nbsp;of Eid al-Fitr, the month-long 
fasting period&nbsp;of Ramadan. The text is "People of Afghanistan -&nbsp;Eid 
Mabaruk - We wish that God will accept your prayers and fast. People of 
America."&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worth noting that the American translation misspells 
one Arabic word which should be "Mubarak." The translation of "Eid Mubarak" is 
"Have a blessed holiday." The leaflet illustration was finally released to the 
public by the Pentagon in February of 2002. At that time it was also reported 
that California dates had been dropped along with the leaflets. Dates are a 
fruit that the Muslims traditionally use to break the fast of Ramadan. By 
including dates in the air drop bundles, the United States showed respect for 
this significant Muslim holiday. The leaflet code number is AFD89.</FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal align=left><FONT face=Arial>The leaflets can be broken done

pain of your death." These illustrations of dead or mangled fighters

over, a&nbsp;vicious battle erupted once again in early March of 2002. A group

Afghanistan meant betrayal of the cause of Islam.&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></P>
