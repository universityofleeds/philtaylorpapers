              on coverage of the Chechen war with <I>Moskovsky Komsomolets'</I> 
              Julia Kalinina </A>
              <P><BR><A name=1></A><B>Anchor Maria Slonim:</B> Initially 
              <I>Fourth Estate</I> should have aired on the Russian state 
              channel RTR. But the first, or more exactly, the zero edition of 
              the show was cut because of a piece on the information war in 
              Chechnya which the Russian side lost. The first Chechen war had 
              only recently come to an end, so it was still was a sore spot. Now 
              the Russian authorities recognize that the first Chechen war was 
              lost on all fronts. Today they are trying to make up for what was 
              lost then. We decided to draw an analogy between what happened on 
              the fronts of the information war then, five years ago, and now. 
              Tatyana Koroleva tells the story: 
              <P><B>Koroleva:</B> It happened five years ago. Today we know that 
              it was the first Chechen war. Today we know that after the first 
              one would be the second Chechen war. And nobody knows when it will 
              end. We know about the present war from official reports. We 
              learned about the first war from journalists. 
              <P><B>Valery Yakov, deputy editor-in-chief of the newspaper 
              <I>Novie Izvestia: </I></B>
              <P>Then journalists had the opportunity to tell the truth about 
              events in Chechnya. Then we didn't have to believe the official 
              propaganda, didn't have to believe the Chechen propaganda - we 
              could see what really happened with our own eyes. 
              <P><B>Vladimir Luskanov, NTV news analyst:</B> 
              <P>There was a very short period of victory of the freedom of the 
              press in this country. And if we were able to do something for 
              that victory, I'm proud. 
              <P><B>Koroleva:</B> While generals boasted that our army was fully 
              prepared, journalists told about hungry, poorly-equipped soldiers. 
              While the Defense Ministry alleged that our soldiers were like 
              superheroes, the television showed that they were 18 year-olds who 
              knew about war only through children games. 
              <P><B>Igor Malashenko, first deputy chairman of the board of 
              directors of Media Most </B>
              <P>The media made obvious all of the miscalculations, stupidity, 
              and even crimes committed in Chechnya. 
              <P><B>Koroleva:</B> That war had its rules, but there was no 
              censorship. Freedom of the press totally smashed the official 
              propaganda. 
              <P><B>Malashenko:</B> There was no censorship as such during the 
              first Chechen war. There were only some attempts to put pressure 
              on the press. 
              <P><B>Koroleva:</B> The private Russian television station NTV 
              nearly lost its broadcasting license over its unflattering 
              coverage of the Chechen war. Russian journalists told the public 
              that Chechens were not only bearded fighters with green headbands, 
              but also that the main victims of the bombardments were children, 
              women, and old people. 
              <P><B>Malashenko:</B> During the first Chechen war Russian 
              journalists had the opportunity to show both sides of the 
              conflict. 
              <P><B>Koroleva:</B> The one side was the federal forces. The other 
              side was the army of Dzhokhar Dudaev. Today we call Basaev and 
              Raduev terrorists and gang leaders of bandits. During the first 
              Chechen war they were called the field-commanders. Journalists 
              interviewed them, attended their news conferences. And sometimes, 
              let's be honest, Russian journalists romanticized their images. 
              <P><B>Luskanov:</B> Chechen field-commanders no longer have the 
              trust of journalists that they enjoyed during the first war. Now 
              they have completely lost our trust. 
              <P><B>Koroleva:</B> In order for the public to know the truth 
              about the war, journalists have to provide balanced coverage. 
              Balanced coverage cannot be one-sided. During the first Chechen 
              war this was the general belief among journalists. That is why 
              they went to gather material from the Chechen side. 
              <P><B>Malashenko:</B> In the beginning, Chechen leaders were smart 
              enough to ensure normal working conditions for Russian journalists 
              on their side of the frontline. 
              <P><B>Koroleva:</B> Journalists died in that war. Sometimes it was 
              easier to die than to stay alive. Journalists became goods for 
              trading or selling in that war. This is, without a doubt, the 
              know- how of the first Chechen war. 
              <P><B>Luskanov:</B> It's not our fault. It's the fault of the 
              people who are responsible for the genocide of 1996-1998, the 
              genocide of journalists. 
              <P><B>Koroleva:</B> In the modern world, information has a high 
              price. In modern Russia, the price for information is too high. It 
              is more expensive than money. 
              <P><B>Luskanov:</B> Because of the great danger to reporters, 
              because of the inhuman conditions under which they have to work - 
              all of these taken together are not worth even a single second of 
              an interview with Basaev or even with Allah himself. 
              <P><BR><A name=2></A><B>Anchor Maria Slonim:</B> The 
              newly-appointed information coordinator of the Russian-Chechen 
              campaign, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, asserted that censorship on 
              coverage of the Chechen war would not be introduced. However, 
              information from the federal side is strictly restricted. 
              Journalists on the federal side have to work under the strict 
              control of the Defense Ministry and the Interior Ministry, and we 
              are not getting the full picture. 
              <P><B>Fourth Estate Correspondent Yevgeny Krasnolobov:</B> The 
              federal forces began yet another storm of Grozny this week, and 
              even military personnel admit that there is heavy fighting on the 
              outskirts of the city. Meanwhile, official statistics still report 
              no more than 3-5 Russian soldier casualties per day. More and more 
              frequently, journalists are beginning to doubt this information. 
              The heroic image in the Russian media of the army decisively 
              attacking, expertly avenging Chechen Islamic terrorists, is 
              gradually giving way to another more dreary picture. Articles 
              about hungry soldiers, about the marauding and looting by the 
              Russian forces, and articles accusing the military command of 
              understating casualty figures have even begun appearing in 
              publications usually loyal to the Kremlin. 
              <P>But nevertheless, official channels assert that no one is 
              trying to conceal information about Chechnya that would be 
              unflattering to the authorities. 
              <P><B>Mikhail Margelov, head of the Russian Information Center 
              (Rosinformtsentr)</B> 
              <P>It doesn't make sense to conceal losses because the truth will 
              come out anyway; it will come out later and any attempts to hide 
              it will hit more painfully the prestige of politicians, the 
              prestige of the army and security bodies. 
              <P><B>Krasnolobov:</B> Margelov says that the rumors concerning 
              low casualty figures are being spread by the TV channels NTV and 
              TV Center. These channels, according to Margelov, began an 
              information war against Putin in this presidential election 
              campaign period. However, NTV denies that it is using the topic of 
              Chechnya to discredit the acting president. 
              <P><B>Vladimir Kulistikov, editor-in-chief of the NTV news 
              department </B>
              <P>We are trying to give our viewers the full picture of what is 
              happening in Chechnya. But, unfortunately, the official sources 
              cannot always give us the full picture. That's why we have to use 
              other sources. 
              <P><B>Krasnolobov:</B> According to Kulistikov, this explains 
              NTV's decision to show the tape shot in Grozny by Radio Liberty 
              reporter Andrei Babitsky. This caused the Russian government's 
              Information Center to react angrily. The Center can accept the 
              fact that mass media doubts official information and figures. But 
              it considers journalists who make contact with the rebels to be 
              accomplices of terrorists. 
              <P><B>Margelov:</B> In principle, any journalist who has spent 
              time on the territory taken over by the terrorists should be 
              interrogated by security organs. I should also mention that 
              Russian authorities are demonstrating a kind of superliberalism, 
              because not one of the foreign corespondents, not one of the 
              Russian freelancers working for western mass media has been 
              interrogated. 
              <P><B>Krasnolobov:</B> We met Andrei Babitsky in the summer, when 
              Basaev's fighters had just arrived in Dagestan. Now it is 
              absolutely impossible to catch him at the Moscow office of Radio 
              Liberty - from the very beginning of the Chechen campaign he has 
              been working constantly on the Chechen side of the frontline. 
              However, his colleagues vehemently deny the assertion of the 
              Russian Information Center that Babitsky is spreading false 
              information. 
              <P><B>Vladimir Baburin, editor-in-chief of the Moscow office of 
              Radio Liberty</B> 
              <P>There have been no instances, and I know Andrei since the last 
              war, of his ever giving unverified information. If he says he 
              counted ten corpses, it doesn't mean there were ten dead bodies, 
              there could be many more dead. It means he personally saw at least 
              ten corpses. 
              <P><B>Krasnolobov:</B> It seems that today Babitsky is the only 
              reporter remaining in Grozny. And although not only the 
              authorities, but even some journalist colleagues accuse the Radio 
              Liberty correspondent of a lack of patriotism, no one has yet been 
              able to refute his reports from Chechnya. Thanks to Babitsky the 
              world is able to find out what is going on today under the shroud 
              of fog and smoke in the besieged Chechen capital. 
              <P><BR><A name=3></A><B>Anchor Maria Slonim:</B> Today, in our 
              weekly studio interview, we will continue the topic of press 
              coverage of Chechnya in our conversation with Julia Kalinina of 
              the newspaper <I>Moskovsky Komsomolets.</I> 
              <P><B>Slonim:</B> Julia, you covered the first Chechen war and now 
              you write about coverage of the second war. What is your 
              impression? Because, it seems to us, I mean to people who only 
              read about this war and watch it on TV, that something has changed 
              even in the journalists' approach to this war. 
              <P><B>Kalinina:</B> I don't think so. I think the journalists' 
              approach is the same. I think the way it is covered in the Russian 
              media has changed. Now we see only the Russian side. We don't see 
              the other side. And to be honest, I think that's bad. Personally, 
              I would like to see the whole picture, even if it's really 
              terrible. I believe a person should have complete information in 
              order to make the right decision. But the official approach is a 
              bit different. 
              <P><B>Slonim:</B> But now I think something is changing. Every day 
              the papers give more and more information on what is really going 
              on in Chechnya. And it seems that the federal side doesn't like 
              it. Because if people get the truth about the war, it won't look 
              so heroic. 
              <P><B>Kalinina:</B> I think this is the main reason we see such 
              restricted coverage of the war in the Russian media. Because, even 
              if you cover the war from the federal side, you can still find 
              enough evidence showing that the military operation is not going 
              as smoothly as they say. But journalists have to work in 
              conditions where they simply cannot give any negative information. 
              You have to work with the military; you depend on them. Only the 
              Russian military can get to the frontline. Only they can show you 
              what you want to see. And if you report in a way that they don't 
              like, they simply won't take you next time. By the way this is now 
              the big problem for NTV. I know they are always refused from 
              getting on military helicopters. Officers just won't give them 
              interviews. They say: "NTV -no. ORT is O.K. But NTV - no." 
              <P><B>Slonim:</B> Right. But we get information from the other 
              side anyway. Mainly it doesn't even come from journalists; there 
              are only few journalists, like Andrei Babitsky from Radio Liberty, 
              working there. The information mostly comes from Chechen 
              propaganda. 
              <P><B>Kalinina:</B> As for Chechen propaganda, thanks to my 
              experience working during the previous war, (and the people who 
              are working there are the same), I can sift out what they say. But 
              we shouldn't trust their propaganda. That's why I appreciate 
              Andrei Babitsky's work so much. At least he is trying to getting 
              some of the truth to us. 
              <P><B>Slonim:</B> How long will this situation keep up? I mean 
              from the journalists' point of view. How long will they be able to 
              conceal what is really going on in Chechnya? 
              <P><B>Kalinina:</B> Actually, I don't think it depends on 
              journalists. It is not in their control. Sure many want to say and 
              show much more than they do now. Other mechanisms are at work 
              here. There are mechanisms of control over journalists. And not 
              even over journalists but over editors and the editorial desks of 
              newspapers and TV channels. The truth won't get through the way it 
              should - when journalists just say: "I'm fed up. I'll tell what I 
              see." This will never happen.
