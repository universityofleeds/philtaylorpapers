            href="http://www.state.gov/">http://www.state.gov/</A></U>: "The 
            Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, 
            <U>Charlotte Beers</U>, helps ensure that public diplomacy 
            (engaging, informing, and influencing key international audiences) 
            is practiced in harmony with public affairs (outreach to Americans) 
            and traditional diplomacy to advance U.S. interests and security and 
            to provide the moral basis for U.S. leadership in the world." The 
            State Department homepage contains information on individual public 
            diplomacy programs. It is not within the scope of this paper to 
            examine the relationship of public diplomacy with, respectively, 
            public affairs and traditional diplomacy; suffice it to say that, 
            together with the tensions that exist within public diplomacy (see 
            below), there are also tensions among these three activities. Even 
            today, for example, when the importance of world public opinion is 
            widely acknowledged, traditionally-minded diplomats, like their 
            European brethren at the Versailles peace negotiations nearly one 
            hundred years ago, cannot fully understand how diplomacy, in order 
            to be effective, can in any sense ever be "public" (as Woodrow 
            Wilson demanded). In the traditionalists&#8217; view, diplomacy should be 
            carried out quietly by individuals behind closed doors, in 
            confidence, as a process of<I> negotiation</I>; public diplomacy, in 
            contrast, focuses on <I>information</I>, <I>education</I>, and (for 
            lack of a better word) <I>delectation, </I>and deals openly with 
            often large publics. As for public diplomacy and public affairs, a 
            key tension between them is whether a message addressed to a 
            domestic public should be identical to one directed to a foreign 
            audience.</FONT></P>

            The word "fuzzy" to describe public diplomacy is used by Frank 
            Ninkovich, <I>U.S. Information Policy and Cultural Diplomacy 
            </I>(New York, NY, 1996), 3.</FONT></P>

            American Style of Propaganda (1952-1977)," <I>Fletcher Forum</I>, 8 
            (Summer 1984), 358, where Roth notes that public diplomacy as 
            originally used by Gullion referred to "non-governmental, private 
            sector and direct people-to-people programs as well." It was 
            officially adopted by the United States government to describe its 
            own programs dealing with foreign public opinion in the 1970s. (<A

            "public diplomacy" was once uniquely American, but it has now been 
            adopted in a number of countries. As an example of its use in

            See Walter L. Hixson, <I>Parting the Curtain: Propaganda, Culture 
            and the Cold War.</I> (New York, 1977). On the CIA&#8217;s support of 
            American culture abroad during the early Cold War, see Eva 
            Cockcroft, "Abstract Expressionism: Weapon of the Cold War,"

            War: The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters</I> (New York, 1999). 
            Saunders&#8217;s book has been criticized for its approach, conclusions, 
            and handling of facts but, as a work of journalism, it does contain 
            interesting nuggets of information (regrettably not always 
            reliable), including an observation attributed to George Kennan 
            about the CIA&#8217;s covert funding of cultural activities abroad: "I 
            never felt the slightest pangs of conscience about it. This country 
            has no Ministry of Culture, and CIA was obliged to do what it could 
            to try to fill this gap. It should be praised for having done so, 
            not criticized" (408). See, as an example of the drawbacks found in 
            Saunders&#8217;s book, Walter Laqueur&#8217;s review, "You Had To Be There," 
            <I>The National Interest</I>, no. 58 (Winter 1999/2000), 133-35. A 
            fascinating account of the State Department&#8217;s problems with Congress 
            on displaying modern American art abroad is in Frank Ninkovich, "The 
            Currents of Cultural Diplomacy: Art and the State Department, 
            1938-1947," <I>Diplomatic History</I>, 1, no. 3 (Summer 1977),

            I am drawing on the language of Wallace Carroll, who worked for the 
            OWI during World War II: "&#8216;Information&#8217; was the free communication 
            of facts, favorable or unfavorable, with no undue effort to sway the 
            judgment of the audience. &#8216;Propaganda&#8217; was the communication of 
            selected facts with the aim of leaving a definite impression and 
            possibly inducing action" (Wallace Carroll, <I>Persuade or Perish 
            </I>[Boston, 1948], 235.) I found the following especially useful in 
            defining propaganda: Lindley Fraser, <I>Propaganda </I>(London and 
            New York, 1957); Harold D. Laswell, "Propaganda," <I>Encyclopedia of 
            the Social Sciences </I>(New York, 1937)<I>, </I>vol. 11, 521-528; 
            Daniel Lerner, <I>Psychological Warfare Against Nazi Germany; the 
            Sykewar Campaign, D-Day to VE-Day</I> (Cambridge, Mass., 1971) 
            [reprint of the 1949 edition]; Terence H. Qualter, <I>Opinion 
            Control in the Democracies</I> (New York, 1985), 107-144 ; Philip M. 
            Taylor, Foreword to the <I>Encyclopedia of Propaganda </I>(New York, 
            1998), xv-xix. Fraser&#8217;s little book, published 45 years ago, is 
            still a very enlightening guide on the use of propaganda. Whether 
            propaganda is, in the words of Laswell, (<I>op. cit.</I>, 525) "as a 
            mere tool no more moral or immoral than a pump handle" or "as such, 
            morally neutral" (Fraser <I>op. cit</I>., 12) is a subject about 
            which there has been much debate. For the view that propaganda is 
            "deceitful communication," see Ted J. Smith III, "Propaganda and the

            Compare Fraser&#8217;s view (<I>Facts to a Candid World</I>, 13): "the 
            serious student of propaganda, however much he hopes that lies will 
            never pay in the propaganda world, and however much he welcomes it 
            when the facts seem to conform to his beliefs, must yet be prepared 
            to find cases, both trivial and important, which represent triumph 
            of lying over truth." Here, however, Fraser is being truthful (more, 
            he is telling the truth): propaganda can, on occasion, lie, and can 
            "get away" with it, at least temporarily. But the ultimate 
            consequences of lying</FONT><FONT

            The first director of the State Department&#8217;s Office of Cultural 
            Relations, Ben M. Cherrington, echoed this view with the following 
            observation: "We do not establish strong ties with others by 
            exchanging culture in general, but rather by sharing some interest 
            or activity which has rich meaning for each of us. Here we have the 
            clue as to the method we must employ in &#8230; intellectual co-operation 
            between ourselves and our neighbors" (Espinosa, 140). A memorandum 
            published by the Bureau of the Budget in 1951 stated the following: 
            "Culture for culture&#8217;s sake has no place in the US information and 
            Educational Exchange Program. The value of international cultural 
            interchange is to win respect for the cultural achievements of our 
            free society, where that respect is necessary to inspire cooperation 
            with us in world affairs. In such a situation, cultural activities 
            are an indispensable tool of propaganda." Cited in Thomson and

      American opinion-makers in government and the media now agree that they

      the tensions that arise within and among the public diplomacy functions of 
      information, education, and culture do not necessarily jeopardize its 
      effectiveness in advancing America&#8217;s agenda abroad. Thanks to its

      exchanges were established with Latin America as part of FDR&#8217;s "Good 
      Neighbor" policy and to offset Nazi and fascist influence in the region. 
      The Department of State&#8217;s Division of Cultural Relations (later known as 
      CU) was established in 1938 to handle these programs, which within a few 
      years expanded to other geographical areas. After World War II, the 
      Fulbright Act (1946) and the Smith-Mundt Act (1948) laid the basis for

      me note an example of my own work as cultural affairs officer in Moscow, 
      Russia, where I served in 1998-2001 at the United States embassy. In a 
      country where the United States government is often criticized by the 
      local <I>intelligentsia</I> for doing nothing in the field of culture 
      (especially in contrast to European countries and Japan), one of the most 
      important events that our embassy organized with its Russian partner, the 
      prestigious Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, was a Department of 
      State-sponsored exhibit from the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh that opened 
      in central <A href="http://www.gif.ru/warhol/index_eng.htm">Moscow last 
      year</A>. An all-too-rare example of a U.S. government-funded cultural 
      presentation abroad, this exhibit on a major twentieth-century American 
      cultural figure managed to inform, educate, and delight, in the best sense 
      of the words that characterize the aims of public diplomacy. First, by 
      being the subject of extensive and positive media coverage, the exhibit 
      provided information, both factual and persuasive, that challenged the 
      views of skeptics who believe that America&#8217;s consumerism prevents it from 
      developing serious art. One of the more striking items to appear in the 
      media about the exhibit was a photograph in the influential daily, 
      <I>Kommersant</I>, of a poster of Warhol&#8217;s self-portrait juxtaposed with a 
      bust of the icon of Russian high culture, the poet Alexander Pushkin. 
      Second, to the many Russians still unfamiliar with the United States, the 
      exhibit provided enlightenment about the origins and influence of American 
      pop art and generally about the United States in the 60s and 70s. At a 
      time when Russia is struggling with the concept of the commercialization 
      of high art, the American experience in this field was a valuable point of 
      reference. Working with Russian NGOs, the Embassy cooperated with the 
      United States government-funded American Center in organizing a "Warhol 
      Week in Moscow,"<A name=text28></A></FONT><FONT color=#cc3300

      face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size=3>What results can be expected 
      from public diplomacy? Because it is in essence a human activity, its 
      effectiveness cannot be neatly quantified, although statistics and raw 
      data can be offered to substantiate what it has accomplished, such as how 
      many pro-American articles appeared in overseas media, how many foreign 
      grantees became influential members of their government, or how many 
      favorable responses were obtained from visitors to an art exhibit. Public 
      diplomacy&#8217;s achievements, however, also lie in two broader areas: keeping 
      lines of communication between the United States and other countries open, 
      and depicting America in all its complexity.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size=3>By maintaining an 
      on-going international dialogue, public diplomacy assures continued 
      linkages between the United States and other countries, even when 
      government-to-government relations are disrupted. Public diplomacy thus 
      not only helps traditional diplomacy succeed by creating opportunities for 
      person-to-person contacts that can lead to better official ties, but it 
      also makes up for the failures of traditional diplomacy by allowing human 
      interaction to continue when formal negotiations are suspended or 
      terminated. Alumni associations of public diplomacy program participants 
      are especially important in creating networks that solidify and extend 
      personal, non-official contacts among persons interested in the United 
      States. Public diplomacy creates complex, multi-dimensional, long-lasting 
      impressions and memories about the United States that offset the 
      simplified images promulgated about it abroad. The subtleties and nuances 
      that public diplomacy presents about America provide a fuller, richer 
      picture than that given by persons who know little about the United States 
      or wish to demonize it for narrow political purposes. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size=3>In a globalized world 
      where non-state actors are playing an increasingly important role, it 
      would be ill-conceived to assume that overseas programs in information, 
      education, and culture sponsored by the United States government are a 
      waste of taxpayers&#8217; money because the private sector can do the job of 
      telling America&#8217;s story overseas. American business organizations, 
      including the media and Hollywood, certainly have every right to present 
      America to the world as they as they wish and as its suits their purposes. 
      But the United States is a country, not a product, a news event or a 
      movie, and its government and people need to explain themselves abroad in 
      an in-depth manner to maintain and expand their influence in the 
      international arena. Even with global communications and 
      "Americanization," other nations will continue to have their distinct 
      cultures and ways of looking at reality; for our own national survival in 
      an age of terror, we cannot afford to think that others will eventually 
      become "like us" to the point where there is no need to persuade or 
      communicate with them through public diplomacy. </FONT></P>
