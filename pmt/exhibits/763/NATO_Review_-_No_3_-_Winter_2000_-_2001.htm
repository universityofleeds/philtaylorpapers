      <P>The demonstrators in Serbia called it the “Bastille”. For 13 years, the 
      headquarters of the state broadcaster was a hated symbol of the 
      authoritarian rule of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. When 
      demonstrators stormed Radio-Television Serbia, it signalled the end of 
      Milosevic’s regime. When he could not persuade the army or the police to 
      defend his television monopoly, his dictatorship was over. The citadel had 
      fallen. 
      <P>Radio-Television Serbia (RTS) was Milosevic’s most powerful tool, an 
      electronic truncheon that could stifle dissent and manufacture consent for 
      warfare. Serbia remains a long way from securing democracy and the rule of 
      law. But the end of Milosevic’s comprehensive control over RTS has opened 
      a new political era and provides a chance for freedom of expression to 
      take root. 
      <P>Had the international community been watching this television station 
      more closely in the late 1980s, it might have seen the warning signs of 
      impending doom in the former Yugoslavia. RTS and other media under 
      Milosevic’s control created the conditions that made war possible, 
      spreading fear among peaceful neighbours and persuading many Serbs that 
      the ghosts of the Second World War had returned to slaughter them. RTS 
      constructed a bizarre universe in which the Bosnian capital Sarajevo was 
      never besieged and the devastated Croatian town of Vukovar was 
      “liberated”. The media onslaught launched in Belgrade helped spawn similar 
      hateful propaganda elsewhere in other Yugoslav republics and its legacy 
      will be felt for years to come. 
      <P>Since the outbreak of fighting in the former Yugoslavia, millions of 
      dollars have been spent by NATO member states and other Western countries 
      in the Balkans, especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosnia) and Serbia, 
      in an attempt to repair the damage. International assistance has helped 
      the public in Serbia and Montenegro gain access to alternative sources of 
      information and helped counter the disinformation of state media. In 
      Bosnia, a degree of pluralism and media freedom has begun to emerge thanks 
      in part to international donations to independent newspapers and 
      broadcasters. 
      <P>Nevertheless, when it comes to preventing conflict or building peace, 
      media do not always receive the priority they deserve. Despite the 
      destructive role played by the media in fanning the flames of ethnic 
      hatred in former Yugoslavia, the peace agreement ending the Bosnian War, 
      negotiated in Dayton, Ohio, failed to include any specific provisions for 
      the media in the new state, other than a brief reference to freedom of the 
      press in relation to elections. International organisations charged with 
      overseeing implementation of the peace agreement have since spent much 
      time and energy making up for this oversight. 
      <P>Until autumn 1997, the international community in Bosnia was obliged to 
      tolerate the hate speech spewing from Srpska Radio-Televizija (SRT), the 
      station controlled by Milosevic’s protégés in Pale, Republika Srpska, just 
      outside Sarajevo. In the absence of coherent regulation of broadcast 
      frequencies or licensing and with the judiciary politically tainted, the 
      then High Representative, Carl Bildt — who described SRT as “media that 
      even Stalin would be ashamed of ” — had few tools at his disposal. 
      Nevertheless, in his last days as High Representative in May 1997, Bildt 
      laid the ground for a more robust approach. The Peace Implementation 
      Council, the gathering of countries and international organisations with a 
      stake in the Bosnian peace process, approved a document in Sintra, 
      Portugal, that empowered the High Representative to intervene against 
      media that posed a threat to the peace agreement. It was broad language 
      drafted with SRT’s inflammatory output in mind. 
      <P>In summer 1997, it became increasingly clear that SRT was undermining 
      the peace process. In addition to the inflammatory language used to 
      describe non-Serbs and hostility towards many aspects of the peace 
      accords, political opposition within Republika Srpska was denied coverage 
      and routinely attacked in the evening news. As a power struggle developed 
      between the hardline leadership in Pale and more moderate allies of 
      Republika Srpska’s then President Biljana Plavsic in Banja Luka, more 
      warnings were issued to SRT’s management with little effect. Press 
      officers for the new High Representative, Carlos Westendorp, hinted at 
      possible military action against SRT, but the NATO-led Stabilisation Force 
      (SFOR) remained cautious in its public pronouncements. 
      <P>It was a tense time for the peacekeeping mission and for NATO member 
      governments. SRT’s broadcasts were appalling, but Western governments 
      feared that if peace-keepers intervened against SRT, the Pale leadership 
      would gain sympathy by presenting themselves as defenders of free speech. 
      The pivotal event came in July, when Plavsic appointed new police chiefs 
      in Banja Luka with backing from UK and Czech SFOR peacekeepers. Details of 
      a planned coup by the Pale leadership against Plavsic were revealed. SRT 
      condemned SFOR’s role and compared the peacekeeping force to the Nazi SS 
      in a video clip. The propaganda now posed a threat to SFOR itself. 
      <P>When SRT broadcast a distorted account of a press conference by the 
      chief prosecutor of the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague, 
      SFOR troops intervened in response to a request from Westendorp, seizing 
      four transmission towers on 1 October 1997. SRT resumed broadcasting under 
      new leadership in the Banja Luka studios, where staff were more 
      sympathetic to Plavsic’s faction. The news programming remained 
      nationalist, but the excesses of the past were eliminated. The anticipated 
      backlash never materialised. Many Serb journalists had viewed SRT for what 
      it was, a political tool that had nothing to do with journalism or public 
      service. 
      <P>The Pale leadership had made no pretence about SRT’s partisan 
      structure. Senior member of the ruling nationalist Serb Democratic Party 
      (Srpska demokratska stranka or SDS) and the then Serb member of Bosnia’s 
      collective presidency, Momcilo Krajisnik (now awaiting trial in The Hague 
      for war crimes) headed SRT’s governing board. In the wake of SFOR’s 
      intervention, the Office of the High Representative (OHR) negotiated 
      “interim arrangements” for SRT with Plavsic, which were agreed in February 
      1998. These arrangements established a non-partisan governing board and 
      allowed for an international “administrator” who would promote public 
      broadcasting standards and editorial independence. 
      <P>The seizure of SRT’s transmission towers was a watershed for Bosnia. It 
      created a more level playing field for elections and paved the way for 
      more pluralism and media freedom in Banja Luka, the largest town in 
      Republika Srpska. The international community sent a clear message that it 
      was ready to act to halt incitement to hatred and partisan interference in 
      public broadcasting. It marked the end of the hardliners’ monopoly over 
      television in Republika Srpska. The crisis surrounding SRT underlined how 
      ruling nationalist parties throughout the country continued to dominate 
      the most influential media and discourage open debate. Bosnian media 
      clearly required systematic reform to bring them into line with democratic 
      norms. With the support of donor governments, OHR began developing a 
      strategy to build lasting media freedom. 
      <P>Over time, the strategy evolved into an ambitious undertaking. It 
      called for the creation of a regulatory framework for broadcasters, reform 
      of the public broadcasting sector, continued financial support for 
      independent media, public service campaigns to explain the international 
      community’s efforts and legal protection for journalists. 
      <P>The Peace Implementation Council’s December 1997 meeting in Bonn called 
      for the establishment of a regulatory body that would issue licences to 
      broadcasters according to transparent criteria. The regulatory agency, 
      which was later named the Independent Media Commission (IMC), was to 
      operate under interim international supervision and to become a domestic 
      institution in due course. It was designed to create fair competition for 
      broadcasters and to remove political control of the airwaves. 
      <P>With funding from the United States and the European Union, the IMC was 
      established in June 1998 by order of the High Representative. Each 
      department had an international head and a Bosnian deputy. An appellate 
      body comprised of Bosnian nationals and foreign experts, the IMC Council, 
      was set up to review appeals from stations. In the intervening period, the 
      IMC has managed to construct a regulatory framework that has stripped away 
      the kind of political manipulation that accompanied the issuing of 
      licences. By promulgating a broadcasting code of practice, the IMC has 
      helped deter inflammatory broadcasts, as stations tend to be reluctant to 
      jeopardise the licences they hold or future licences they hope to secure. 
      Some stations have been reprimanded or fined, a few were temporarily 
      ordered off the air, and two stations were shut down for occupying 
      frequencies illegally and forging documents. 
      <P>The jury is still out on the IMC. Bosnian journalists and other 
      international organisations have taken it to task for treading too softly 
      against flagrant propagandists and for moving too slowly to consolidate a 
      saturated media market. In a country with fewer than four million 
      inhabitants, there are some 280 broadcasters, probably the highest such 
      ratio in the world. The IMC says the criteria for new long-term licences 
      will be much stricter and result in a more rational market. The IMC also 
      maintains that it must respect legal procedures that allow stations due 
      process, with the result that the agency cannot act with the kind of speed 
      advocated by its critics. 
      <P>A more fundamental problem is that the IMC has to confront entrenched 
      interests with limited resources and no enforcement mechanism to implement 
      its decisions. In extreme cases, the IMC can turn to SFOR for assistance — 
      but only if NATO member states deem it appropriate to act. Rulings against 
      Erotel, a station controlled by Bosnian Croat hardliners of the Croat 
      Democratic Union (Hrvatska demokratska zajednica or HDZ), were flouted and 
      ignored for a year. 
      <P>Whatever IMC’s shortcomings, it has set a standard of transparency and 
      fairness that has greatly reduced political interference in broadcasting. 
      It has modelled itself on regulatory agencies in the European Union and 
      North America and avoided regulating print media, choosing instead to help 
      journalist associations agree a voluntary code of ethics. Although 
      excesses are still common in print media, plenty of independent 
      publications serve as a counter-balance. 
      <P>The biggest question for the future is how and when the IMC’s work will 
      be handed over to local authorities. An ambitious timetable for a transfer 
      this year has been reviewed and postponed. Bosnian institutions have yet 
      to prove that they can operate in a transparent and non-partisan manner. 
      Donor governments have approved a plan to subsume the IMC into a single 
      telecommunications regulatory agency under international supervision. 
      Current High Representative Wolfgang Petritsch has identified the 
      frequency spectrum as a vital economic resource that must be regulated in 
      a manner that discourages political interference and corrupt monopolies. 
      <P>Building a public broadcasting service out of the ashes of an 
      ethnically segregated, inefficient system has proven the most difficult 
      aspect of the OHR’s strategy. Vested political interests have fought to 
      retain control over the remnants of former Sarajevo Radio-Television, 
      Bosnia’s pre-war state broadcaster. Just before fighting erupted in the 
      spring of 1992, the Serb nationalist leader, Radovan Karadzic, proposed 
      dividing the station — which had a reputation for balanced, if prosaic, 
      reporting — into three ethnically separate channels. His proposal was 
      rejected but came to fruition once the war started. The assets of Sarajevo 
      Radio-Television were divided in accordance with territorial conquest. 
      Separate ethnically based stations were created with assistance from 
      Zagreb and Belgrade. In areas where the Bosnian government controlled 
      territory, Sarajevo television became known as Radio-Television 
      Bosnia-Herzegovina (RTV BiH) and fell under the political control of Alija 
      Izetbegovic’s Bosnian Muslim Party of Democratic Action (Stranka 
      demokratske akcije or SDA). Although oriented exclusively to Bosnian 
      Muslims, RTV BiH never engaged in the kind of explicit hate speech 
      employed by Croat and Serb regime media.

            </FONT></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>Within six months of SFOR’s 
      intervention against SRT, Westendorp launched a more comprehensive 
      initiative to reform the entire public broadcasting sector. After months 
      of negotiations with the country’s three-member presidency, he persuaded 
      the Croat and Bosnian Muslim representatives — but not the Serb — to agree 
      a memorandum of understanding on the future of broadcasting. This document 
      called for setting up a new public broadcasting service that would respect 
      religious tolerance and editorial independence and operate in a 
      financially transparent manner. It called for a new country-wide public 
      broadcasting network as well as a new service for the Federation of Bosnia 
      and Herzegovina (The Federation), the country’s slightly larger entity. It 
      also required broadcasters from Serbia and Croatia to abide by Bosnia’s 
      laws and regulations. In practice, however, the regimes in Belgrade and 
      Zagreb ignored these provisions, the SDA later obstructed implementation 
      of the reforms outlined in the memorandum and the HDZ rejected it after a 
      change in the Croat member of the Bosnian presidency. 
      <P>A new multi-ethnic board of governors at RTV BiH was, nevertheless, 
      appointed, though its work was obstructed by SDA loyalists. With the 
      memorandum stalled a year after its signing, Westendorp imposed a new 
      Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) for the entire country. Issued on his 
      last day in office in July 1999, the decision created a loose structure 
      designed to ensure that Bosnia’s statehood was respected, that the 
      SDA-dominated broadcaster would be succeeded by a genuine multi-ethnic 
      service and that a financially realistic model be pursued. 
      <P>OHR lawyers found legal backing for a state-level broad-caster in 
      Article II of the Bosnian constitution, which refers to the state setting 
      up communication facilities. It was a groundbreaking interpretation that 
      put an end to legal debates designed to obstruct multi-ethnic public 
      broadcasting. The decision created a broadcaster for the Federation as 
      well. Moreover, both entity broadcasters would in future only have access 
      to international programming through the new BiH service, which would 
      represent Bosnia in international organisations. The legal vacuum that had 
      allowed large mono-ethnic public broadcasters to develop was eliminated. 
      The new service was required to produce at least an hour of news and 
      current affairs programming daily. The decision was described as an 
      interim step and left room for future political representatives to amend 
      or develop as necessary. Given the constraints of the Dayton Agreement, 
      the limits of donor funding and the paralysed political climate at the 
      time, the OHR had pushed as far as it could. 
      <P>The PBS has now replaced RTV BiH as a member of the European 
      Broadcasting Union (EBU) and broadcasts international sporting events on a 
      country-wide signal. The Olympic games were aired with a multi-ethnic 
      staff of commentators and a current affairs programme allowed viewers to 
      participate in an election campaign discussion. An expert from the BBC has 
      set out guidelines for creating a management structure in line with modern 
      European practice. The High Representative has named multi-ethnic 
      governing boards for the entity broadcasters in both Republika Srpska and 
      the Federation. 
      <P>Nationalist political parties have inevitably tried to manipulate the 
      PBS governing board, obstructing its work at every step and portraying the 
      entire project as a failure. The failure, of course, lies with the 
      country’s political leadership. If Bosnia’s political leaders had embraced 
      public service broadcasting standards and multi-ethnic principles, then 
      the international community would never have intervened. Given the hostile 
      attitude of the nationalist parties, the delays in putting PBS on the air 
      with an evening news programme are understandable. However, it is now 
      vital that talented editors are recruited promptly and that PBS begins 
      airing an evening news programme. A quality PBS news service for the whole 
      country is crucial for building a climate free of intimidation and 
      religious intolerance. A more pluralistic political scene in Bosnia and 
      recent developments in Croatia and Serbia should offer some breathing 
      space for the PBS to develop. 
      <P>The most ambitious private media project in the Balkans was launched by 
      the first High Representative, Carl Bildt, shortly before the country’s 
      first elections in 1996. The United States and the European Union funded 
      the creation of a new multi-ethnic television network, the Open Broadcast 
      Network (OBN), which was meant to serve as a commercial alternative to the 
      mono-ethnic, politically controlled stations on the air. However, the 
      network got off to a poor start with shoddy journalism and weak 
      programming. It was run initially by diplomats with minimal experience in 
      broadcast management. OBN played no role in the 1996 election campaign as 
      it was barely on the air before the vote took place. Less than two years 
      later, after major infusions of cash and advice from television 
      professionals, OBN had put together a solid multi-ethnic news programme 
      that served as a genuine alternative to the nationalist party propaganda. 
      Civic opposition parties finally had a way of reaching voters with their 
      message. 
      <P>OBN met with fierce resistance among the nationalist parties, 
      particularly the SDA, which tried to deny it broad-cast frequencies. Some 
      donor governments refused to support it, preferring home-grown media 
      outlets. Despite its hefty price tag and shortcomings, OBN has played a 
      significant role in breaking down ethnic barriers and creating a fragile 
      pluralism in Bosnia. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in 
      Europe (OSCE) and the Swiss government launched a multi-ethnic radio 
      network, Radio FERN, in 1996 that proved less controversial. Radio FERN 
      has also produced a quality news service free of nationalist or political 
      bias and has helped build a network of independent stations across the 
      country. 
      <P>OBN’s principal sponsors, the United States and the European Union, had 
      hoped that the station could become a self-sustaining commercial network, 
      possibly covering a wider Serbo-Croat-speaking region. However, Bosnia’s 
      economy remains impoverished and the broadcasting market is saturated. As 
      a result, the donors may conclude that OBN cannot make it commercially. 
      Indeed, they are already discussing folding the news service into the PBS 
      structure. Regardless of OBN’s ultimate destiny, it has served an 
      invaluable role as a counter-balance to the fabrications and distortions 
      of the stations controlled by the nationalist parties. 
      <P>Funding news organisations in authoritarian environments inevitably 
      carries risks. Whenever money flows into corrupt and undemocratic 
      societies, powerful political interests find ways to get to the money or 
      hijack the station receiving the aid. To be effective and to ensure 
      taxpayers’ money is not wasted, a more coherent and unified approach by 
      donor governments is essential. But to date, the approach of the 
      international community has tended to resemble buckshot from a shotgun. 
      Some of the aid hits the target and much goes to waste. In Bosnia, the 
      media market is chaotic partly because Western governments were so ready 
      to fund new radio and television stations. 
      <P>There is also a danger that accompanies excessive faith in the 
      commercial broadcasting sector, especially in the longer run. Funding a 
      private station does not result automatically in editorial independence. 
      Private stations in countries that lack an independent judiciary or proper 
      commercial legislation are extremely vulnerable to manipulation by vested 
      political or financial interests. The example of tainted commercial 
      stations and publications throughout the former Soviet Union should serve 
      as a warning against throwing money at the private sector without strict 
      conditions. Otherwise, supposedly independent media turn into political 
      weapons paid for by taxpayers in the European Union and North America. 
      <P>To ensure that commercial media in Bosnia evolve in a free and 
      competitive environment, High Representative Petritsch recently suspended 
      privatisation of media until a thorough review could be conducted. The 
      focus of reform efforts in the future will likely turn to the 
      privatisation process and business aspects of the media. The international 
      community will need to push for the dismantling of media oligarchies and 
      prevent the birth of new monopolies. 
      <P>In terms of promoting the legal protection of journalists, the 
      international community has begun replacing the communistera laws that 
      stifled free speech and journalistic inquiry. In July 1999, Westendorp 
      invoked his authority as High Representative to strike down a provision 
      that allowed prison sentences for those convicted under the defamation 
      law. He called for a new defamation law and a freedom of information law 
      to be drafted under international guidance. In October 2000, the state 
      parliament adopted a law prepared by OSCE experts that grants free access 
      to information held by governmental bodies except for a narrow range of 
      categories. The freedom of information law, even if it is only partially 
      enforced, carries the potential of transforming the culture of secrecy 
      that has prevailed among Bosnia’s political leaders. 
      <P>A few representatives of press freedom organisations have accused NATO 
      member states of violating free speech by taking action against media 
      deemed inflammatory. When the IMC was established, these same critics 
      claimed that media freedom would be endangered by an all-powerful agency 
      ready to act arbitrarily. While there are obviously risks involved in any 
      interventionist media strategy, many of the critics start from the wrong 
      premises. 
      <P>Instead of considering Bosnia, or indeed Kosovo, Rwanda or East Timor 
      in terms of a Western democracy, it is important to view these countries 
      through the lens of Germany in 1945. Do we promote free speech if we 
      tolerate political control over broadcast frequencies and printing 
      presses? If demagogues and dictators are allowed to incite religious, 
      ethnic or racial hatred and genocide, do we uphold our democratic values? 
      In countries without democratic traditions or institutions, there is no 
      robust judicial system that protects journalists, no regulatory agency 
      that prevents political interests from controlling publicly funded 
      broadcasters, and no free market that ensures open access to printing 
      presses and advertisers. Doing nothing simply enables vested interests to 
      stifle journalists and dissent. 
      <P>Where a multinational military keeps the peace, a maximum degree of 
      international authority should be exercised in the media sector earlier 
      rather than later. Frequencies should not be handed out by political 
      oligarchies. Adopting a laissez-faire approach to former warring factions 
      signals weakness and offers opportunities to revive conflict. Better to 
      take a firm line at the beginning and in this way lay the ground for an 
      earlier withdrawal. An international strategy for fundamental economic and 
      judicial reform must, how-ever, accompany any attempt to promote media 
      freedom. Political control of the economy precludes any attempt to 
      establish a free, independent “Fourth Estate”. Printing presses, 
      advertising sources and access to frequencies must be free of political 
      interference. Without an independent judiciary and police force, there is 
      no protection against threats to journalistic inquiry and free speech. 
      <P>One point that some press freedom activists have made, nevertheless, 
      deserves more consideration. Institutions or regulations imposed by 
      international administrators should conform to democratic standards 
      because, at some point, the peacekeepers will depart and hand over to 
      local authorities. Whatever is created by international peacekeeping 
      missions will eventually be inherited by domestic governments. As much as 
      possible, the laws, institutions and regulations that the international 
      community supports should be based on best democratic practice and 
      principles. Intervention by the international authority on the ground must 
      follow due process and be accompanied by broader, democratic reforms that 
      protect journalistic inquiry. If there is no due process and no clear 
      democratic principle at stake, intervening in the media or any other 
      sector only to influence political developments tends to backfire. Donor 
      governments cannot be seen to be violating the laws and regulations that 
      operate in their own countries. 
      <P>The good news is that the climate has improved for media freedom in 
      Bosnia since 1995, sometimes because of the presence of the international 
      community and sometimes in spite of it. The bad news is that the gains 
      made so far are tenuous and dependent on vast, foreign donations. Too 
      little attention has been devoted to training and educating aspiring 
      journalists. Perhaps the benefits are not visible quickly enough for donor 
      governments, which feel obliged to produce immediate results with aid 
      money. The BBC School for broadcast news in Sarajevo, for example, which 
      is sponsored by the United Kingdom and George Soros’ Open Society Fund, 
      has been an unqualified success and is helping shape a new generation of 
      independent-minded broadcast journalists. International funding will 
      inevitably decline over time. But it is critical to take the reform 
      process forward. The media carry vast potential both to ignite war and to 
      help establish democracy. Freeing them from political control should carry 
      the same strategic priority as removing landmines or building bridges.
