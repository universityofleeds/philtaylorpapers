<P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he history of conflict is littered with examples
of military success that ultimately failed to achieve political aims. In
exploiting victory, political and military leaders alike have sometimes
failed to recognize justice and equity as necessary components of peaceful
relations among states. If our intent is to avoid war, then at the end
of a conflict we must create the conditions for peace, rather than for
subsequent strife. If we are to overcome strategic myopia, we must address
the civil sector. </P>

<P>During war, international law endeavors to protect the populace from
excessive threats to life and property. Failure to ensure noncombatant
immunity may prolong a conflict, repress a struggle until a later generation,
or draw additional belligerents into a war. At a minimum, it encumbers
post-conflict reconciliation. Strategic leaders, civilian and military
alike, must therefore look beyond the array of opposing military forces
to the relationship that should emerge among belligerents once the conflict
ends. A comparison of military end-states is necessary but not sufficient
to meeting political objectives. The key to any post-conflict vision of
relations among states is the civil sector. </P>

<P>The means to develop and maintain a long-range perspective on conflict
termination exist within the US military force structure, but have seldom
been employed at the strategic level from the outset of deliberate or contingency
planning. This article therefore considers the needs of a postwar environment
and the strategic guidance required to shape that environment. An essential
component of that guidance will be missing unless civil affairs personnel
are assigned at national, theater, and operational levels to ensure the
opposing populace is treated appropriately. </P>

<P><B>Conflict Termination</B> </P>

<P>Under the rubric of conflict termination, strategists have recently
begun to consider the relation between the conclusion of military campaigns
and achievable political end-states. Despite its recent attention, this
relationship is no major innovation. Clausewitz tells us that no one begins
a war without considering what he wishes to achieve by it.[1] But his observation
should not be limited to the strategic offensive. In countering the aggression
of another, the defender has historically had an opportunity to influence
the resulting political environment as well. Thus, peace treaties have
often reshaped the political landscape in consequence of the defender's
campaign. Unfortunately, the victors who dictate peace terms have often
reacted more to opportunism or parochial dynastic or class interests than
political wisdom. As Frederick the Great noted, conquests may be fatal
to victors as well as the vanquished.[2] </P>

<P>Political leaders have seldom acted in accord with principles that facilitate
a long-term solution to conflict between states. In a monograph on <I>How
Wars End</I>, William Fox notes that the Peace of Vereeniging, which in
1902 ended the Boer War, brought no reconciliation between the British
and the Boers.[3] This failure undoubtedly played a significant role two
decades later, when Jan Smuts, who had been a Boer opponent of the British,
was a British delegate to the peace conference ending World War I. Seeing
the draconian measures imposed on the Central Powers, and remembering the
harsh treatment of the Boers, Smuts agonized over whether to sign the Treaty
of Versailles. Several of his contemporary senior military leaders recognized
but failed to communicate successfully to their political superiors that
the peace terms imposed helped create the conditions for a subsequent war.
</P>

<P>History provides other examples of political leadership incapable of
realizing its vision. As chancellor of Prussia, Otto von Bismarck was able
to offer Austria generous terms to conclude the Six Weeks War (1866), ensuring
Prussia's ascendancy among German states without antagonizing Austria into
an alliance with France. (In 1870 the Austrian chancellor supported the
interests of Napoleon III, but Austrian opinion did not support another
war with Prussia.) Prussia's campaign against Austria had been swift, but
that against France was not so simple. When victory is dear, an impetus
for compensation develops. Thus, in 1871 Bismarck was unable to limit France's
territorial loss to Alsace, and this failure precluded the reconciliation
of France and Germany. During World War I, German diplomacy made a comparable
mistake by failing to proclaim that Germany had no territorial ambitions
in Belgium.[4] </P>

<P>Similarly, the Wilsonian vision for Europe fell prey to the other Allies'
desire to make Germany pay for all Europe's transgressions. Thus, the victors
applied democratic principles only to some territories of the vanquished
and then with varying degrees of democratic procedural guarantees.[5] In
other cases, they simply took territories from the vanquished, despite
creating ethnic enclaves, to meet their own imperialistic goals. </P>

<P>In concluding World War II as an ascendant democratic power, the United
States addressed treatment of its defeated adversaries more successfully
than the old Imperial Powers had done in previous wars, but the road to
progressive policy was both laborious and incomplete. In a dissertation
devoted to Roosevelt's development of occupation policy in Europe, USAF
Colonel Dan Allen discusses the views of Cabinet members on the treatment
of Germany after World War II. He notes long discussions among the Secretaries
of State, War, and Treasury, and presidential advisor Harry Hopkins (former
Secretary of Commerce) over postwar treatment of Germany. Allen comments
on the alternative proposed by Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, which would
have compounded the disaster of the Treaty of Versailles by following it
with a solution akin to the Romans' destruction of Carthage after the Second
Punic War: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The destruction rather than redirection of German industrial might was
a tragedy to Stimson and bordered on criminal action. Such a program along
with the subsistence diets being proposed surely laid the groundwork for
yet another war. . . . Stimson commented that Morgenthau was bitter and
a bit ignorant of both history and economics.[6] </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>and further: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Stimson continued to argue against the [Morgenthau] plan. He felt it
was an &quot;open confession of the bankruptcy of hope for a reasonable
economic and political settlement of the causes of war.&quot;[7] </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In the end, Germany was divided, occupied, and hardly treated with a
view toward reconciliation. The Marshall Plan for the recovery of Europe
has the mythic reputation of offering magnanimity to Germany. But Marshall's
proposal was not offered until 1947, after a new global ideological threat
had emerged. Although the Marshall Plan did provide a marked contrast to
the treatment of the Central Powers at Versailles in 1919, it came as an
afterthought, not as part of the peace plan. </P>

<P>The subsequent evolution of European states' economies demonstrates
the interdependencies we have come to expect as the norm: a mutually advantageous
environment among states. But since we see from these few examples of visions
of war and peace that political leaders often fail to articulate successfully
a strategic vision for harmonious relations among states, national security
advisors must be prepared to offer views of a beneficial world order as
a step beyond stating war aims in reaction to a provocation. Fox comments
on Britain's senior leaders, &quot;Lord Milner in 1902 and Lloyd George
in 1918 do not seem to have been much interested in a peace of reconciliation,
either before or after victory.&quot;[8] Particularly when the need for
reconciliation goes unrecognized, the strategic planner needs to offer
a vision that incorporates benefits for the vanquished populace. </P>

<P><I>The Dayton Peace Accords as an Example of Conflict Termination</I>
</P>

<P>Much Cold War-era discussion of conflict termination is applicable to
small-scale wars between belligerents of limited means. While this article
argues that reconciliation is necessary to conclude <I>any</I> conflict
successfully, negotiations in circumstances of mutual exhaustion are unencumbered
by opportunistic war aims of a jubilant, victorious power. No clear victorious
or vanquished power emerged from the 1991-95 Balkans War, and the negotiated
peace, which attempts to reconcile the factions, is instructive for the
means it employs to achieve peace. </P>

<P>The annexes of the Dayton Peace Accords specify a variety of mechanisms
for democratization, protection of human rights, and economic development.
Specific European organizations have accepted roles in creating the postwar
state of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In arriving at these roles, the negotiators
and the Contact Group have shown strategic vision. At the political level,
the Contact Group recognized the post-hostilities requirements. At the
theater level, the original campaign plan of the Supreme Allied Commander,
Europe (SACEUR) for deploying the Implementation Force (IFOR) foresaw linkages
between the military and civilian leadership. A key element in this example
is the deployment of an extensive civil affairs structure to link the military
peacekeeping force and civilian mechanisms that were to implement the vision.
There are still gaps in implementation, and they are at the point where
strategic policy and implementation meet. </P>

<P>At the operational level, civil affairs practitioners can bring the
appropriate players together, but at the interagency level within the US
government, a project such as peace-building requires policy direction
that benefits from such aspects as these: </P>

<UL>
<LI>overview of available resources </LI>

<LI>constraints on their use </LI>

<LI>alternatives for economic development </LI>

<LI>resources for immediate and long-term needs </LI>

<LI>interface among resource providers, indigenous government officials,
the Contact Group, and the peacekeeping force </LI>
</UL>

<P>The constraints, in particular, require reflection. At the announcement
that the United States would deploy 20,000 troops, the Clinton Administration
was eager to note that the United States would not engage in nation-building.
Ostensibly a sign that meant we would not be investing heavily in reconstructing
Bosnia's infrastructure, this constraint is considerable and triggers varying
reactions. Nation-building may mean different things to different readers,
but what is the effect of such a constraint? </P>

<P>Some may ask why Europe or America should pay to rebuild a society destroyed
in a civil war when the factions created the situation, are responsible
for rebuilding their own economy, and will be the ones to benefit. While
self-interest could lead to local bootstrap measures, this perspective
would forego the immediate effect of external start-up capital. Self-initiated
mortgaging of infrastructure is difficult since foreign debt inherited
from Yugoslavia complicates the availability of foreign exchange, and services
and construction materials must be paid for in a hard currency. </P>

<P>At the corps and division levels, civil-military operations make an
effort to improve the living conditions of the populace. In countries with
large bureaucracies, discussions will predictably take place as to whether
defense, foreign-aid, development, or disaster-assistance budgets should
pay for civic-action programs. Alternatively, the populace may be left
solely to the goodwill of donors. </P>

<P>Just as in war, a military mission short of conflict requires the allocation
of multiple elements of national power. If a nation's strategic aims require
deploying troops, their mission requires the support of nonmilitary resources.
At the operational level, one can facilitate connections among government
agencies, but identifying and requesting sources of funding at that echelon
is complicated by distance from national-level decisionmaking. At best,
civil affairs personnel might broker programs among government agencies
and nongovernmental actors, whereas a similar, coordinated attempt at the
strategic level would improve the chances of success. Identifying a responsible
agency for civic action may require participation by a theater strategic
planner. </P>

<P>The allocation of resources to reestablish post-conflict economic stability
is an interagency matter that requires an understanding of the strategic
end-state desired. Although theoretically it matters little whether this
strategic direction takes place in Defense or State or at the National
Security Council, there must be a mechanism to ensure coordination between
the staffs of combatant commanders and the various government and nongovernment
agencies contributing to post-conflict development or crisis resolution.
Presidential Decision Directive 56 (PDD-56) addresses interagency coordination
of separate agencies' planning in the context of a &quot;complex contingency
operation,&quot; rather than extending such coordination to all operations
with substantial troop deployments. As background to PDD-56, we have the
recent operational examples of the Bosnia and Haiti task forces at the
interagency level which undertook to broker policy and resources. But such
interagency mechanisms require a direct link to the appropriate combatant
command staff to provide an overview of available nonmilitary instruments
of power, notably diplomatic policy and development aid, for the staff
element to assess their adequacy and suitability. A civil affairs element
is appropriate for such a link. </P>

<P>French civil affairs doctrine acknowledges the importance of interagency
coordination to a strategic assessment of civil-sector conditions. In a
directive on the conduct of civil-military activities, it specifies a chain
of command for civil-military action articulated at four levels: political,
strategic, operational, and tactical.[9] At the strategic level, French
doctrine recognizes three emphases--concept of operations, plans, and conduct
of operations--each of which requires consideration of civil-sector concerns
and coordination with appropriate ministries to deal with civil-sector
issues. </P>

<P>US policy recognizes strategic implications of civil affairs activities,
and the appropriate assistant secretary of defense is charged with translating
&quot;national security policy objectives into specific defense policy
objectives achievable through civil affairs.&quot;[10] The assistant secretary
is also charged to &quot;monitor interagency use of DOD forces for civil
affairs activities&quot; and &quot;approve the detail of civil affairs
personnel to duty with interagency groups and non-DOD organizations.&quot;
Such a policy, workable in a peacetime environment, requires considerable
flexibility in crisis, peace support, or war. Particularly in a peace support
or disaster-relief environment, operations undertaken by the State Department's
Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance or by the Justice Department's Community
Relations Service are likely to profit from a close working relationship
with civil affairs elements at the operational level. But unlike DOD's
use of reservists, such agencies typically contract for services, and those
hired may have a greater appreciation for the immediate task at hand than
for integration of government policy. A quick infusion of civil affairs
staff support in such a situation would be useful, but its appropriateness
and duration need to be continually assessed by an element in the chain
of command attuned to interagency division of labor as well as to strategic
objectives. </P>

<P><I>Allied and Coalition Goals</I> </P>

<P>If the effort to focus the various elements of national power on the
civil end-state of a conflict or peace operation seems complex at the national
level, it is considerably more so in an alliance or coalition environment.
After an arduous conflict, a clear victor will be inclined to pressure
the vanquished foe to replace political leaders and structures. Political
issues such as empowering local administrators in an occupied or just-liberated
country require a different approach from that used to restore infrastructure.
Achieving political reforms requires negotiating strategic direction of
civil affairs with our partners because each will have a sense of the desirability
of keeping or replacing officials who were appointed by the government
with which we were just at war, or accepting or appointing officials in
a liberated country that may not have had time to replace its political
leadership. </P>

<P>Dan Allen gives us an example of the difficulty of coordinating civil
affairs or military government policy in a relatively simple two-nation
alliance. Discussing the Allied control policy for the occupation of Italy,
he observes: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It appeared to the Americans that they were making an active contribution
to a bigger and better British Empire. . . . Myron Taylor, United States
representative to the Vatican City, . . . felt the British dominated Allied
policy in Italy. The British, in his opinion, were attempting to retard
recovery at the moment, hoping Italy would be a source of markets for British
goods in the post-war era. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In Venezia Giulia, which had been Italian territory only since the end
of World War I, the situation was more complicated. Since Yugoslav partisans
had helped overcome Fascist control in the region, there was reason to
consider Yugoslavian demands for territory. The legitimacy of those demands
notwithstanding, Allied assistance in substituting one totalitarian regime
for another would hardly have constituted achievement of war aims.[11]
</P>

<P><B>Reconstructing Infrastructure</B> </P>

<P>Among the highly appreciated specialties in civil affairs are those
that assess the repair and reconstruction needs of the civil infrastructure
in a post-hostilities or post-disaster environment. Such assessments range
across the spectrum of societal needs, from public health (especially water
supply and sanitation) to transportation, power, and communications. The
value of these teams is not in their manual skills but in the assessments
they provide and the priorities they develop for reconstruction. An overview
of financial resources to be applied to this reconstruction is difficult
to derive because there are gaps in identified funding mechanisms. At the
strategic level these gaps in assessing and projecting progress are predictable.
Strategic planners should address such issues as these: </P>

<UL>
<LI>how to begin the process </LI>

<LI>the resources available </LI>

<LI>timing and means of transition from external assistance to indigenous
executive (ministerial) agencies </LI>

<LI>the national and coalition or alliance constraints under which assessment
and reconstruction must operate </LI>
</UL>

<P>None of these issues is simple, and in each case the resolution is likely
to be highly situation-specific. The Gulf War, for example, was heavily
financed by the Kuwaiti and Saudi governments. Kuwaiti finances were so
secure that reconstruction financing was never in doubt. By contrast, bringing
stability to Haiti or to Bosnia-Herzegovina creates entirely different
challenges. Although the issues raised here are clearly civil matters,
the military commander must determine when a transition to civilian control
can occur. He must therefore assess the capacity of local institutions
to assume these responsibilities. </P>

<P><I>Public Safety</I> </P>

<P>After-action reviews have pointed to shortfalls in planning for police
coverage of an area under transition from a previous power. When the United
States undertook Operation Just Cause in 1989, it failed to appreciate
the effect on civil order of incapacitating the Panamanian Defense Force.
This organization performed both military and police functions; in its
absence, rampant looting became a problem. The US Department of Justice
helped resolve the policing issue with a training program for Panamanian
police, later applied in Haiti as well. </P>

<P>The Dayton Peace Accords foresaw the need for an International Police
Task Force (IPTF) in Bosnia, but only to train and monitor. Task force
personnel lack police powers. Once the police task force deployed--an event
delayed by the need to recruit and qualify candidates and second them from
their everyday jobs to this assignment--it discovered that the proportion
of police to populace in Bosnia far exceeded that in most Western nations.
Without a mandate to assume police powers, neither the IPTF nor IFOR could
prevent the destruction of homes and neighborhoods by Bosnian Serbs departing
Sarajevo--clearly not a policy conducive to reconciliation. </P>

<P>French civil affairs doctrine sees the civil police component as a confidence-building
measure in peace support operations: &quot;Supervision of activities of
public order favor the reestablishment of confidence at the core of the
civil populace, in particular of minorities that could be threatened.&quot;[12]
Such recognition is important, and it reflects directly on theater-level
nonmilitary support of civil concerns over which a theater commander should
have some cognizance. </P>

<P><B>Civil-Sector Economic Concerns and Military Operations</B> </P>

<P>Treasury officials will be the primary actors in economic warfare, a
topic beyond the scope of this article, but military planners at the theater
level must consider a number of economic factors that constrain or facilitate
military operations and must issue appropriate strategic guidance. In operations
that do not require significant mobilization, military staff will need
to address economic issues. Civil affairs financiers are the optimal asset
for issuing and coordinating such guidance. At the operational level, for
example, military forces confront many currency issues. When coalition
forces liberated Kuwait, they faced issues of Kuwait's economic security
because Iraq had had access to the Kuwaiti central bank. The reconstituted
Kuwaiti government reissued its currency to invalidate banknotes in the
hands of the Iraqis. The Kuwait Task Force, an advisory group to the Kuwaiti
government in exile with a civil affairs core, played a role in this reissuance
as well as in a subsequent measure regarding postage stamps, the negotiability
of which has a similar effect on economic security. </P>

<P>A World War II example defines a situation American forces have not
seen since that time. As part of planning the invasion of France, the combined
staff considered the type of currency they would use in France. A new issue
of currency was desirable to control inflation, penalize collaborators,
and undermine war profiteers. The decision to issue Supplemental Francs
did not sit well with the French Committee for National Liberation (the
Free French), which wanted to issue its own currency. If the American and
British governments allowed the Free French franc, it would imply recognition
of De Gaulle's organization as the government of France, a recognition
they were not prepared to extend. Faced with the alternative of distinctive
American and British currencies, which could have been interpreted to mean
that France was under Allied occupation, De Gaulle eventually relented.
</P>

<P>Tactical civil affairs doctrine calls for determining whether the economy
is functioning normally or subject to black market activity. This analysis
contributes to an assessment; it does not initiate an economic stabilization
program. At the theater level, economic activity should be promoted as
a primary means to ensure the residents have the means to feed and house
themselves. How do such programs begin? In Haiti, nongovernmental organizations
were instrumental in creating work programs and job-training efforts. But
since guidance for developing economic stability in the civil sector is
a strategic civil affairs task, an interagency task force should develop
policy for creating economic stability in a specific country or region.
</P>

<P>If an occupation is necessary, the occupying force will need to continue
collecting taxes to finance the operation of local and provincial governments
until a national government can resume this task. The occupier certainly
will not want to shoulder this burden, but occupation forces will have
to ensure both the functioning of government and its means of financing.
</P>

<P>A military campaign may be preceded by an economic embargo employed
as a flexible deterrent option, which then remains in place as an economic
measure inhibiting the opponent's prosecution of a war. Monitoring the
effect of economic measures may be primarily a Treasury Department interest,
but at the conclusion of a military campaign, military strategic planners
must coordinate with Treasury officials to ensure that appropriate efforts
to lift economic constraints take place as needed. This task is not a simple
matter to coordinate. During the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, the latter's
assets abroad were frozen for fear that Iraq would otherwise control them.
Consequently, the Kuwaiti financing of their government in exile and all
contracts undertaken during planning for the liberation and reconstitution
of government ministries had to be financed with full faith and credit
against eventual payment. Later, during the Kurdish rescue, nongovernmental
organizations sought assurances from Combined Task Force Provide Comfort
that their expenditures in northern Iraq did not violate the embargo. Civil
affairs personnel provided the needed coordination to ensure the arrival
of these relief organizations. </P>

<P><B>Reconstructing Government</B> </P>

<P>Many of the tasks described in this article pose challenges beyond the
functional expertise obviously required to meet them. The short history
of peacekeeping has provided few opportunities for exploring the constraints
on relations between peacekeepers and local inhabitants and the challenges
these assessments bring to the establishment of a strategic end-state.[13]
Far more common to our experience is the civil administration found in
both ministerial advisory teams for emerging democracies and in their predecessor,
military government. </P>

<P><I>Civil Affairs and Military Government</I> </P>

<P>Although consideration for a populace residing in an area subject to
conflict is nothing new, much of US civil affairs doctrine is primarily
traceable to the experience of the Allied forces deployed to Europe during
the Second World War. This valuable legacy also haunts the definitions
and scope of civil affairs as practiced or avoided by NATO militaries.
Several features of this bequest deserve mention. </P>

<P>The US Army engaged in military government extensively in the 19th century,
especially during the occupation of areas of the South during the American
Civil War. The Class of 1911 at the Army Staff Schools at Ft. Leavenworth
even published a volume of case studies in military government that considered
issues from the War of 1812 through the Spanish-American War. But the topic
has long occasioned skepticism among the general public. </P>

<P>Thus, it was by no means certain that President Roosevelt would allow
the War Department to create a military government apparatus for the European
Theater of Operations. Initially, Roosevelt preferred civilian agencies
to undertake governance. Civilian agencies had such a role during the American
Civil War, the Spanish-American War, and World War I, but the War Department's
position was that this experience should not be repeated. The War Department
staff observed, </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The outstanding lesson gained from American experiences in military
government, including the Civil War and Philippine Insurrection, and from
experiences of other countries, is that the prime direction and administration
of military government belongs wholly to the military command.[14] </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>A theoretical approach to political-military affairs can lead to a similar
conclusion. Despite Clausewitz's cautionary recommendation regarding occupying
enemy territory, he recognizes the need for an occupation until a peace
is final. Until the peace settlement, the enemy must be prevented from
developing a resurgent capacity. Since the inherent tasks need close coordination
with one's own military forces and entail considerable danger to individuals
undertaking these tasks, these functions should be accomplished by military
personnel. But there are additional reasons for a primary reliance on military
organizations. Again drawing on World War II experience, we find that Secretary
of War Stimson blamed many of the difficulties in conducting civil affairs
on &quot;multi-agency interference in civil affairs&quot; as well as on
&quot;the administrative habits of the President,&quot; notably creating
more than 130 executive agencies to deal with various aspects of the war.[15]
As a result of the experiences in Africa, one senior Army officer noted
that particularly in areas where fighting was in progress, civil affairs
could not be separated from military operations.[16] </P>

<P>As we know, in 1942 the War Department won this competition with other
federal agencies for the responsibility of civil administration in occupied
territory, but the notion of military government remains unsettling to
diplomatic and military elements and the public alike. Since the mid-1970s,
civil affairs curricula have generally avoided consideration of military
government, even after the recognition of this task in the 1994 DOD Directive
on Civil Affairs.[17] Instructors in civil affairs courses generally treat
civil administration of an occupied territory as a potential mission to
be undertaken in extreme circumstances. Although the coalition avoided
military government during the Gulf War, it is by no means certain that
we can do so in the future. </P>

<P>The differentiation of activities under civil affairs or military government
is a matter of degree rather than kind. During World War II, the practice
of civil administration in territories that had been occupied by the Axis
powers was called civil affairs, whereas in Germany, Italy, and later Japan
it was called military government.[18] Although the functions are the same,
distinctions were needed to differentiate between political purposes of
reestablishing services in a formerly occupied country until its government
in exile (if one existed) could resume its governing functions and doing
the same until victorious powers replaced the local administration of a
former enemy with one more to its liking. Nevertheless, the spillover of
opposition to military government has reduced emphasis on the civil administration
mission of civil affairs. The legacy of the Cold War era also contributed
to an academic atrophy in studying this realm. It was unthinkable for our
German allies to consider occupying territory beyond NATO's boundaries;
the consequence for NATO has been that &quot;civil affairs&quot; is listed
in NATO's dictionary of terms as a wartime function without further definition.
</P>

<P><I>Civil Affairs Forces and Levels of Operations</I> </P>

<P>Experience at the Army's combat training centers has emphasized the
need for an understanding of civil affairs activities at the tactical level.
But after-action reviews by senior military leaders and the comments of
ambassadors who have headed various country teams have reserved their highest
praise for those civil affairs personnel working at the operational level.
Civil affairs personnel demonstrate their worth most cogently in post-hostilities
transition operations. That time period in which a government establishes
(or reestablishes) itself requires a security presence (military forces)
and a staff element that can coordinate services, activities, and development
planning among government agencies and between government agencies and
various international providers. These providers range from relief agencies
to financial institutions to development organizations. Ministerial advisory
teams in Panama and Haiti, the Kuwait Task Force, and the civil-military
task force in support of IFOR and SFOR in Bosnia all provide abundant evidence
of the value of civil affairs units in establishing stability in a post-conflict
environment. </P>

<P>But what about the strategic level? Is there a taxonomy of civil-sector
issues that demands at our most senior regional headquarters staff cognizance,
issuance of policy or command guidance, and anticipation of third-order
effects? Although developing such a catalog is beyond the scope of this
article, an exploration of some strategic civil affairs issues demonstrates
the interrelations between military and other elements of national power
and their collaborative ability to resolve conflicts and establish stability.
At the national interagency level, staff may address both military and
civil concerns, and at senior military headquarters many staff elements
review civil support to military operations. The following examples demonstrate
a range of concerns from regional strategic goals to <I>jus in bello</I>
considerations to successful conflict termination. This range also demonstrates
why it is necessary to address the civil sector continuously, not only
in post-hostilities consolidation. </P>

<P><B>Civil-Sector Issues in Operations</B> </P>

<P>Arguments for restraint on the collateral damage a civil populace suffers
take primarily two approaches: moral and instrumental. Moral considerations
and their codification in international law and treaties dictate restraint
in subjecting noncombatants to suffering. But advocates of restraint may
tailor their arguments to specific audiences. B. H. Liddell Hart takes
the instrumental approach in his <I>Remaking of Modern Armies</I>. In dealing
with the &quot;Napoleonic fallacy,&quot; he observes: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The economic limitation is that by destroying the enemy factories and
communications we may so cripple his commerce and industry as seriously
to reduce his post-war value as a potential customer. . . . [T]he destruction
of the enemy country's economic wealth recoils on the head of the victor.[19]
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Although his argument emphasizes the value to political economy of future
trade relations, it is as valid to argue that in industrial-target selection,
planners need to consider the postwar effects of their choices. A recurring
theme throughout any consideration of the effects of military operations
on a society must be the postwar reconciliation that will be needed between
belligerents--a theme now recognized in US joint military doctrine.[20]
Liddell Hart concluded that &quot;the enemy of today is the customer of
the morrow and the ally of the future.&quot;[21] </P>

<P>A transition between instrumental and moral arguments is found in the
circumstance in which a violation of moral codes alters the composition
of opposing coalitions. During the Thirty Years War, outrage at the civilian
casualties of the battle of Magdeburg led neutral princes to side with
Swedish King Gustavus Adolphus.[22] Even today, the risk of encouraging
a neutral to join a conflict remains high if one belligerent engages in
flagrant <I>jus in bello</I> violations. We have examples in the Persian
Gulf and the Balkans. Although the free flow of oil is a US vital interest
that dictated the need for intervention, the Iraqi regime's atrocious treatment
of the Kuwaitis gave the United States a compelling moral argument for
intervention that the Bush Administration used to support its public diplomacy
in sectors where the economic arguments would have been less effective.
Similarly, although no outside power entered as a belligerent in the 1991-95
Balkans conflict, the frequent and flagrant violation of noncombatant immunity
compelled Western European nations to intervene.[23] </P>

<P><I>A Commander's Conscience</I> </P>

<P>Observers at the Vienna Roundtable on Human Rights in Bosnia-Herzegovina[24]
should have been struck by the simultaneous presence of organizations that
wished to bring peace and justice to the area in missionary fashion and
groups from the Balkans that demonstrated they were fully competent to
present a human-rights agenda of their own. Outsiders can easily see the
moral shortcomings of a given society, and these failings can lead interventionists
to the facile conclusion that they must supply the resources to rectify
problems in an adversary's society. Unfortunately, this attitude blinds
us to sources of indigenous moral strength. With the benefit of historical
distance, examples of righteous conduct by an opponent may be all the more
instructive. </P>

<P>Thus, a World War II German general demonstrates a senior commander's
strategic consideration of the need for post-hostilities reconciliation,
regardless of whether he is victor or vanquished. Dietrich von Choltitz
provides an excellent example of concern for the populace under his control.
As commanding general of greater Paris, he might well have acted differently
than he did.[25] But his memoirs depict both his choices and his rationale.
For example: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Did I have the right to plunge a metropolis into misfortune by setting
up a defense in its center that would not have been able to change a whit
in the overall campaign? I thought about the future relationship of two
great neighboring peoples.[26] </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The Iraqi destruction of Kuwaiti oil wells could have had a precedent
in Paris, as Hitler had ordered its destruction. Calling this order the
&quot;Tr&uuml;mmerfeldbefehl,&quot; an order to leave the city in ruins,
Choltitz considered the workers, the city, and the perhaps far-off reconciliation
between France and Germany. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If I demolish industry, I take away the livelihood of the worker, who
all these years has worked in orderly and productive fashion and who still
behaves completely quietly, and I throw him on the street, with his eyes
wide open, and into the Resistance. I make a warrior out of him out of
need and desperation. But it had to be my goal to keep the city in peace
and quiet. Therefore, I tried to tie him to his place of work by having
the wages raised. . . . And what barbarity I was ordered to undertake!
. . . [It was] my firm intent from the beginning as a decent soldier to
protect the civil populace and its beautiful city however possible and
under my control. . . . I had to do whatever possible to protect Paris
from destruction.[27] </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Choltitz saw it as his duty &quot;to protect the wives and children
even of the enemy and to maintain the values of his culture.&quot;[28]
He seemed convinced that the destruction of Paris would have precluded
future dialogue between French and Germans. </P>

<P><I>Strategic Guidance for Treatment of Civilians</I> </P>

<P>Military discipline enforced by field commanders includes guidance on
the treatment of civilians in the area of operations. Although it can come
from any level, a number of precedents support a preference for issuing
such guidance at the national level. James Turner Johnson provides examples
of the Swedes under Gustavus Adolphus, the English under Cromwell, and
the Union armies under Lincoln.[29] </P>

<P>In 1632, Gustavus Adolphus issued <I>The Swedish Discipline</I>, which
set standards of behavior toward civilians. The <I>Discipline</I> treated
pillaging and destruction of churches, hospitals, and public property.
It prohibited destroying friendly towns and permitted destruction of enemy
towns only if the commander determined a military necessity to do so, thus
holding the commander accountable for such actions. There is a parallel
between the Swedes' situation in 1632 and the Allies' in 1942. The Swedes
entered the Thirty Years War after the Imperial troops had committed serious
atrocities in Magdeburg, yet Gustavus saw the need for prohibiting unnecessary
destruction by his own forces. Despite German forces' treatment of civilians
on the Eastern front and the occupation's conduct of the Holocaust across
Europe during World War II, this behavior apparently was not, and should
not have been, used as justification for the British strategic air campaign
of terror bombing of civilian targets, about which more below. </P>

<P>Johnson mentions considerable work in 19th-century America on military
ethics in battle. Key among these works is Francis Lieber's <I>Instructions
for the Government of Armies of the United States in the Field</I>. The
&quot;Lieber Code&quot; deals with distinctions between public and private
property; protection of persons, especially of women; protection of property
related to religion, arts, and sciences; and punishment of crimes committed
against civilians in hostile territory. </P>

<P><I>Double Effect or Atrocity?</I> </P>

<P>When civilians are killed as a result of an artillery or air attack
against factories, command and control complexes, or even military barracks,
the loss is lamentable as collateral damage but has been accepted under
international codes of conduct during warfare as a condition of &quot;double
effect.&quot; When a civilian populace is the target, as in the massacre
by Bosnian Serb troops of Muslim inhabitants of Srebrinica during the 1991-95
Balkan War, world opinion should condemn the act outright. The commander
of the offending troops must be held accountable, but, more to the point,
strategic guidance must emphasize avoiding civilian casualties. American
military history has held several leaders accountable for civilian casualties.
In addition to the courts martial of Lieutenant William Calley and Captain
Ernest Medina for their actions at My Lai during the Vietnam War, an earlier
set of proceedings was brought against officers in the Philippine Insurrection.
Brigadier General Jacob Smith, commander of the 6th Separate Brigade, Major
Edwin Glenn, and Lieutenant Preston Brown were all prosecuted for torturing
or killing civilians. Strategic guidance was apparently lacking. </P>

<P>No such accounting befell Great Britain's Archibald Sinclair, Secretary
of State for Air, and Arthur Harris, commander of British Bomber Command,
during World War II, who executed an area bombing campaign that &quot;could
break the spirit of the enemy provided that it was aimed at the working-class
areas of the fifty-eight German towns with a population of more than 100,000
inhabitants each.&quot;[30] Such civilian deaths are not attributable to
&quot;double effect&quot;; here as with victims of terrorism, they are
deliberate targets. </P>

<P>For the bombing of Dresden, British air crews were told their aiming
point was the central railway station, but the lead marker aircraft pointed
&quot;at the Dresden-Friedrichstadt <I>Krankenhaus</I>, the biggest hospital-complex
in Central Germany.&quot;[31] </P>

<P>The adoption of this terror-bombing policy had repercussions both on
postwar international relations and on the nation that conducted it. During
its conduct, parliamentarians recognized an unpalatable form of class warfare,
and even British victims of terror bombing did not support the campaign
by the RAF.[32] Senior leaders in both air and naval components also opposed
the policy, but did so with restraint sufficient to preclude its abandonment.
As with Hiroshima, the bombing of Dresden spawned the establishment of
philanthropic foundations that continue to condemn the deliberate targeting
of civilians as an instrument of war. Postwar repercussions of both the
Asian and European bombing campaigns were not limited to bilateral relations,
but also figured in the East-West confrontation. In the informational dimension
of postwar international relations, the Soviets could argue that the Western
Allies' bombing policy demonstrated we were not the champions of human
rights we purported ourselves to be. In Dresden itself, at the ruins of
a church, a bronze plaque erected under Soviet occupation is a staunch
reminder of the conflagration visited on refugees and inhabitants by an
&quot;Anglo-American&quot; air campaign of terrorism.[33] </P>

<P><B>Strategic Implications</B> </P>

<P>Civil affairs organizations have had their major influence at the operational
level. US ambassadors to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Haiti, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia,
and Turkey, among others, have been highly pleased with the linkages civil
affairs operators have provided between national strategic goals and the
implementation of initiatives through the presence of military forces.
At the theater level, civil affairs organizations have facilitated the
work of various government agencies and nongovernmental organizations in
reaching a desired end-state. But despite success in coordinating the various
resources available to address civil-sector needs, at this level civil
affairs personnel cannot manage the constraints on resources; one simply
discovers them and attempts to work around them. If the US Agency for International
Development, for example, has devised a program to support infrastructure
reconstruction that targets a particular niche, a civil affairs planner
at a strategic headquarters should be able to tell the theater-level civil
affairs task force commander what niche the program fills and what other
resources are available for other sectors. In the absence of such guidance,
the theater civil affairs commander must discover which sectors are addressed
and which are omitted and then search for solutions. Such a situation shows
no evidence of strategic guidance. </P>

<P>In the realm of current operations, the need for strategic guidance
may run in two directions. In meeting the demands for accountability, strategic
commanders must set the tone of their forces' conduct. They may also remind
political leadership of both moral constraints on destruction and the need
for post-conflict reconciliation. The example of Choltitz indicates a sense
among military leaders of propriety in military conduct that sometimes
exceeds that sense on the part of political leadership. This circumstance
might appear odd if one's orientation is that political leaders need to
appeal to the basic values of an electorate. But visceral issues often
evoke eloquence, which in turn can provide excellent camouflage for a moral
void. Thus, national leadership must articulate principles that exploit
enemy vulnerabilities in a way that does not undermine our core values.[34]
</P>

<P><B>Conclusion</B> </P>

<P>Clausewitz has taught generations of senior officers the connection
between military and civil activities undertaken between states. In considering
military ethics, the national command authorities and their senior commanders
must contemplate civil components of their conduct of war. As the Convention
respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land (the 1907 Hague Convention)
describes it, the parties to the convention desired to establish &quot;a
general rule of conduct for the belligerents in their mutual relations
and in their relations with the inhabitants.&quot;[35] The treatment of
inhabitants, including respect for their property, religion, and culture,
falls under <I>jus in bello</I> considerations of the conduct of war. The
following particular considerations are standard features of strategic
civil affairs guidance: </P>

<UL>
<LI>protection of cultural institutions and private property </LI>

<LI>provisions for rightful use of an occupied belligerent's state possessions
</LI>

<LI>requirement for continuation of payment of tax revenue to support municipal
services </LI>

<LI>distinction between public and private property, including the treatment
of religious, charitable, educational, art, and scientific institutions
as private property even when state-supported </LI>

<LI>prohibition of pillage, murder, rape, and wanton destruction </LI>

<LI>prohibition of impressment into service in the conquering forces </LI>

<LI>prohibition of private gain </LI>
</UL>

<P>Such documents may be international conventions, such as the 1907 Hague
Convention cited above, the (unratified) Brussels Convention of 1874 (Project
of an International Declaration concerning the Laws and Customs of War),
and the UNESCO Convention and Protocol for the Protection of Cultural Property
in the Event of Armed Conflict (Hague Convention and Protocol of 1954).
They may be declarations of policy issued by alliances and coalitions,
thus representing the policy of one side to a conflict, such as the 1943
Declaration of London. Or they may be instructions given the commanders
and troops of one belligerent, such as the <I>Swedish Discipline</I> or
the Lieber Code. </P>

<P>Some may object that this essay proposes placing military personnel
above the limits of responsibility of the Department of Defense, charging
them with interagency coordination in the prosecution of an armed conflict.
A further objection may be that this proposal constrains political prerogatives.
Then-Major General Richard Chilcoat points us toward an answer to such
objections in commenting, </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>There is no clear threshold between peace and war marking the point
where political and military leaders hand off responsibility. <I>Both must
be masters of strategic art, and the subordination of military to civilian
leadership does not lessen the importance of military counsel and advice
to political authorities or the responsibilities of both to communicate
and coordinate at every level of strategy and during all phases of conflict.
This is the essence of strategy</I>.[36] </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It is the responsibility of senior military advisors to inform the national
command authorities of appropriate constraints on the conduct of military
operations and of conditions that contribute to peace or conflict. In meeting
national strategic aims, senior military leaders have a perspective that
is not limited to the professional prosecution of war but also applies
to the environment of peace or conflict in which relations among states
take place. </P>

<P>There is a definite role for strategic civil affairs planning at various
levels of government, including the Executive Office of the President,
the National Security Council, several elements in the Office of the Secretary
of Defense, and, in uniformed organizations, at the Joint Staff as well
as on the staffs of theater commanders. Various strategic offices must
be capable of developing and promulgating guidance for the conduct of military
operations ranging from peacetime international relations to peacekeeping
to armed conflict. Across this spectrum, such guidance must address the
relations between military forces and the populace in the area of deployment
and between military activities and political-economic relations among
states. It must also identify the military's contribution to achieving
global and regional strategic aims. </P>
