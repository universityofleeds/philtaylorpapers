<br>
<br> 
<br>Miggins:  [dancing about by a table of two customers in her coffee shop]
<br>	  Oh la la!  [laughs happily]
<br> 
<br>	[Edmund Blackadder, butler to the Prince Regent, enters]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Ah, good morning, Mrs Miggins.
<br> 
<br>Miggins:  Bonjour, monsieur.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  What?
<br> 
<br>Miggins:  Bonjour, monsieur -- it's French.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  So is eating frogs, cruelty to geese and urinating in the street,
<br>	 but that's no reason to inflict it on the rest of us.
<br> 
<br>Miggins:  But French is all the fashion!  My coffee shop is full of
<br>	  frenchies, and it's all because of that wonderful Scarlet
<br>	  Pimpernel.  [an odd squishy noise is heard occasionally,
<br>		       starting now]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  The Scarlet Pimpernel is >not< wonderful, Mrs Miggins.  There is
<br>	 no reason whatsoever to admire someone for filling London with
<br>	 a load of garlic-chewing French toffs crying "Oh la la!" and looking
<br>	 for sympathy all the time just because their fathers had their heads
<br>	 cut off.
<br> 
<br>	 I'll have a cup of coffee and some shepherd's pie, please.
<br> 
<br>Miggins:  [put off]  We don't serve >pies< anymore!  My French clientele
<br>	  consider >pies< uncouth.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  I hardly think that a nation that eats snails and would go to bed
<br>	 with the kitchen sink if it put on a tutu is in any position to
<br>	 preach couthness.
<br> 
<br>	 So what >is< on the menu?  [he picks up the small menu and flips it
<br>	 over looking at it casually]
<br> 
<br>Miggins:  Well, today's hot choice is Chicken Pimpernel in a Scarlet Sauce,
<br>	  Scarlet Chicken in a Pimpernel Sauce, or Huge Suspicious-Looking
<br>	  Sausages in a Scarlet Pimpernel Sauce.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  What exactly is Scarlet Pimpernel sauce?
<br> 
<br>Miggins:  [she uses her hands to demonstrate as she speaks]  You take a large
<br>	  ripe frog, squeeze it [one of the squishy noises is heard as she
<br>	  makes this motion, giving away what the noise is] --
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [putting up a hand]  Yes, yes, all right.  [several words are covered
<br>	 entirely by laughter (anyone out there have a closed-caption decoder,
<br>	 since the commercial-release tapes are closed-captioned?).]
<br> 
<br>	[Edmund goes to the door to leave, just as a Frenchman enters.]
<br> 
<br>Frenchman:  [bowing]  Ah, bonjour, monsieur!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Sod off.
<br> 
<br> 
<br>	[Scene changes to Edmund's quarters, below the prince's house.
<br>	 Baldrick is tearing apart some dough.  Edmund enters, picks up
<br>	 a tabby cat and punts it high into the air across the room.]
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Oh, Sir!  Poor little Mildred the cat!  What's he ever done to you?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  It is the way of the world, Baldrick -- the abused always kick
<br>	 downwards.  I am annoyed, and so I kick the cat... the cat
<br>	 [there is a mouse `eek!' noise] pounces on the mouse, and, finally,
<br>	 the mouse--
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  [startled, jumps]  Agh!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  ...bites you on the behind.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Well, what do I do?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Nothing.  You are last in God's great chain, Baldrick -- unless,
<br>	 of course, there's an earwig around here that you'd like to
<br>	 victimise.
<br> 
<br>	[Baldrick leans toward Edmund, trying to get him to notice something]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [notices]  Baldrick, what's happened to your nose?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Nice, isn't it?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  No it isn't.  It's revolting.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Oh.  I'll take it off, then.  [removes item from his nose]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Baldrick, why are you wearing a false boil?  What are we to expect
<br>	 next: a beauty wart? a cosmetic verruca?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  It's a Scarlet Pimple, Sir.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Really...
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Yeah, they're all the rage down our way.  Everyone wants to
<br>	   express their admiration for the great Pimple and his brilliant
<br>	   disguises.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [takes the pimple, speaks angrily]  What has this fellow done? --
<br>	 apart from pop over to France to grab a few French knobs from the
<br>	 ineffectual clutches [tosses pimple into the fireplace] of some 
<br>	 malnourished whingeing lefties, taking the opportunity while there,
<br>	 no doubt, to pick up some really good cheap wine and some of their
<br>	 marvelous open-fruit flans...
<br> 
<br>	 Doesn't anyone know?  We hate the French!  We fight wars against
<br>	 them!  Did all those men die in vain on the field at Agincourt?
<br>	 Was the man who burned Joan of Arc simply wasting good matches?
<br> 
<br>	[Bells ring.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Ah, His Royal Highness, the Pinhead of Wales, summons me.  You know,
<br>	 I feel almost well-disposed towards him this morning.  Half the
<br>	 chump though he may be, at least he's not French.
<br> 
<br> 
<br>	[Scene changes to inside Prince's bedroom.  He is having some drinks
<br>	 with lords Topper and Smedley.]
<br> 
<br>Prince:  "Un toast! Encore un toast," I say!  Le Pimpernel Scarlette!
<br> 
<br>Topper & Smedley:  Le Pimpernel Scarlette!
<br> 
<br>	[Edmund enters.]
<br> 
<br>Prince:  Ah!  Le Adder Noir!  Come on au in!
<br> 
<br>	[Edmund is upset, but restrains it.]
<br> 
<br>Prince:  [to Topper and Smedley]  This is the fellow to ask, you chaps:
<br>	 my butler -- terribly clever.  Brighter than a brain pie.
<br>	 [Topper and Smedley chuckle like the dandies they are]
<br> 
<br>	 Blackadder, we're trying to guess who the Scarlet Pimpernel is,
<br>	 so we can send him an enormous postal order to express our
<br>	 admiration.  Any ideas?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Well, I'm sure if you addressed the envelope to "The Biggest Show-Off
<br>	 in London," it would reach him eventually.  
<br> 
<br>	[Topper and Smedley stand up from where they were lying (on Prince's
<br>	 bed) and approach Edmund.]
<br> 
<br>Topper:  Tish and pish! Gadzooks! Milarky!  How dare you say such a thing?
<br>	 Damn me, sir, if you're not the worst kind of swine!
<br> 
<br>Smedley:  Damn that swine...
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  I'm sorry, Sir.  I was merely pointing out that sneaking aristocrats
<br>	 out from under the noses of French revolutionaries is about as
<br>	 difficult as putting on a hat.
<br> 
<br>Topper:  Sink me, sir!  This is treason!  The Scarlet Pimpernel's a hero,
<br>	 and the revolution is orchestrated by a ruthless band of highly
<br>	 organised killers, damn them!
<br> 
<br>Smedley:  Damn those organised killers...
<br> 
<br>Topper:  [turning to Prince]  Sir, if I remember rightly, we were just
<br>	 discussing the French Embassy ball in honour of the exiled
<br>	 aristocracy...
<br> 
<br>Prince:  We certainly were -- where I intend the wear the most magnificent
<br>	 pair of trousers ever to issue forth from the delicate hands of
<br>	 Mssrs Snibcock and Turkey, Couturiers to the Very Wealthy and the
<br>	 Extremely Fat.  If the Pimpernel does finally reveal himself, I
<br>	 don't want to get caught out wearing boring trousers!
<br> 
<br>Smedley:  Damn those boring trousers...
<br> 
<br>Topper:  Well, what say we bet your cock-sure domestic a thousand guineas 
<br>	 he can't go to France, rescue an aristocrat, and present him at
<br>	 the ball?
<br> 
<br>	[Edmund looks up.]
<br> 
<br>Topper:  Hah!  That's turned you white, hasn't it?  That's frightened you,
<br>	 you lily-livered, caramel-kidneyed, custard-coloured cad?
<br>	 Not so brilliant now, are you, eh? eh?
<br> 
<br>Smedley:  Eh?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  On the contrary, Sir.  I'll just go and pack.
<br> 
<br>Topper:  Oh.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Perhaps Lord Smedley and Lord Topper will accompany me.  I'm sure
<br>	 it will be a fairly easy trip -- the odd death-defying leap and a
<br>	 modest amount of dental torture...  Want to come?
<br> 
<br>Topper:  [frightened]  Oh, no!
<br> 
<br>Smedley:  Oh, no...
<br> 
<br>Topper:  Damn!
<br> 
<br>Smedley:  Damn...
<br> 
<br>Topper:  Er, any day now, I've got an appointment at my doctor.	 I've got
<br>	 a bit of a sniffle coming on -- I can feel it in my bones.
<br> 
<br>Smedley:  Damn bones, damn bones, damn...
<br> 
<br>Prince:  You know, what about next week?  Oh, come on, you chaps, get your
<br>	 diaries out, come on!
<br> 
<br>Topper:  Oh, all right.  Damn!
<br> 
<br>Smedley:  Damn...
<br> 
<br>Topper:  I left it behind!
<br> 
<br>Smedley:  ...behind...
<br> 
<br>Topper:  ...and, er, besides, I've just remembered: my father's just died!
<br> 
<br>	[Smedley can't say the same thing this time; looks confused.]
<br> 
<br>Topper:  I've got to be at his funeral in ten minutes!  Damn sorry!
<br>	 Goodbye, Your Highness.  [He bows, giving his drink to Edmund.
<br>	 Edmund opens the door and lets him out.]
<br> 
<br>Smedley:  Oh, damn...  I'm the best man.  Damn that dead father, damn...
<br>	  [Gives his drink to Edmund; bows; exits, saying "Bye bye..."]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [beyond the door to the exiting pair]  See you at the ball.
<br> 
<br>Prince:  Oh, what a shame they were so busy.  [walking into the chamber]
<br>	 It would have been lovely to have had them with us.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  "Us"?
<br> 
<br>Prince:  Yes.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  >You're< coming, Sir?
<br> 
<br>Prince:  Well, certainly.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Ah.  [pause]  and nothing I can say about the mind-bending horrors
<br>	 of the revolution could put you off?
<br> 
<br>Prince:  Absolutely not!  Now, come on, Blackadder -- let's get packing.
<br>	 I want to look my best for those fabulous French birds.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Sir, the type of women currently favoured in France are toothless
<br>	 crones who just cackle insanely.
<br> 
<br>Prince:  Oh, ignore that -- they're just playing hard-to-get.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  ...by removing all their teeth, going mad and aging forty years?
<br> 
<br>Prince:  That's right -- the little teasers!  Well, come on!  [he reclines]
<br>	 Erm, I think a blend of silks and satins...
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  I fear not, Sir.  If we are to stand any chance of survival in
<br>	 France, [he rings the servant bell] we shall have to dress as the
<br>	 smelliest lowlife imaginable.
<br> 
<br>Prince:  Oh yes?  What sort of thing?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Well, Sir, let me show you our Paris Collection...
<br> 
<br>	[Baldrick begins walking in from the the outer door.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Baldrick is wearing a sheep's-bladder jacket, with matching
<br>	 dung-ball accessories.  Hair by Crazy Meg of Bedlam [obscured
<br>	 by laughter].  Notice how the overpowering aroma of rotting
<br>	 pilchards has been woven cunningly into the ensemble.
<br> 
<br>	[Edmund approaches Baldrick.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Baldrick, when did you last change your trousers?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  [as if rehearsed]  I have never changed my trousers.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Thank you.  [to Prince]  You see, the ancient Greeks, Sir, wrote
<br>	 in legend of a terrible container in which all the evils of the
<br>	 world were trapped.  How prophetic they were.  All they got wrong
<br>	 was the name.  They called it "Pandora's Box," when, of course,
<br>	 they meant "Baldrick's Trousers."
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  [to Prince]  It certainly can get a bit whiffy, there's no doubt
<br>			about that!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  We are told that, when the box was opened, the whole world turned
<br>	 to darkness because of Pandora's fatal curiousity.  [to Baldrick]
<br>	 I charge you now, Baldrick: for the good of all mankind, never
<br>	 allow curiosity to lead you to open your trousers.  Nothing of
<br>	 interest lies therein.
<br> 
<br>	 [to Prince]  However, Your Highness, it is trousers exactly like
<br>	 these that >you< will have to wear if we are to pass safely into
<br>	 France.
<br> 
<br>Prince:  Mmm, ahem, yes, well, you know, er, on second thought, I think I
<br>	 might give this whole thing a miss.  You know, my tummy's playing
<br>	 up a bit.  Er, wish... wish I could come, but just not poss with
<br>	 this tum.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  I understand perfectly, Sir.
<br> 
<br>Prince:  Also, the chances of me scoring if I look and smell like him
<br>	 are >zeronowgive< it to me, just like in France in the good old days.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Yes, but this is a chance to return to the good old days.
<br> 
<br>Frou Frou:  Oh, how I would love that!  I hate this life!  The food is
<br>	    filthy!  This huge sausage is very suspicious.  If I didn't know
<br>	    better, I'd say it was a horse's wi--
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Yes, yes, yes, all right...  Now, listen; the plan is this:
<br>	 I have a bet on with someone that I can get a Frenchman out
<br>	 of Paris.  I want >you< to be that Frenchman.  All you have to
<br>	 do is come to the embassy with me, say that I rescued you, and
<br>	 then walk away with fifty guineas and all the vol-au-vents
<br>	 you can stuff in your pockets.  What do you say?
<br> 
<br>Frou Frou:  It will be a pleasure!  If there's one thing we aristocrats
<br>	    enjoy, it's a fabulous partie!  Oh, the music! Oh, the laughter!
<br>	    Oh -- if only I'd brought my mongoose costume...
<br> 
<br> 
<br>	[Scene change to the embassy.  It is dank, and some moans of despair
<br>	 can be heard.  Edmund, Frou Frou and Baldrick enter.]
<br> 
<br>Frou Frou:  Yes, well, obviously it hasn't really got going yet...
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  I think that is a bit of an understatement, Frou Frou.  I've been
<br>	 at autopsies with more party atmosphere.
<br> 
<br>Frou Frou:  Don't worry!  In a moment we will hear the sound of music and
<br>	    happy laughter...
<br> 
<br>	[Laughter is heard -- evil maniacal laughter.  A French soldier
<br>	 approaches.]
<br> 
<br>Soldier:  [to Frou Frou]  Bon soir, monsieur.
<br> 
<br>Frou Frou:  Bon soir!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Ah, good evening, my man.  Do you speak English?
<br> 
<br>Soldier:  Little.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Good, well, just take me to the ambassador, then, will you?
<br> 
<br>Soldier:  Pardon?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [articulate]  I have rescued an [pushes the end of his nose up]
<br>	 aristocrat, from [makes claw-like hands] the clutches of the
<br>	 evil revolutionaries.  Please take me to the ambassador.
<br> 
<br>Soldier:  No, I won't.  I >am< an [makes claw hands] "evil revolutionarie,"
<br>	  and have [slices finger across his neck] murdered the [pushes up
<br>	  his nose] ambassadeur, and turned him into [slaps the back and
<br>	  front of one hand against the other, then puts that same hand to
<br>	  his mouth] pate!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Ah.
<br> 
<br>Soldier:  [to Frou Frou]  ...and you, aristo-pig, are trapped!!!
<br> 
<br>Frou Frou:  Peeg? Hah!  You will regret your insolence, revolutionary deug!
<br> 
<br>Solider:  Dog? Hah!  You will regret your arrogance, royalist snake!
<br> 
<br>Frou Frou:  Sneag? Hah!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [stepping in]  Look, I've very sorry to interrupt this very
<br>	 interesting discussion, but it really is none of my business,
<br>	 so I think I'll be on my way.  Come on, Baldrick.
<br> 
<br>Soldier:  [stopping Edmund]  Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah!  Not so fast, English!
<br>	  In rescuing this, eu [motions at Frou Frou], this, eu, boite de
<br>	  stinkyweed, you have attempted to pervert revolutionary justice.
<br>	  Do you know what they do to people who do that?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  They're...given a little present and allowed to go free?
<br> 
<br>Soldier:  No...
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  They're smacked and told not to be naughty, but basically let off...
<br> 
<br>Soldier:  No...
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  [raising his hand]  I think I know.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [quite unhappy and depressed]  What?
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  [quite happy that he knows the answer]  They're put in prison for
<br>	   the night, and brutally guillotined in the morning!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Well done, Baldrick...
<br> 
<br>Soldier:  Your little g'nome is correct, monsieur.  Gentlemen! Welcome
<br>	  to the last day of your life!  [shuts and locks the door]
<br> 
<br> 
<br>	[Scene change to our heroes in a cell, with Soldier outside.]
<br> 
<br>Frou Frou:  How dare you, you filthy weaselle!
<br> 
<br>Solider:  Weasel? Hah!  You're one to talk, aristo-waat-heug!
<br> 
<br>Frou Four:  Warthog? Hah!
<br> 
<br>Soldier:  Hah!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [pulling Frou Frou away from the barred window]  Excuse me,
<br>	 Frou Frou...  [to Soldier]  Look, mate, me old mate...
<br>	 We're both working class; we both hate these rich bastards;
<br>	 I mean, come on, come on, me old mucker, just, just let
<br>	 me go -- you've got nothing against me...
<br> 
<br>Soldier:  On the contrarie!  I >hate< you English with your boring trousers
<br>	  and your shiny toilet paper, and your ridiculous preconception that
<br>	  Frenchmen are great lovers -- [looks both ways, then speaks a bit
<br>	  softly] >I'm< French, and I'm hung like a baby carrot and a couple
<br>	  of petit-pois.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [obscured by laughter]
<br> 
<br>Soldier:  Farewell, "old muckeur," and [shouts] death to the aristoes!!!
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  [joining in happily]  Death to the aristoes!
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Oh, shut up, Mouse-brain...
<br> 
<br>	[Now inside the cell.  Baldrick sits on the bed.]
<br> 
<br>Frou Frou:  Monsieur, why do you waste your words on this scum?
<br>	    Have no fear!  The Scarlet Pimpernel will save us.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Hah!  [knocks Baldrick off the bed; Baldrick falls to the floor, and
<br>	 remains sitting where he lands]  Some hope.  [lies down]
<br>	 The Scarlet Pimpernel is the most overrated human being since
<br>	 Judas Iscariot won the A.D. 31 Best Disciple Competition.
<br> 
<br>Frou Frou:  Well, if he >should< fail us, here: I these have these suicide
<br>	    pills.  One for me [pulls pill out of his ear]; one for you
<br>	    [pulls one out of a nostril]; and one for the dwarf [pulls one
<br>	    out of his bottom -- various silly noises accompany each].
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Say "thank you," Baldrick.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Thank you, Mr Frou.  [puts pill to his mouth; Edmund stops him.]
<br> 
<br>	[The door begins to open.]
<br> 
<br>Frou Frou:  Ah, the Pimpernel!!
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Hurray!
<br> 
<br>Soldier:  [entering]  Ah, the >ambassadorYou're< the fellow who has single-handedly saved all those
<br>	 damned frenchies from the chop?
<br> 
<br>Topper:  Not quite single-handedly, Sir.  I operated with the help of my
<br>	 friend, Smedley, but he seems to have disappeared for the moment,
<br>	 slightly mysteriously.
<br> 
<br>	[Baldrick gets ready to say something.]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Shut up, Baldrick.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  [line obscured by laughter]
<br> 
<br>Prince:  So... So Blackadder rescued the Scarlet Pimpernel!
<br> 
<br>Topper:  No, Sir, he did not.
<br> 
<br>Prince:  Eh?
<br> 
<br>Topper:  Prepare yourself for a story of dishonour and deceit that will make
<br>	 your stomach turn.
<br> 
<br>Prince:  Well, I say!  [to Edmund]  This is interesting, isn't it, Blackadder?
<br> 
<br>	[Edmund nods slowly.]
<br> 
<br>Topper:  Not only that [turning and walking toward Edmund], but I trust it
<br>	 will lead to the imprisonment of a man who is a liar, a bounder,
<br>	 and a cad.
<br> 
<br>	[Baldrick turns to look, with Topper, at Edmund.]
<br> 
<br>	[Edmund turns to look behind himself.]
<br> 
<br>Prince:  Well, bravo! because we hate liars, bounders and cads, don't we,
<br>	 Blackadder?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Generally speaking...yes, Sir.  [begins to serve drinks]
<br>	 But perhaps before Lord Topper starts to talk, he might like
<br>	 a glass of wine.  [he has dropped a suicide pill into Topper's
<br>	 glass]  He's looking a little shaken.
<br> 
<br>Topper:  [taking the glass]  Shaken, but not stirred.  [drinks]
<br>	 [gives glass back to Edmund, who sniffs it]
<br>	 [turns to Prince]
<br>	 It all began last week.  I was sitting in Mrs Miggins' coffee shop
<br>	 when...oh, god!  [holds head in his hands]  All this treachery is
<br>	 so depressing...  [shouts]  I mean, the whole thing just makes you
<br>	 incredibly angry!!!  [swings at Baldrick, missing; Baldrick falls
<br>	 over anyway; then Topper runs over to Prince]  AND IT JUST MAKES
<br>	 YOU WANT TO...oh, that's a nice waistcoat, Your Majesty...
<br>	 er...I'm sorry; I've completely forgotten what I was talking about.
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  [grinning]  Erm, a story of dishonour and deceit...
<br> 
<br>Topper:  [smiles]  Oh! That's a great story!  That's great!!
<br>	 Oh, that's a WONDERFUL STORY!!!  Let me just jump into
<br>	 this corner first.  [jumps into corner; dies]
<br> 
<br>Prince:  [standing]  Roast my raisins!  He's popped it!  I say, Blackadder,
<br>	 do you think he really was the Scarlet Pimpernel?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Well, judging from the ridiculous ostentatiousness of his death,
<br>	 I would say that he was.
<br> 
<br>Prince:  Well, then, that's a damn shame, because I wanted to give him this
<br>	 enormous postal order.  [holds it up]
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Please, Sir, let me finish.  I would say that he was...>n'tyou've< just been to France,
<br>	 and you've rescued a French aristocrat...  Oh, Blackadder!
<br>	 Are you the Scarlet Pimpernel?
<br> 
<br>Edmund:  Absolutely not, Sir.
<br> 
<br>Baldrick:  Hurray!
<br> 
<br>	[Prince, too excited for words, hands the postal order to Edmund,
<br>	 who already has his hand waiting to take it.]
