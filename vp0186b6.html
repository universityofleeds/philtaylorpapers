<br>> Plan stresses 'listening as much as transmitting
<br>> DRAFT DOD STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION CONCEPT EYES SMITH-MUNDT ACT
<br>> 
<br>> Inside the Pentagon, May 29, 2008
<br>> 
<br>> 
<br>> The U.S. military's draft concept for how commanders should carry out
<br>> strategic communication within a broader national effort circa 2016 to
<br>> 2028 proposes revising American antipropaganda laws.
<br>> 
<br>> The draft document asserts American statutes barring the release of
<br>> information from "certain military resources" to U.S. audiences may
<br>> need to be updated.
<br>> 
<br>> The 1948 Smith-Mundt Act, prohibiting domestic distribution of
<br>> information intended for foreign audiences, is based on "an outdated
<br>> model of global communication," U.S. Joint Forces Command argues.
<br>> 
<br>> "The principle of not misleading domestic audiences remains valid --
<br>> in fact, misleading any audience is unusually counterproductive in the
<br>> long run -- but this could be achieved by other ways than arbitrarily
<br>> prohibiting any domestic use of some capabilities," the concept
<br>> states.
<br>> 
<br>> The draft document also reinforces "listening as much as
<br>> transmitting," which is in sync with recent guidance from Chairman of
<br>> the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Michael Mullen.
<br>> 
<br>> Inside the Pentagon reviewed the April 25 draft of the strategic
<br>> communication joint integrating concept, or JIC. JFCOM expects the
<br>> Joint Requirements Oversight Council to approve the concept in
<br>> September.
<br>> 
<br>> JFCOM's J-9 concepts groups, U.S. Special Operations Command and U.S.
<br>> Strategic Command are working together in this effort, which was
<br>> spearheaded by the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review execution roadmap
<br>> for strategic communication.
<br>> 
<br>> Also involved are the combatant commands, the services, the Joint
<br>> Staff, the Office of the Secretary of Defense and other Pentagon
<br>> agencies.
<br>> 
<br>> Dated April 25, the briefing argues there will be "no separate
<br>> strategic communication process in the future, but that strategic
<br>> communication will be inherent in the planning and conduct of all
<br>> operations."
<br>> 
<br>> The notion is in line with a Dec. 14, 2007, memo, in which Mullen
<br>> advocated making the transition to embedded strategic communication
<br>> thinking and planning across the Defense Department. The United States
<br>> must focus less on promoting its own story globally and more on
<br>> listening to Muslims worldwide and understanding the subtleties of
<br>> that community, writes Mullen (ITP, Jan. 10, p1).
<br>> 
<br>> The JIC spends a great deal of time discussing the idea of influence,
<br>> which it defines as "convincing others to think and act in ways
<br>> compatible with our objectives, whether this means causing others to
<br>> adopt a specific course of action or simply understand us better and
<br>> accept us more."
<br>> 
<br>> Influence may cover a range of activities such as simple informing,
<br>> educating, persuading, urging, inducing and coercing, according to the
<br>> brief.
<br>> 
<br>> The term sometimes carries negative connotations -- particularly when
<br>> a friend or ally is the object of the influence -- because the term is
<br>> often associated with deceptive manipulation or exploitation usually
<br>> exercised against that person's best interests, it explains. But, the
<br>> authors argue, the word influence under the draft concept lacks this
<br>> connotation.
<br>> 
<br>> "Influence is a pervasive and fundamental form of any social
<br>> interaction, as essential to cooperation as it is to competition or
<br>> conflict," states the JFCOM brief.
<br>> 
<br>> In the future, the challenge of influence will be critical because
<br>> "success in the globally interconnected information environment will
<br>> frequently be less a matter of imposing one's will and more a matter
<br>> of ideas and example," the brief states. "Joint forces today are not
<br>> as effective as they will need to be at meeting this challenge
<br>> successfully."
<br>> 
<br>> A joint forces commander operating in the 2016 to 2028 time frame will
<br>> employ a range of informational and other capabilities to identify,
<br>> segment, study and listen to potential audiences, the authors write.
<br>> 
<br>> The commander must conceive, produce and coordinate signals through
<br>> both information and actions designed to affect the perceptions,
<br>> attitudes, beliefs and behaviors of selected audiences in ways
<br>> supporting the mission and promoting broader national interests, the
<br>> concept states. He or she must also monitor, measure and assess the
<br>> effects of these signals.
<br>> 
<br>> Finally, the commander will have to modify action and information
<br>> based on feedback on the effects of the signals.
<br>> 
<br>> Although strategic communication will not appear dramatically
<br>> different than it is today, the "psychological impact will be central
<br>> in all operational planning and execution to the degree that strategic
<br>> communication will no longer even be recognized as a distinct
<br>> discipline," states the document.
<br>> 
<br>> Moreover, it says, intelligence will change significantly to support
<br>> the needs of strategic communication, stressing the collection and
<br>> analysis of information on the perceptions, attitudes and beliefs of
<br>> potential audiences. These do not qualify as traditional intelligence
<br>> targets, it adds.
<br>> 
<br>> The draft concept suggests more "deliberative and proactive" strategic
<br>> communication in the future will allow commanders to better anticipate
<br>> developments and have "on-call" communication plans in place.
<br>> 
<br>> A heavy focus on assessment will also figure into this new brand of
<br>> strategic communication, according to the concept.
<br>> 
<br>> Once the concept is adopted, communications will be "more
<br>> discriminate, more cohesive, more adaptive, faster and more
<br>> decentralized," the authors say.
<br>> 
<br>> Implementing the plan will require several key capabilities.
<br>> 
<br>> Commanders need to be able to access, produce and maintain
<br>> intelligence and other knowledge on the perceptions, attitudes and
<br>> beliefs of potential audiences.
<br>> 
<br>> Commanders must be able to access, produce and maintain intelligence
<br>> on complex social communication systems, including the characteristics
<br>> of media channels and the intentions, capabilities and efforts of
<br>> other "influencers" within and having an effect on the joint
<br>> operations area.
<br>> 
<br>> To bring the concept into effect, commanders should detect, monitor,
<br>> translate and assess the effects of the strategic communication
<br>> efforts on friendly governments, non-state groups, neutrals,
<br>> competitors and adversaries, the concept says.
<br>> 
<br>> Moreover, these future leaders must be able to estimate the direct and
<br>> indirect effects of potential signals on the perceptions, attitudes,
<br>> beliefs and actions of selected audiences, the authors write.
<br>> 
<br>> Other important skills will include conceiving and formulating
<br>> "timely, resonant . . . and culturally attuned messages" to sway
<br>> selected audiences; producing and delivering information to influence
<br>> selected audiences; conceiving and coordinating physical actions or
<br>> maintaining physical capabilities to influence selected audiences;
<br>> extensively documenting joint force actions; and monitoring, measuring
<br>> and assessing the impact of "friendly signals" on audiences in
<br>> relation to expected effects.
<br>> 
<br>> Finally, it will be necessary for these commanders to integrate all
<br>> joint force actions to maximize desired effects on selected audiences,
<br>> and coordinate joint forces actions with the influence efforts of
<br>> other agencies and partners within the context of a broader national
<br>> strategy, the draft states.
<br>> 
<br>> There are, however, risks and implications linked to adopting this
<br>> concept, as spelled out in the document.
<br>> 
<br>> For example, it argues, the concept establishes deep understanding of
<br>> potential audiences and social communication networks as the necessary
<br>> basis for effective communication.
<br>> 
<br>> "This type and level of understanding may prove unattainable,"
<br>> according to the JFCOM document. "This said, there is no minimum level
<br>> of understanding required to execute this concept. However, the
<br>> quality of any communication effort will vary directly with the level
<br>> of understanding."
<br>> 
<br>> The key to lessen this risk is to improve the process of building
<br>> situational awareness -- primarily through doctrine, training and
<br>> education -- with respect to audience perceptions, attitudes and
<br>> beliefs, it states.
<br>> 
<br>> The greatest implications to instituting the concept will fall in the
<br>> areas of doctrine, leader development and intelligence, according to
<br>> the draft concept.
<br>> 
<br>> Wrapping up their discussion of a new brand of strategic
<br>> communication, the authors offer an imaginary scenario where the
<br>> policy is applied to the southwest Pacific region of Mesonesia.
<br>> 
<br>> An economically vibrant and politically dynamic "Pacific Tiger," the
<br>> region is religiously and ethnically diverse in 2016.
<br>> 
<br>> Although the United States and Mesonesia have never been close, the
<br>> U.S. administration decides the "conditions are right for détente" and
<br>> embarks on a plan from 2016 to 2020 to increase understanding and
<br>> improve relations between the two countries, as outlined in the
<br>> document.
<br>> 
<br>> The authors explain this means "improving the U.S. brand image" in
<br>> Mesonesia, as well as throughout the entire region, and preventing the
<br>> global Islamist insurgency from gaining influence in Mesonesia.
<br>> 
<br>> Strategic communication will play a significant role in this strategy, they
<br>> say.
<br>> 
<br>> The U.S. Information Agency -- reestablished in this imaginary
<br>> scenario -- will coordinate the national effort, while U.S. Pacific
<br>> Command will play a supporting role, the document states.
<br>> 
<br>> "Because opinion polling indicates strong distrust of the U.S.
<br>> military among most Mesonesians, the joint application of strategic
<br>> communication purposely remains in the background and is rarely
<br>> distinguishable from the broader effort," the document says.
<br>> 
<br>> In addition, all strategic communication activities of PACOM will be
<br>> conducted under the guidance of the Mesonesia Interagency Working
<br>> Group, which includes U.S. government agency membership.
<br>> 
<br>> The United States also provides security training, foreign assistance,
<br>> engineering support, participation in international exercises,
<br>> expanded exchange programs and regional security conferences.
<br>> 
<br>> In his regular guidance to commanders, the fictional PACOM commander
<br>> argues the United States is sometimes too focused on getting its
<br>> message out.
<br>> 
<br>> "We've got to listen more and transmit less," the fictional commander
<br>> writes, echoing Mullen. "More dialogue, less lecturing." -- Fawzia
<br>> Sheikh
