<br>Iraq Media Timeline
<br>
<br>Before (and during) the invasion of Iraq - The U.S. government broadcasts psychological warfare programming into Iraq from an EC-130E Commander Solo aircraft (a modified C130 cargo plane). (Asia Times, 8/16/03)
<br>
<br>January 16, 2003 - Defense Department offices for special operations and low-intensity conflict and for Near Eastern and South Asian affairs (special plans), issue a White Paper/briefing calling for a "Rapid Reaction Media Team" to set up an "Iraqi Free Media" after the overthrow of the government in Baghdad.
<br>
<br>February 2003 - C. Ryan Henry, corporate vice president for strategic assessment and development for the San Diego-based defense contractor Scientific Applications International Corporation (SAIC), leaves to become deputy to Douglas Feith, head of the Defense Department's policy office. (OUSD(P) Web site, Ryan Henry biography)
<br>
<br>March 5, 2003 - The Pentagon gives a no-bid $33 million contract to SAIC for the Iraqi Reconstruction and Development Council (IRDC), a group of exiles put together by Paul Wolfowitz. (Acquisition, 3/18/04; San Diego Union-Tribune, 7/4/04)
<br>
<br>March 11, 2003 - The Defense Department gives SAIC a $15 million sole-source contract for the "Iraqi Free Media" project. Though the company has worked extensively with U.S. Special Forces, it has no media experience. The contract is under Douglas Feith's purview.
<br>
<br>(SAIC's vice chairman, Admiral William Owens (Ret.), was a member of the Defense Policy Board, advising Donald Rumsfeld. The company's board members include Gen. Wayne Downing (Ret.), who also worked on domestic and international business development for the company, and was a member of the board of The Committee for the Liberation of Iraq. Soon after SAIC hired him, according to The San Diego Union-Tribune, "Downing became a vocal advocate for overthrowing Saddam Hussein, becoming a part-time lobbyist and military planner for Iraqi dissident Adnan Chalabi's Iraqi National Congress.")
<br>
<br>("In 1997, Downing drafted a detailed plan for invading Iraq, spearheaded by Iraqi insurgents with the help of 5,000 or 6,000 special operations forces . . . . Gen. Anthony Zinni [U.S. military commander for the Middle East] mocked it as 'the Bay of Goats'," evoking the U.S. Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961.)
<br>
<br>(Until mid-2002 Downing worked for the George W. Bush administration as an NSC counterterrorism expert.) (Acquisition, 3/18/04; Asia Times, 8/16/03; Washington Post, 10/16/03; Village Voice, 11/12/03; San Diego Union-Tribune, 7/4/04)
<br>
<br>Around March 11, 2003 - Robert Reilly, former head of the Voice of America, is hired to be project director for the Iraqi Media Network (IMN). Reilly worked for the Reagan administration as a liaison to Catholics, and as a publicist for the Nicaraguan contras. He was a member of the Center for Security Policy, whose credo was "peace through American strength." Other members included Donald Rumsfeld, Richard Perle, Doug Feith, Elliott Abrams, Midge Dector, and Frank Gaffney. One of Reilly's publications posited an inherent incompatibility between Islamic theology and Western values.
<br>
<br>Mike Furlong, who did military media work after the Kosovo war, is hired as Reilly's deputy and the Iraqi Media Network's program manager. (Reporters Without Borders Web site, 7/22/03; Center for Security Policy Web site)
<br>
<br>March 20, 2003 - The U.S. invades Iraq.
<br>
<br>March 21, 2003 - An email from a Defense Department contracting specialist indicates that someone from the Office for Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA), the entity initially created by the Pentagon to rule Iraq, wants SAIC to hire four named individuals, including Shaha Ali Riza, as Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) for advice regarding voter education, business development, politics, women, and government reform. (Acquisition, 3/18/04; Contract No. DASW01-03-F-0537)
<br>
<br>March 27, 2003 - SAIC is awarded an $834,744 contract for an "Advisor for Democracy and Governance Group," including Shaha Ali Riza. (In April 2007 it is revealed that Paul Wolfowitz, in response to nepotism rules evoked when he became director of the World Bank, arranged for Riza, his significant other, to be posted to the State Department and to be granted several large raises, increasing her salary to more than $193,000.) (Acquisition, 3/18/04; Government Accountability Project Web site, 4/5/07)
<br>
<br>March 29, 2003 - British tanks fire on four al-Jazeera journalists filming food distribution in Basra. (Reporters Without Borders Web site,4/8/03)
<br>
<br>March 30, 2003 - U.S. forces hit Iraq's Ministry of Information with a cruise missile, damaging the building and destroying satellite dishes. (Central Command News Release, 3/30/2003, Independent on Sunday (London), 3/30/03)
<br>
<br>April 6, 2003 - American troops kill Qomran Abdul Razzaq, a BBC translator, when they bomb a Kurdish convoy in northern Iraq. (Brussels Tribunal Web site)
<br>
<br>April 7, 2003 - U.S. forces fire on an al-Jazeera vehicle, prominently marked "press", on a road near Baghdad. (Reporters Without Borders Web site, 4/8/03)
<br>
<br>April 8, 2003 - A U.S. tank fires on Baghdad's Palestine Hotel and kills Reuters cameraman Taras Protsyuk and Spanish Telecinco cameraman Jose Couso. (Associated Press, 4/19/04)
<br>
<br>April 8, 2003 - A U.S. missile hits al-Jazeera's Baghdad bureau and kills reporter Tariq Ayoub. The Pentagon had been extensively briefed on the bureau's location, which was festooned with barriers marked "TV". (MEED Weekly Special Report, 2/20/04)
<br>
<br>April 10, 2003 - Ahmed al-Rikaby, hired by SAIC to be the Iraqi Media Network's first television director, broadcasts the announcement "Welcome to the new Iraq" from a tent erected by U.S. soldiers. Five days later, "The Voice of New Iraq" officially begins broadcasting on AM radio. (Associated Press, 8/6/03; Christian Science Monitor, 4/21/03)
<br>
<br>May 13, 2003 - The Iraqi Media Network begins television broadcasting from Baghdad, featuring cartoons, Egyptian soap operas, folk singers, news, sports, and interviews about Iraq's lack of security and services. (Associated Press, 5/25/03)
<br>
<br>May 15, 2003 - PR Week reports SAIC's launching of the newspaper as-Sabah, with an initial run of 50,000. Its "short-term goal is to quell unrest among Iraqis by establishing America's presence and control over basic issues. The San Diego-based information-technology firm holds a Pentagon-issued contract to set up a media operation in post-war Iraq in coordination with Psychological Operations and the White House communications staff." (PR Week (US), 5/19/03)
<br>
<br>June 2003 - Administrator Paul Bremer of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), successor to ORHA, issues Order No. 6, declaring that the Iraqi Media Network is an interim entity replacing Iraq's information ministry, eliminated by occupation authorities in May. IMN is given the ministry's equipment and facilities. It retains a few hundred reporters and other staff. More than 5,000 employees are fired.
<br>
<br>Along with the newspaper as-Sabah, the Iraqi Media Network operates a television station and two radio stations. The network's chief editor, former Iraqi-Canadian exile George Mansour, says its news bulletins are independent. In reality they feature coalition activities and statements by Bremer. Mansour insists his journalists are "genuine" Iraqis, but some mock its reporters' American and British accents. (Reporters Without Borders Web site, 4/26/07)
<br>
<br>June 2003 - Independent press watchdog groups issue a report calling for the Iraqi Media Network to be dismantled because it is unclear whether it is to be an independent media outlet or a propaganda tool. Controversies include the hiring of Hero Talabani, wife of Kurdish leader/USG ally Jalal Talabani, to oversee editing, and its daily airing of a British program called "Toward Freedom." The latter issue has led five Iraqi Media Network officials to write to managers installed by SAIC: "We respectfully request to know whose political agenda is involved here. Certainly, it is not a professionally sound programming decision to use a mediocre propaganda program from abroad to supercede our own news program. Following an exhausting hour of 'Toward Freedom,' it is only the most dedicated news junkies who could tolerate it without seeking another channel." (Baghdad Bulletin, July 21, 2003)
<br>
<br>June 2003 - Iraqi Media Network staff are not paid and go on strike. They strike again upon learning their pay scale will be that of the former Ministry of Information -- $120 a month. A senior advisor to the IMN, former NBC correspondent Don North, says, "For some reason CPA have said we must adhere to the old pay scheme" despite intense competition for competent staff. (U.S. contractors hired for management positions are paid more than $200 per hour.) (Baghdad Bulletin, July 21, 2003)
<br>
<br>June 2003 - Robert Reilly leaves the Iraqi Media Network, suddenly. (Washington Post, 10/16/03)
<br>
<br>June 2003 - Iraqi Media Network program manager Mike Furlong is fired. (Baghdad Bulletin, July 21, 2003)
<br>
<br>August 5, 2003 - Iraqi Media Network's TV director, Ahmed al-Rikaby, quits, saying the network is inadequately funded and can't compete with al-Jazeera and other alternative news sources. Al-Rikaby's one-year contract to be television director and head of radio programs was scheduled to end in April 2004. He says low pay has led staff to leave the network. (Associated Press, 8/6/03)
<br>
<br>August 10, 2003 - The Daily Telegraph, a conservative British paper, reports that former colleagues of Ahmed al-Rikaby say that Iraqi TV's problems arose from incompetence and nepotism, and that his claims of inadequate funding "should not be taken seriously." Al-Rikaby declares that he's been targeted by "a smear campaign," and says, "There was always an excuse as to why I couldn't get what I needed." (The Daily Telegraph, 8/10/03)
<br>
<br>August 17, 2003 - U.S. soldiers kill Mazen Dana, a Palestinian journalist working for Reuters, while he is filming outside Abu Ghraib prison. (IPS, 9/25/03)
<br>
<br>September 2003 - Dorrance Smith becomes media consultant to the CPA and head of the Iraqi Media Network. A childhood friend of George Bush and former producer for This Week with David Brinkley, he left ABC in 1989 to become media advisor to George H.W. Bush. He worked at This Week again from 1995 to 1999, when he was reportedly forced out, shortly before ABC decided not to renew the contract of commentator William Kristol. Kristol, a Smith colleague from the first Bush White House, was a principal cheerleader for the invasion of Iraq. (Media Research Center Web site, 12/30/99)
<br>
<br>September 23, 2003 - Iraq's governing council bars leading Arab satellite TV stations al-Jazeera and al-Arabiya from its ministries and events. The Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders condemn the decision. IPS reports that the Iraqi Media Network has taken over a number of Iraqi radio stations and effectively shut down independent media outlets. (IPS, 9/25/03)
<br>
<br>September 24, 2003 - U.S. soldiers open fire on AP photographer Karim Kadhim and his driver Qassim as-Saidi, and rake their car, prominently labeled "Press", with machine gunfire. The reporters escape death by leaping from the car. (IPS, 9/25/03)
<br>
<br>September 30, 2003 - According to the Defense Department's inspector general, SAIC's initial $15 million contract for the Iraqi Free Media Program is now valued at $82.3 million: "approximately 71 percent of the costs were materials." (Department of Defense; Office of the Inspector General: Acquisition, March 18, 2004, p. 10)
<br>
<br>October 2003 - The Pentagon begins soliciting bids for a new $200 million contract to run the Iraqi Media Network. (Village Voice, 11/12/03)
<br>
<br>October 16, 2003 - The Washington Post reports that Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) wants to transfer $100 million meant to expand Iraq's media network from the Pentagon to the State Department; however, the DOD's Office for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict (in charge of psychological operations) retains control. (Washington Post, 10/16/03; Village Voice, 11/12/03)
<br>
<br>October 22, 2003 - Japan's foreign ministry announces that the 1980s TV drama "Oshin", called a "tearjerker" by some, will be broadcast by the Iraqi Media Network. A Japanese official hopes that "the patience, enthusiasm and forward-looking attitude of Oshin, the story's heroine, will send out a positive message to the Iraqi people." (Japan Economic Newswire, 10/22/03)
<br>
<br>Early November 2003 - George Mansour is removed as the Iraqi Media Network's news director. (Village Voice, 11/12/03)
<br>
<br>November 3, 2003 - U.S. troops seize al-Jazeera cameraman Salah Hassan near Baquba, as he is interviewing witnesses to a roadside bomb attack, and take him to a U.S. military base, then to Abu Ghraib. He is eventually released without charge. (Observer, 11/27/05; Reporters Without Borders Web site)
<br>
<br>November 12, 2003 -The Village Voice reports that a recent poll found that 67 percent of Iraqis with satellite receivers prefer TV news from al-Arabiya or al-Jazeera - not the Iraqi Media Network. (Village Voice, 11/12/03)
<br>
<br>November 13, 2003 - The New York Observer reports that the CPA, dissatisfied with U.S. news coverage of Iraq, is about to create its own 24-hour broadcast operation, bypassing American networks. "It's C-Span Baghdad", according to CPA media advisor Dorrance Smith.
<br>
<br>The article says that the U.S. military in Iraq and the CPA press office, described by one news producer "as staffed by political true believers, 'neocons and evangelists'," were "'apoplectic' at the press for under-reporting the 'good news' in Iraq." (New York Observer, 11/13/03)
<br>
<br>January 7, 2004 - The satellite broadcaster Arabsat, based in U.S.-friendly Saudi Arabia, begins broadcasting Iraqi Media Network's al-Iraqiya TV programs. According to Radio Netherlands, "After the American attack on Iraq the management of both Arabsat and Nilesat announced that they w[ould] not let the Iraqi Media Network to be broadcast on both satellites but sounds like they gave it a second thought . . ." (BBC Monitoring International Reports, 1/7/04)
<br>
<br>January 9, 2004 - After deciding not to renew SAIC's contract to run the Iraqi Media Network, the Defense Department replaces it with the Harris Corp., a military contractor based in Melbourne, Florida. The company announces, "the Defense Contracting Command-Washington (DCC-W), on behalf of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) currently governing Iraq," has given it a renewable $96 million to develop Iraq's "antiquated" media network. The total value of the contract could be nearly $165 million. Its "local teammates" will be the Christian-owned Lebanese Broadcasting Corp. and telecommunications company al-Fawares of Kuwait. (Harris Corp. Web site, 4/27/2007)
<br>
<br>January 20, 2004 - In his State of the Union speech, President Bush says, "To cut through the barriers of hateful propaganda, the Voice of America and other broadcast services are expanding their programming in Arabic and Persian - and soon, a new television service will begin providing reliable news and information across the region." (White House Web site, 1/20/04)
<br>
<br>February 14, 2004 - With $62 million, the U.S. government launches al-Hurra, a network intended to compete with al-Jazeera, to broadcast news and entertainment to Arab countries from a base in Springfield, Virginia. According to the National Post (Canada), Washington has allocated an additional $40 million for a specifically Iraqi al-Hurra operation [which begins broadcasting in April 2004.] Its programs are to be modeled after Radio Sawa, a pop music outlet that the USG considers a relative success.
<br>
<br>According to the Post, "The Pentagon-run Iraq Media Network has flopped. Iraqis have not warmed to its broadcasts of official statements by Paul Bremer, the U.S. administrator, and members of the Iraqi Governing Council." (National Post (Canada), 12/19/03)
<br>
<br>February 14, 2004 - Former CPA contractor and Iraqi Media Network senior advisor Don North says professional journalism training was obviously needed in Iraq - "A brutal form of training was delivered by the U.S. Army and CPA officials when they found stories offensive. They visited the offices of offending newspapers and often left them padlocked and in ruins. No mediation, no appeal."
<br>
<br>He says the Iraqi Media Network's problems had many causes, including the fact that, "A revolving door of officials with no credible television or journalism experience dictated plans and policy to IMN."
<br>
<br>Also, "A surprising lack of operating capital, in spite of IMN's being the most expensive U.S. government media project in history at an estimated $4 million a month, forced the IMN to run on a shoestring and look like it. There were no funds for basic equipment such as camera batteries, tripods or editing equipment. A $500 request for a satellite dish to downlink the Reuters news feed was refused. A $200 request for printing my training manual in Arabic for reporters was turned down."
<br>
<br>Also, "Lack of planning for program production or acquisition resulted in illegal airing of copyrighted European and Hollywood film tapes confiscated from the mansion of Saddam's son Uday."
<br>
<br>Also, "IMN staff were ordered to cover endless daily CPA news conferences, interviews and photo opportunities, leaving little time and few facilities to cover genuine news stories initiated by IMN reporters on the street."
<br>
<br>Also, "The right of 'collective bargaining,' another American concept, was trashed by CPA management when IMN staff twice went on strike for higher wages. IMN staff were told in effect, 'our way or the highway'." (Senate Democratic Policy Committee Hearing, 2/14/05; Don North statement)
<br>
<br>February 15, 2004 - Harris Corp. takes over the operation of the Iraqi Media Network from SAIC. Eleven months after SAIC was given a contract that was ultimately valued at $82.3 million, an official from one of Harris's two regional subcontracters, Lebanese broadcasting Corporation International, says, "We are practically starting from scratch." (MEED Weekly Special Report, 2/20/04)
<br>
<br>March 3, 2004 - U.S. troops kill al-Jazeera editor-in-chief Mahmood Awad Hamadi in Falluja. (Brussels Tribunal Web site)
<br>
<br>March 18, 2004 - Near a checkpoint, U.S. troops kill correspondent Ali al-Khatib and cameraman Ali Abdel-Aziz of the Dubai-based al-Arabiya news station. (Associated Press, 4/19/04)
<br>
<br>March 18, 2004 - Nadia Nasrat, announcer, Majeed Rasheed, technician, and Mohammed Ahmad Sarhan, security agent of the Iraqi Media Network, are killed by armed men in Diyala (Baquba). (Brussels Tribunal Web site)
<br>
<br>March 18, 2004 - The Defense Department's inspector general issues a report on CPA contracts. It says that SAIC's original program manager for the Iraqi Media Network bought a H2 Hummer and a Ford pickup truck and chartered a DC-10 cargo jet to fly them to Iraq for his personal use "outside the scope of the contract." When the Pentagon's contracting office refused to authorize the purchases, SAIC "went around the authority of this acquisition specialist to a different office within the under secretary of defense for policy to gain approval and succeeded." The inspector general could not specifically determine the cost but one category of expenses called "Office & Vehicle" totaled $381,000.
<br>
<br>Also, when a subject specialist did not win a USAID contract, the director of the ORHA arranged for him to be covered by SAIC's Iraqi Media Network contract. He "was first placed in charge of determining how to dispose of garbage in Iraq, and was then made Senior Ministry Advisor for the Ministry of Youth and Sport. Neither of those roles was within the scope of the Iraqi Free media contract." ORHA's director wrote, "we anticipate . . . [the subject matter expert] would be used on a variety of special projects essentially outside of the Indigenous media contract's scope of work." 
<br>
<br>The inspector general concluded, "We could not determine how the contracting officer obtained a fair and reasonable price for the Iraqi Free Media contract." (Department of Defense; Office of the Inspector General: Acquisition, March 18, 2004, pp. 18, 21)
<br>
<br>March 26, 2004 - U.S. troops kill ABC cameraman Burhan Mohammed Mazhoor in Falluja. (Brussels Tribunal Web site)

<br>April 19, 2004 - The St. Petersburg Times reports that development work on the Iraqi Media Network's al-Iraqiya and other media projects "has come to a near halt in recent days as Harris and other companies have been in lockdown because of the violence. Even with armed guards and armored vehicles, [project director David] Sedgley has been unable to move more than a mile or so beyond the Green Zone . . ."
<br>
<br>The Times notes that Harris won the Pentagon contract to run the Iraqi Media Network through its "one-man Iraqi Initiatives project." Because "it knew nothing about programming," it subcontracted "a non-controversial Arab network," and Newsweek's Kuwaiti printer. (St. Petersburg Times, 4/19/04)
<br>
<br>April 19, 2004 - On a road leading to Samarra, U.S. troops shoot and kill correspondent As'ad Kadhim and driver Hussein Saleh, and wound cameraman Bassem Kamel, employees of the Pentagon-funded al-Iraqiya TV station. (Associated Press, 4/19/04)

<br>
<br>He also says one of Harris's objectives is to develop "fair and balanced" broadcasts, and that it has "reduced the amount of pro-American subjects" being aired.
<br>
<br>Regarding security, he says, "If we knew it was going to deteriorate to today's situation, I would have recommended to my management not to bid this program." (St. Petersburg Times, 2/20/05)
