<br>
<br>(2) An independent investigation revealed that the Department of Education paid a conservative commentator to speak in support of the No Child Left Behind Act during his television and radio appearances.

<br>(3) The American public has been subjected to receiving millions of dollars worth of messages in print, television, radio, and in person without being informed that the sources are not independent.

<br>(4) There is not enough information about Federal public relations and advertising efforts to allow for consistent oversight by Congress.

<br>(1) to ensure that advertising and public relations campaigns paid for with Federal appropriations are unbiased and factual, and do not contain a political message or covert propaganda ;
<br>
<br>(2) to increase the oversight and evaluation of advertising campaigns paid for by the Federal Government by requiring that agencies provide notice to the appropriate congressional committees of all public relations, media relations, and advertising contracts;
<br>
<br>(3) to require that all public relations and media outreach tools developed by Federal agencies inform the target audience of the source of funding for the message; and
