FEATURE - Poland broadcasts "truth" to Belarus
<br>By Chris Johnson
<br>January 15, 2007
<br>
<br>BIALYSTOK, Poland (Reuters) - From simple back 
<br>offices in a provincial Polish town, a radio 
<br>station is broadcasting around the clock to 
<br>Belarus, giving the ex-Soviet republic one of its 
<br>few sources of independent news.
<br>
<br>Run by opponents of Belarus President Alexander 
<br>Lukashenko, Radio Racja (Truth) is helping wage 
<br>an information war against a regime branded by 
<br>U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as "Europe's last dictatorship".
<br>
<br>Supported by the Polish Foreign Ministry and 
<br>Budapest-based Open Society Institute founded by 
<br>U.S. billionaire investor George Soros, Radio 
<br>Racja is one of only two independent stations broadcasting freely into Belarus.
<br>
<br>The station uses Web technology to mix popular 
<br>music and social commentary with uncensored news 
<br>in both Belarussian and Russian, aiming to 
<br>provide a platform for both opposition parties 
<br>and Belarussian bands, some of which are banned at home.
<br>
<br>"I dream of a free and independent Belarus," says 
<br>editor-in- chief Wiktor Stachwiuk, a 58-year-old 
<br>exile. "I want to give Belarussians a taste of a 
<br>free society. Official media do not let them hear what is really going on."
<br>
<br>Lukashenko, in power since 1994, keeps a tight 
<br>rein on the eastern European country and its 10 
<br>million inhabitants, sandwiched between Poland and Russia.
<br>
<br>He rejects all criticism of his rule and has 
<br>called for vigilance to keep Belarus safe from 
<br>Western "lies and violence". Opposition 
<br>politicians and journalists have disappeared and 
<br>all media outlets face serious restrictions.
<br>
<br>Western countries accuse Lukashenko of systematic 
<br>crackdowns on the opposition and dismiss all 
<br>Belarus elections over the last decade as unfair. 
<br>They say the president blatantly rigged elections 
<br>last year to engineer a landslide win for himself.
<br>
<br>"I could not simply stand by and watch what was 
<br>happening in my country without doing anything," 
<br>Stachwiuk said. He first set up Radio Racja in 
<br>1999 and it broadcast from the Polish capital of Warsaw until 2002.
<br>
<br>INTIMIDATION
<br>
<br>His Warsaw station eventually ran into financial 
<br>problems and it took Stachwiuk and his associates 
<br>three more years to raise enough money to launch 
<br>the station in Bialystok, closer to Belarus and 
<br>able to broadcast deeper into the country.
<br>
<br>It now has a budget of $1 million a year, half of 
<br>which is spent on transmitters: two in Poland and two in Lithuania.
<br>
<br>Almost a year after its relaunch, Stachwiuk 
<br>estimates Radio Racja, with a staff of just 32, 
<br>has an audience of up to 400,000 mostly in 
<br>western Belarus, plus tens of thousands of 
<br>exiles, and says it is building up rapidly on 
<br>short and medium wave and on a newly launched FM band:
<br>
<br>"The station can be heard well on medium wave all 
<br>the way to (Belarus capital) Minsk and can even be picked up in Finland."
<br>
<br>The station has a small network of reporters, 
<br>mostly working under pseudonyms, across Belarus 
<br>who record programmes using MP3 technology and 
<br>send them via the Internet to Bialystok or to one 
<br>of two covert editing stations in Belarus.
<br>
<br>Radio Racja editors say their correspondents face 
<br>daily harassment from the Belarus authorities -- 
<br>mostly just petty intimidation but occasionally arrest and jail.
<br>
<br>"Several of our people have been put in prison 
<br>for a few days, one for 10 days, but nothing more 
<br>serious so far," said Michal Andrysiuk, 47, head of FM broadcasting.
<br>
<br>"One of our correspondents broadcast live from a 
<br>police car after being arrested on a charge of 
<br>cursing in the street. Hooliganism is the most 
<br>frequent official excuse to arrest people who are 
<br>obviously known to the police," he said.
<br>
<br>"NO TRUTH IN THE NEWS"
<br>
<br>Belarus opposition politicians and journalists 
<br>welcome Radio Racja's efforts to break the state 
<br>media monopoly but say its impact so far has been 
<br>limited, partly because most Belarussians rely on television for news.
<br>
<br>Zhanna Litvina, head of the Belarussian 
<br>Association of Journalists, said by telephone it 
<br>was a "comforting thought that such radio 
<br>stations exist and that Belarussians are working for them".
<br>
<br>"Unfortunately, you cannot say that such projects 
<br>are very effective in current Belarussian 
<br>conditions. To make them effective you would need 
<br>transmitters in Belarus and under current conditions that is impossible."
<br>
<br>But the radio station's backers in Poland are 
<br>convinced that there is an audience and that it is growing:
<br>
<br>"I was in Belarus some time ago and met people 
<br>listening to the radio and glad of it," said 
<br>Michal Dworczyk, a key advisor on eastern 
<br>European issues to Polish Prime Minister Jaroslaw 
<br>Kaczynski. "The media role in the fight for 
<br>democracy is indisputable. For Belarus and its people, it is essential."
<br>
<br>And Radio Racja's staff say they are not 
<br>discouraged and will keep broadcasting, even if the audience is tiny.
<br>
<br>"We really want to show what is going on. We try 
<br>to be objective, asking for comment from the 
<br>government, but they won't talk to us," said 
<br>programme director Jana Kamienskaja, 37.
<br>
<br>"'There is no news in the truth, and there is no 
<br>truth in the news' -- unfortunately this old 
<br>Soviet proverb is still valid in Belarus."
<br>
<br>Belarus officials declined to comment on Radio Racja.
