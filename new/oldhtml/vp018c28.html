"The purpose of this meeting was to open a dialogue and provide a source or channel of information." <br><br>The television leaders said the meeting was a preliminary contact with an eye to developing a relationship with the White House, which so far has been minimal. <br><br>"A dialogue had to begin," said Lionel Chetwynd, a conservative producer who has been working to promote contact between the Bush White House and the largely liberal entertainment industry. "There was a feeling around the table that something is wrong if half the world thinks we're the Great Satan and we want to make that one right. There's a genuine feeling that we as Americans are failing to get our message across to the world." <br><br>Moonves said that "the whole idea was a throwback - Frank Capra was mentioned often in the meeting - the idea that Hollywood has historically helped spread the message." Capra directed many inspirational films during World War II, a time when the government played an active role in encouraging patriotic movies. "It really was a fact-finding session. They were listening more, as opposed to asking for X, Y or Z," he said. <br><br>Neither side offered many specific ideas during the two-hour meeting, according to participants. Some said it was not clear if the White House was actively seeking Hollywood's help or merely offering assistance to entertainment industry initiatives. <br><br>The lack of clarity left some at the meeting, among the industry's most powerful figures, frustrated. <br><br>"It's incumbent on them to get specific and concrete," said Sandy Grushow, Fox Entertainment Group chairman, who attended the session. "At this point, it's amorphous. It's pretty obvious that they came to Hollywood with more questions than answers." <br><br>But Buchan, the White House spokeswoman, said the idea was for the entertainment industry to propose collaboration. "The industry will make their own determination as to what they wish to do," she said. "The entertainment industry is responding to the crisis, they plan to continue, and they want to do so in way that's responsible." <br><br>The meeting was set up by Chetwynd and attorney-to-the-stars Bruce Ramer, both friends of the Bush administration. The Clinton White House had a close relationship with movie and television moguls and stars. Moonves, for example, was a friend of Clinton. <br><br>Among the possible collaborations between Hollywood and the White House discussed at the meeting were public service announcements and documentaries or other programs produced by the studios that could be broadcast over the Voice of America. <br><br>President Bush's counselor, Karen P. Hughes, recently asked Fox to use its prime-time show "America's Most Wanted" to focus on terrorists suspected of involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks, which the network did. <br><br>Says Grushow, "We were flattered and proud to be able to assist them." <br><br>The White House has also explored putting together a benefit concert to aid victims of the attacks. That proposal is separate from the benefit concert tomorrow at RFK Stadium. <br><br>Some at the meeting expressed concern over who would finance any future projects. "Everyone has a bottom line to think about. Who's going to pay for it?" said one network president, who asked not to be named. <br><br>Among those attending the meeting were actress-producer Sally Field, actor Ron Silver, Bryce Zabel, who heads the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences and representatives from Sony and Universal. <br><br>An administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that there would be a meeting at the White House on Monday to discuss the next move but added that the topic of marshaling Hollywood's resources was not a high priority. <br><br>Said one network head: "I don't think they've thought about their point of view on Hollywood. Several of us said, 'You need to tell us what you're looking for.' There are a lot of skills in the room, and we need some direction." He added, "I'll go a second time, but I hope there'll be more substance." <br><br>Staff writer Dana Milbank contributed to this report. <br><br><br>Â© 2001 The Washington Post Company<br><br>
