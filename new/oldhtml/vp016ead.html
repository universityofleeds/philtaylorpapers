News from U.S. Rep. Adam Smith (D-WA)<br>Chairman, House Armed Services Subcommittee on Terrorism, Unconventional<br>Threats and Capabilities; Member of House International Relations<br>Committee; vice-chair of the New Democrat Coalition.<br><br>For Immediate Release<br><br>May 22, 2008<br><br>Contact: Derrick Crowe (202) 225-6902 cell; <A HREF="mailto:derrick.crowe@mail.house.gov">derrick.crowe@mail.house.gov</A><br>mailto:<A HREF="mailto:derrick.crowe@mail.house.gov">derrick.crowe@mail.house.gov</A><br><br>Smith Amendment on Strategic Communications, Public Diplomacy Included in Defense Authorization Bill<br><br>Washington, D.C. - U.S. Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.) today won approval for<br>his amendment to the fiscal year 2009 National Defense Authorization Act<br>to enhance U.S. efforts to combat the spread of violent terrorist<br>ideology.  The Smith Amendment would address major gaps in our<br>counter-terrorism strategy by requiring the President to develop a<br>comprehensive interagency strategy for strategic communication and<br>public diplomacy.  The House of Representatives approved the amendment<br>during consideration of H.R. 5658, which passed by a vote of 384 to 23.<br><br>"Strategic communication and public diplomacy were central to our fight<br>against communism in the Cold War, and they should remain<br>front-and-center as we work to roll back al-Qaeda's and other violent<br>extremists' influence among disaffected populations.  Various<br>organizations within our government work in some way to counter<br>terrorist messages, but we lack a coordinated, comprehensive, adequately<br>resourced plan to confront al-Qaeda's ideology through a strategic<br>message campaign," Smith said.<br><br>The Smith Amendment:<br><br>*    Requires the President to develop a comprehensive interagency<br>strategy for strategic communication and public diplomacy by the end of<br>2009;<br>*    Increases Congressional oversight by requiring the<br>Administration to report to Congress on the State and Defense<br>Departments' respective roles in strategic communication and public<br>diplomacy; and<br>*    Requires the Administration to assess and report back to<br>Congress on the Defense Science Board's recommendation that the U.S.<br>establish an independent, non-profit organization to support the U.S.<br>government's strategic communication efforts.<br><br>Our nation's multifaceted fight against al-Qaida and their allies<br>includes efforts to counter their ideology - a war of ideas.  Terrorist<br>groups aggressively push their narrative through new and traditional<br>media with the aim of radicalizing and recruiting from new populations.<br>Through clever use of the Internet and a steady trickle of video<br>messages distributed to and through the media, al-Qaeda drives its<br>central messages and takes us on in the marketplace of ideas.  Numerous<br>commissions and experts recommend improving the United States'<br>engagement with foreign audiences beyond traditional<br>government-to-government relations.  Unfortunately, U.S. efforts remain<br>insufficient to counter violent extremist narratives around the world.<br>Smith's Subcommittee on Terrorism, Unconventional Threat, and<br>Capabilities repeatedly receives testimony that:<br><br>*    The U.S. doesn't have a coherent, high-level interagency<br>strategy on these issues;<br>*    The State Department and Defense Department aren't coordinating<br>sufficiently; and<br>*    We lack focus and nuance in our strategic communication<br>messaging.<br><br><br>To address these gaps in our counter-terrorism strategy, Smith offered<br>his good-government amendment through bipartisan cooperation and with<br>support of the Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committee Chairmen.<br>The Senate and the President must approve H.R. 5658 before the Smith<br>Amendment becomes law.<br><br><br># # #<br><br><br><A HREF="http://www.house.gov/adamsmith"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=http://www.house.gov/adamsmith></A><br><br><br>
