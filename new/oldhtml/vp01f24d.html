Perhaps. Bush has done well in the past by defining his own reality and setting his own agenda, rather than letting others do so.<br><br>Or, as he put it in a revealing ad-lib yesterday while talking about Social Security: "See, in my line of work you got to keep repeating things over and over and over again for the truth to sink in, to kind of catapult the propaganda."<br><br><br>
