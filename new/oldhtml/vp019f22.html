Paul Bremer<br>Administrator<br>Coalition Provisional Authority <br>Address to the Iraqi People <br>to be Broadcast on Iraqi Media Network <br>beginning 24 October 2003<br><br>I am Paul Bremer, Administrator of the Coalition Provisional Authority.<br><br>As we approach Ramadan, the month of forgiveness and mercy, I encourage those of you old enough to do so to recall Ramadan before Saddam. Recall the special character of what was a peaceful month during which family ties were reaffirmed. Then look forward to the Ramadan not far in the future when a free and sovereign Iraq enjoys internal tranquility and peace with all its neighbors.<br><br>This Ramadan you are free, many things have improved in recent months, but we all know that not everything is as it should be.<br><br>Yet, you must not lose hope. Especially during Ramadan you must not lose hope.<br><br>You must not lose hope because you have seen the evil one go.<br><br>You, the Iraqi people, whom the evil one was bound to protect, he instead tortured, he instead murdered. <br><br>You, the Iraqi people, whom the evil one was bound to feed, he instead starved. <br><br>You, the Iraqi people whom the evil one was bound to lead in peace, he instead led into foolish wars, wars which poured your blood into the sand. <br><br>When the people of the world asked the evil one to stop he sneered. <br><br>When the people of the world demanded that the evil one stop, he threatened them and fought them.<br><br>And when the evil one fought them, he fought them in your name, with your money and your blood and the blood of your fathers, your mothers and your children. <br><br>But when the enemies the tyrant drew close, he took your money and he fled your justice like a common thief and coward.<br><br>The end of tyranny gives you a future of hope.<br><br>Today the evil one evades those who pursue - but not because he believes he can return. He evades, he hides he runs because he fears your justice, justice in a court you are devising for him and his fellow evil-doers. And he will face that justice. He will pay for his crimes against Iraq and you, the Iraqi people.<br><br>Saddam's tyranny is dead. Never again will he rule the cradle of civilization. Never again will he trample the rule of law in the Hammurabi's birthplace.<br><br>And the wealth of the land gives you a future of hope.<br><br>Your land, this wonderful land between two rivers, abounds in riches. A land naturally wealthy from civilization's earliest days now returns from poverty with new investment in water for your fields and schools for your children and hospitals for your sick.<br><br>And pride in your past gives you a future of hope.<br><br>Iraq, the land between two rivers is the cradle of civilization, home to: <br><br>· Abraham, the father of all the people of the book,<br><br>· the Code of Hammurabi, the first known law,<br><br>· the Caliphate, which absorbed and expanded the knowledge of the known world.<br><br>And the support of the world community gives you a future of hope.<br><br>The world shares this hope for Iraq's future - shares your confidence that you can return Iraq to the greatness it has known. <br><br>This week the United Nations, through a resolution of the Security Council, joined the Governing Council and the Coalition in calling for "efforts to restore and establish national and local institutions for representative government." <br><br>The Security Council also resolved that Iraq should have a new constitution and called for "preparation for the conference through national dialogue and consensus-building as soon as practicable&"<br><br>You have great tasks before you as you and other Iraqis devise a form of government which will:<br><br>· prevent the rise of a new tyrant,<br><br>· end advantage arising from religion or ethnicity, and<br><br>· achieve equality of opportunity for all men and women.<br><br>Now, as never before in your lifetimes, your future is full of hope. In this blessed time, we share a common vision that: <br><br>· You will live in dignity.<br><br>· You will live in peace.<br><br>· You will live in prosperity.<br><br>· You will live in the quiet enjoyment of family, of friends, and of a decent income honestly earned.<br><br>· You will live in an Iraq governed by and for Iraqis.<br><br>These things will come to pass. <br><br>These things will come to pass because you, the people of Iraq, will make them come to pass. By calling on your great past, you, the Iraqi people, will build a great future, a future of hope<br><br><br>
