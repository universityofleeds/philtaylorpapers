"This was followed by what Condoleeza Rice did and what Alastair Campbell did and culminated in the bombing of our office in Kabul, whether this was deliberate or not."<br><br>Speaking of al-Jazeera's new-found reputation in the west after September 11, Mr Fouda said it had acquired its status "for all the wrong reasons".<br><br>"We have never been judged on the quality of the work we do," he said.<br><br>Al-Jazeera shot to prominence in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks because it was chosen by Osama bin Laden as the conduit for his videotaped statements to Muslims across the world.<br><br>It has gained a reputation for avoiding the worst excesses of state censorship imposed on many Arab TV networks, and has a huge reach in countries in the Islamic world.<br><br>It is estimated 78% of homes in the West Bank have access to al-Jazeera. <br><br><br><br>
