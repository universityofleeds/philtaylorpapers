CATHARINES, CANADA -- (OfficialWire) -- 04/13/04 -- The U.S. military has begun an investigation into a gag photo of Lance Cpl. Ted J. Boudreaux Jr, a reservist with Headquarters and Service Company, 3rd Battalion, 23rd Marines that has him posing with two Iraqi children.<br><br>Unfortunately, Lcpl Boudreaux took this opportunity to humiliate two unsuspecting children and further sour relations with the Arab community by having one of the boys hold up a sign that reads, "Lcpl Boudreaux killed my Dad, th[en] he knocked up my sister!"<br><br>Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations issued a press release harshly condemning the actions of Lcpl Boudreaux. The largest Islamic association in America is calling on the defense department to quickly determine the legitimacy of the photo.<br><br>"If the United States Army is seeking to win the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people, this is the wrong way to accomplish that goal," council executive director Nihad Awad understated in the press release.<br><br>Capt. Jeff Pool, a Marine Forces Reserve spokesman told MarinCorpsTime that officers began an investigation when the photo originally appeared on the Internet. The Marine Corps is currently trying to determine what charges, if any, should be brought against the Lcpl Boudreaux.<br><br>Gunnery Sgt. Jamal Baadani, the president and founder of the Association of Patriotic Arab Americans in Military called the photo deplorable. "This picture and sign directed towards a Muslim family is inexcusable," he wrote to MarineCorpsTime. <br><br>"Inexcusable because if this lance corporal was given a basic class on Islam, he would have known that remarks such as 'knocking up' a Muslim Arab woman is not tolerated and violates the honor of a Muslim woman and her family."<br><br><br>
