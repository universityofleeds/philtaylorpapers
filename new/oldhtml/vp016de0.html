Although its primary programming includes Defense Department briefings and interviews with top defense officials, the channel also carries stories about the daily life and work of service members. <br>    With all programs anchored by military personnel, the most popular show so far is a daily 30-minute newscast, said Miss Barber, although she added that another program called "Why I Serve" is an immense hit with the troops. <br>    " 'Why I Serve' has brought viewers inside the Walter Reed Army Medical Center for interviews of soldiers who've lost limbs," she said. "It just stops you in your tracks." <br>    Miss Barber said the Pentagon Channel makes every effort to avoid propaganda charges by, among other practices, offering live coverage of such events as press conferences from beginning to end, while commercial networks will pick up only the sections they deem newsworthy. <br>    "It would be propaganda if we tried to spin it," she said. <br>    The Pentagon Channel is headquartered in Alexandria with the AFRTS, which broadcasts to 177 countries, more than any other network, said AFRTS Director Melvin W. Russell. <br>    Mr. Russell and Miss Barber said the Pentagon Channel was a result of Mr. Rumsfeld's progressive plan to broaden and improve the Defense Department's public-affairs arms, both internally and externally. <br>    Although civilians can pick up the Pentagon Channel with a satellite dish, the channel's target audience is the members of the U.S. armed forces, both active and reserve. <br>    "We want to get the message out to them," said Miss Barber, adding that news about the Defense Department is "so important because we're asking from the men and women of our military more than any company asks from their employees." <br>    "It's our responsibility to equip them with everything they need to be successful in their job," she said. "Communication is the key element of that." <br>    For citizens and military personnel interested in what Americans nationwide are doing to support the U.S. armed forces, Miss Barber urged them to learn more about a new Pentagon program called the "America Supports You" campaign. <br>    She pointed people to the Web site, <A HREF="http://www.americasupportsyou.com/"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=www.americasupportsyou.com></A>, for information about the program, which highlights citizens, businesses and groups undertaking projects to support the troops, especially those deployed in the war on terrorism. <br>    <br><br><br><br>Copyright Â© 2005 News World Communications, Inc.
