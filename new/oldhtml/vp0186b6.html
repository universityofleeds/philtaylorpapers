> From: <A HREF="mailto:matt@mountainrunner.us">matt@mountainrunner.us</A><br>> To: <A HREF="mailto:johnhbrown30@hotmail.com">johnhbrown30@hotmail.com</A><br>> Subject: Smith-Mundt<br>> Date: Thu, 29 May 2008 06:43:30 -0700<br>> <br>> <br>> <br>> Plan stresses 'listening as much as transmitting<br>> DRAFT DOD STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION CONCEPT EYES SMITH-MUNDT ACT<br>> <br>> Inside the Pentagon, May 29, 2008<br>> <br>> <br>> The U.S. military's draft concept for how commanders should carry out<br>> strategic communication within a broader national effort circa 2016 to<br>> 2028 proposes revising American antipropaganda laws.<br>> <br>> The draft document asserts American statutes barring the release of<br>> information from "certain military resources" to U.S. audiences may<br>> need to be updated.<br>> <br>> The 1948 Smith-Mundt Act, prohibiting domestic distribution of<br>> information intended for foreign audiences, is based on "an outdated<br>> model of global communication," U.S. Joint Forces Command argues.<br>> <br>> "The principle of not misleading domestic audiences remains valid --<br>> in fact, misleading any audience is unusually counterproductive in the<br>> long run -- but this could be achieved by other ways than arbitrarily<br>> prohibiting any domestic use of some capabilities," the concept<br>> states.<br>> <br>> The draft document also reinforces "listening as much as<br>> transmitting," which is in sync with recent guidance from Chairman of<br>> the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Michael Mullen.<br>> <br>> Inside the Pentagon reviewed the April 25 draft of the strategic<br>> communication joint integrating concept, or JIC. JFCOM expects the<br>> Joint Requirements Oversight Council to approve the concept in<br>> September.<br>> <br>> JFCOM's J-9 concepts groups, U.S. Special Operations Command and U.S.<br>> Strategic Command are working together in this effort, which was<br>> spearheaded by the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review execution roadmap<br>> for strategic communication.<br>> <br>> Also involved are the combatant commands, the services, the Joint<br>> Staff, the Office of the Secretary of Defense and other Pentagon<br>> agencies.<br>> <br>> Dated April 25, the briefing argues there will be "no separate<br>> strategic communication process in the future, but that strategic<br>> communication will be inherent in the planning and conduct of all<br>> operations."<br>> <br>> The notion is in line with a Dec. 14, 2007, memo, in which Mullen<br>> advocated making the transition to embedded strategic communication<br>> thinking and planning across the Defense Department. The United States<br>> must focus less on promoting its own story globally and more on<br>> listening to Muslims worldwide and understanding the subtleties of<br>> that community, writes Mullen (ITP, Jan. 10, p1).<br>> <br>> The JIC spends a great deal of time discussing the idea of influence,<br>> which it defines as "convincing others to think and act in ways<br>> compatible with our objectives, whether this means causing others to<br>> adopt a specific course of action or simply understand us better and<br>> accept us more."<br>> <br>> Influence may cover a range of activities such as simple informing,<br>> educating, persuading, urging, inducing and coercing, according to the<br>> brief.<br>> <br>> The term sometimes carries negative connotations -- particularly when<br>> a friend or ally is the object of the influence -- because the term is<br>> often associated with deceptive manipulation or exploitation usually<br>> exercised against that person's best interests, it explains. But, the<br>> authors argue, the word influence under the draft concept lacks this<br>> connotation.<br>> <br>> "Influence is a pervasive and fundamental form of any social<br>> interaction, as essential to cooperation as it is to competition or<br>> conflict," states the JFCOM brief.<br>> <br>> In the future, the challenge of influence will be critical because<br>> "success in the globally interconnected information environment will<br>> frequently be less a matter of imposing one's will and more a matter<br>> of ideas and example," the brief states. "Joint forces today are not<br>> as effective as they will need to be at meeting this challenge<br>> successfully."<br>> <br>> A joint forces commander operating in the 2016 to 2028 time frame will<br>> employ a range of informational and other capabilities to identify,<br>> segment, study and listen to potential audiences, the authors write.<br>> <br>> The commander must conceive, produce and coordinate signals through<br>> both information and actions designed to affect the perceptions,<br>> attitudes, beliefs and behaviors of selected audiences in ways<br>> supporting the mission and promoting broader national interests, the<br>> concept states. He or she must also monitor, measure and assess the<br>> effects of these signals.<br>> <br>> Finally, the commander will have to modify action and information<br>> based on feedback on the effects of the signals.<br>> <br>> Although strategic communication will not appear dramatically<br>> different than it is today, the "psychological impact will be central<br>> in all operational planning and execution to the degree that strategic<br>> communication will no longer even be recognized as a distinct<br>> discipline," states the document.<br>> <br>> Moreover, it says, intelligence will change significantly to support<br>> the needs of strategic communication, stressing the collection and<br>> analysis of information on the perceptions, attitudes and beliefs of<br>> potential audiences. These do not qualify as traditional intelligence<br>> targets, it adds.<br>> <br>> The draft concept suggests more "deliberative and proactive" strategic<br>> communication in the future will allow commanders to better anticipate<br>> developments and have "on-call" communication plans in place.<br>> <br>> A heavy focus on assessment will also figure into this new brand of<br>> strategic communication, according to the concept.<br>> <br>> Once the concept is adopted, communications will be "more<br>> discriminate, more cohesive, more adaptive, faster and more<br>> decentralized," the authors say.<br>> <br>> Implementing the plan will require several key capabilities.<br>> <br>> Commanders need to be able to access, produce and maintain<br>> intelligence and other knowledge on the perceptions, attitudes and<br>> beliefs of potential audiences.<br>> <br>> Commanders must be able to access, produce and maintain intelligence<br>> on complex social communication systems, including the characteristics<br>> of media channels and the intentions, capabilities and efforts of<br>> other "influencers" within and having an effect on the joint<br>> operations area.<br>> <br>> To bring the concept into effect, commanders should detect, monitor,<br>> translate and assess the effects of the strategic communication<br>> efforts on friendly governments, non-state groups, neutrals,<br>> competitors and adversaries, the concept says.<br>> <br>> Moreover, these future leaders must be able to estimate the direct and<br>> indirect effects of potential signals on the perceptions, attitudes,<br>> beliefs and actions of selected audiences, the authors write.<br>> <br>> Other important skills will include conceiving and formulating<br>> "timely, resonant . . . and culturally attuned messages" to sway<br>> selected audiences; producing and delivering information to influence<br>> selected audiences; conceiving and coordinating physical actions or<br>> maintaining physical capabilities to influence selected audiences;<br>> extensively documenting joint force actions; and monitoring, measuring<br>> and assessing the impact of "friendly signals" on audiences in<br>> relation to expected effects.<br>> <br>> Finally, it will be necessary for these commanders to integrate all<br>> joint force actions to maximize desired effects on selected audiences,<br>> and coordinate joint forces actions with the influence efforts of<br>> other agencies and partners within the context of a broader national<br>> strategy, the draft states.<br>> <br>> There are, however, risks and implications linked to adopting this<br>> concept, as spelled out in the document.<br>> <br>> For example, it argues, the concept establishes deep understanding of<br>> potential audiences and social communication networks as the necessary<br>> basis for effective communication.<br>> <br>> "This type and level of understanding may prove unattainable,"<br>> according to the JFCOM document. "This said, there is no minimum level<br>> of understanding required to execute this concept. However, the<br>> quality of any communication effort will vary directly with the level<br>> of understanding."<br>> <br>> The key to lessen this risk is to improve the process of building<br>> situational awareness -- primarily through doctrine, training and<br>> education -- with respect to audience perceptions, attitudes and<br>> beliefs, it states.<br>> <br>> The greatest implications to instituting the concept will fall in the<br>> areas of doctrine, leader development and intelligence, according to<br>> the draft concept.<br>> <br>> Wrapping up their discussion of a new brand of strategic<br>> communication, the authors offer an imaginary scenario where the<br>> policy is applied to the southwest Pacific region of Mesonesia.<br>> <br>> An economically vibrant and politically dynamic "Pacific Tiger," the<br>> region is religiously and ethnically diverse in 2016.<br>> <br>> Although the United States and Mesonesia have never been close, the<br>> U.S. administration decides the "conditions are right for détente" and<br>> embarks on a plan from 2016 to 2020 to increase understanding and<br>> improve relations between the two countries, as outlined in the<br>> document.<br>> <br>> The authors explain this means "improving the U.S. brand image" in<br>> Mesonesia, as well as throughout the entire region, and preventing the<br>> global Islamist insurgency from gaining influence in Mesonesia.<br>> <br>> Strategic communication will play a significant role in this strategy, they<br>> say.<br>> <br>> The U.S. Information Agency -- reestablished in this imaginary<br>> scenario -- will coordinate the national effort, while U.S. Pacific<br>> Command will play a supporting role, the document states.<br>> <br>> "Because opinion polling indicates strong distrust of the U.S.<br>> military among most Mesonesians, the joint application of strategic<br>> communication purposely remains in the background and is rarely<br>> distinguishable from the broader effort," the document says.<br>> <br>> In addition, all strategic communication activities of PACOM will be<br>> conducted under the guidance of the Mesonesia Interagency Working<br>> Group, which includes U.S. government agency membership.<br>> <br>> The United States also provides security training, foreign assistance,<br>> engineering support, participation in international exercises,<br>> expanded exchange programs and regional security conferences.<br>> <br>> In his regular guidance to commanders, the fictional PACOM commander<br>> argues the United States is sometimes too focused on getting its<br>> message out.<br>> <br>> "We've got to listen more and transmit less," the fictional commander<br>> writes, echoing Mullen. "More dialogue, less lecturing." -- Fawzia<br>> Sheikh<br>> <br><br><br>
