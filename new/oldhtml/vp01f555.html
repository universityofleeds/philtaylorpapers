He graduated with a first class honours degree in History from the University of Leeds in 1975 and secured his doctorate, also from Leeds, three years later in 1978. His PhD was an examination of the very first Whitehall press department - the Foreign Office News Department - between 1914 and 1939.  The thesis was supervised by David N Dilks, and externally examined by the late W N Medlicott.<br><br>In 1978 he joined the School of History at the University of Leeds as a Lecturer in International History and Politics.  In 1982-83, he was Visiting Professor of Political Science & History at Vanderbilt University (Nashville) in the USA.  He was made a Senior Lecturer in International History in 1988 and a Reader in International Communications in 1992.  He secured his Chair in International Communications - the first of its kind in the UK - in 1998.<br><br>In between, in 1990, he was seconded to the newly created (in 1988-9) Institute of Communications Studies where he served as its first Deputy Director until 1998, when he became its second Director (succeeding Professor Nicholas Pronay).  He was Director for four years until 2002.  <br><br>His research interests are government-media relations, public and cultural diplomacy, propaganda, psychological operations/warfare, information operations/warfare, military-media relations, international film, radio and television (international communications) - all in an historical or contemporaneous context.  <br><br>He is Associate Editor of the 'The Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television' and an adviser to 'The Journal of Information Warfare' and he serves on the international editorial board for the new journals, 'Global Media and Communication', 'Media, War and Conflict' and the USC 'Public Diplomacy Annual'.  <br><br>He also served for many years as Executive Secretary or Chairman of the InterUniversity History Film Consortium.  He was made a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society in 1982 and a member of the Public Diplomacy Council in Washington DC in 2008.<br><br>He has lectured all over the world, including at such institutions as far afield as the European Commission in Brussels and the Prime Minister's Office in Malaysia.  <br><br>In the UK, he has lectured regularly since 1992 on military education courses, especially on the MPOC* at the Defence Intelligence and Security School (DISS) at Chicksands (and previously at Ashford) and the NIOC** now at Cranfield University.  He has also lectured at the Royal College of Defence Studies and the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London, as well as at Sandhurst and at the Joint Services Command Staff College (JSCSC) at Shrivenham.  He has also been invited to speak at such bases as Catterick, RAF Fylingdales, HMS Collingwood and the UK Permanent Joint Force Headquarters at Northwood.<br><br>On military matters outside the UK, he has been invited to speak several times at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in Mons, Belgium, and on NATO Bi-Strategic courses first held at the Polish Land Forces HQ in Warsaw, and subsequently in Paris, Bratislava, Tallinn and Berlin.  In Germany, he has lectured at Church House, at the NATO School at Oberammergau, to the 1st Armoured Division at Herford, twice to the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) at Rheindahlen, and at the HQ of the Allied Land Component Command in Heidelberg.  He has also spoken at the Norwegian Defence and Security School (NORDISS) and at the Norwegian Staff Defence College in Oslo, the Swedish Defence College in Stockholm, the Royal Danish Defence College in Copenhagen, the Finnish National Defence College in Helsinki, CIMIC**** North in Holland, and the Italian Air Force Academy in Naples.  Further afield, he has addressed the armed forces in Singapore, the Mubarak Al-Abdullah College for Joint Command and Staff in Kuwait City, and Jayne's Gulf Defence Conference (IDEX) in Abu Dhabi.<br><br>In North America, he has lectured to the Canadian Armed Forces at Montreal Garrison and at the Canadian Department of National Defence in Ottawa, and he has also spoken at the US Army War College in Pennsylvania and at US Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa. He has also spoken for the past 18 years at NATO sponsored courses (the JSPOC***) at the United States Air Force Special Operations Command at Hurlburt Field Air Force Base, Florida. The JSPOC has now relocated to Tampa.<br><br>In 2002, he was consulted by the Prosecution Team of the Milosevic trial at the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague on Serbian propaganda. In 2010, he was invited to submit written evidence to the House of Commons' Foreign Affairs Committee on influence activities in the AfPak region (see <A HREF="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmfaff/writev/afpak/afpak11.htm"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmfaff/writev/afpak/afpak11.htm></A>)<br> <br>As well as almost 100 journal articles and book chapters, he has published 14 books, including 'Munitions of the Mind: a history of propaganda from the ancient world to the present day' (3rd edition 2003); 'Global Communications, International Affairs and the Media since 1945' (1997), 'British Propaganda in the 20th Century: Selling Democracy' (1999), 'Shooting the Messenger: the political impact of war reporting' (2008, with Paul Moorcraft) and the 'Routledge Handbook of Public Diplomacy' (2008, co-edited with Nancy Snow).  His latest publication is as contributing author to 'Pockets of Resistance: British news media, war and theory in the 2003 invasion of Iraq' (Piers Robinson, Peter Goddard, Kate Parry, Craig Murray, 2010). His work has been translated into Arabic, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Italian and Spanish.<br><br>He has made many media appearances, including on BBC's 'Newsnight' and 'Timewatch' programmes, Channel 4 News, Sky News, BBC Radio 4 and 5 Live, and he has written op-ed pieces, inter alia, for 'The Washington Post' and 'Al Ahram' (Egypt).  He was a panel judge for the History Today best historical documentary of 2010 for the Grierson Awards.<br><br>In the summer of 2006 he was made Distinguished Visiting Professor in Communications and Media Studies at the Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) in Shah Alam (Malaysia).  He has since been made an Adjunct Professor of the Centre for Media and Information Warfare Studies at UiTM and a Fellow of the Centre for Public Diplomacy in the University of Southern California.  In 2008, he was made a Visiting Professor at the Defence Academy of the United Kingdom at Cranfield University as part of his duties on the Postgraduate Certificate in Information Operations now being taught there.
