Rumsfeld called that a ``dangerous deficiency.''<br><br>Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy of the opposition Democratic Party immediately criticized Rumsfeld as missing the point.<br><br>``Clearly, we need to improve our public diplomacy and information age communication in the Muslim world,'' Kennedy said in a statement. ``But nothing has done more to encourage increased Al Qaeda recruitment and made America less safe than the war in Iraq and the incompetent way it's been managed. Our greatest failure is our policy.''<br><br>Rumsfeld lamented that vast media attention about U.S. abuses at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq outweighed that given to the discovery of ``Saddam Hussein's mass graves.''<br><br>On the emergence of satellite television and other media not under Arab state control, he said, ``While al Qaeda and extremist movements have utilized this forum for many years ... we in the government have barely even begun to compete in reaching their audiences.''<br><br><br>
