Prior to that, some contingency considerations had been undertaken, but these were aimed only at looking at in-place doctrine, procedures and arrangements to ensure that should planning demands pick up that media-related activities could respond.<br><br><br>  Detailed timelines for planning within DGCC and PJHQ were as follows:<br><br><br><br>October/November 2002<br><br> -   Watching brief.<br><br> -   Outline planning in support for Defence Crisis Management Centre.<br><br> -   Initial considerations of the Media Ops capability requirement - personnel and equipment.<br><br> -   Initial considerations of Green Book arrangements.<br><br>December 2002<br><br> -   Participation in US-led Ex INTERNAL LOOK, which included a media ops element.<br><br> -   Further refinement of possible in-theatre media arrangements.<br><br> -   Further refinement of capability requirements.<br><br> -   Nomination of key individuals - Spokesmen and Media Advisers.<br><br>January 2003<br><br> -   Comprehensive DGCC/PJHQ Media Ops Stocktake.<br><br> -   Agreed equipment acquisition plan and funding.<br><br> -   DGCC brief to Broadcast Editors re Green Book arrangements and the embedding arrangements.<br><br> -   Similar but separate brief to Print Editors.<br><br> -   DGCC/PJHQ briefing to Spokesmen and Media Advisers.<br><br>February 2003<br><br> -   DGCC/D News visit to US DOD with Mr Hoon<br><br> -   DGCC agree operating procedures for incidents with PJHQ.<br><br> -   Refinement of Embedded War Correspondent plan<br><br> -   Detailed manning for Media Operations confirmed<br><br>March 2003<br><br> -   DGCC Operational Procedures Rehearsal.<br><br> -   War Correspondent numbers and nominations finalised.<br><br> -   War Correspondent training and deployment to theatre.<br><br> -   Press Office re-organised for 24/7 operation.<br>MINISTERIAL INVOLVEMENT <br><br>  Ministers were briefed on planning as a whole, throughout the planning process, and were kept abreast of the main decisions and developments in the Media Operation but were not involved in specific Media Operations planning.<br><br><br>NO 10 INVOLVEMENT <br><br>  In terms of the preparation and planning of the media operation there was no specific No 10 Press Office involvement, although the usual, daily, No10 chaired inter-departmental media coordination meeting took place throughout. In addition, during the most intense phase there was a No 10 chaired weekly inter-departmental overview meeting to discuss media issues amongst the Departments concerned.<br><br><br>(Q1410)  A note on the costs of the media operation <br><br><br>  Planning for operations in Iraq envisaged the deployment of upwards of 170 Media Operations Staff to engage with the media, provide advice to Comds and act as spokespeople. This was to be achieved through the augmentation of HQ Media Ops staff and the formation of Press Information Centres. Activities to be planned for were as follows:<br><br><br><br> -   Media Operations planning.<br><br> -   Provision of advice.<br><br> -   Engaging with and escorting the Media.<br><br> -   Media briefings and conferences.<br><br> -   Co-ordination and management of media facilities.<br><br> -   Passage of media related information at rapid tempo<br><br> -   External and Internal communications.<br>  Some costs are inevitably impossible to extract from overall expenditures, particularly as costs for media related activities in theatre, where the bulk of the activity took place, were not accounted for separately. The most significant extra costs, imposed by the need to maintain effective and rapid response to the evolving situation and meet the media's appetite for information, came from the requirement to equip the Media Operations effort for operations in Quatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and, eventually, Iraq. It was also necessary to ensure that the Media Operations Group was self-sufficient and capable of enduring through a sustained campaign.<br><br><br>  As the levels of equipment capability (specialist and military) were insufficient to meet this requirement, further UOR investment was necessary as follows:<br><br><br><br>Deployable "Flyaway" kits ( IT/Comms)  257,000 <br>Office eqpt 10,000 <br>Media Production eqpt (CCT, web) 39,000 <br>AV suite of eqpt 30,000 <br>Flightcases 5,000 <br>Consumables 50,000 <br>Total 391,000 <br><br><br><br><br>(Q1426)  A list of embedded journalists and the units to which they were allocated<br><br><br>  Notes:<br><br><br><br> -   This allocation was based on Green Book guidelines, with the actual choices of names for each unit made by the representative media bodies, not MOD.<br><br> -   This list also includes broadcast technicians.<br><br><br><br>Last Name First Name Organisation  Unit <br>1.
