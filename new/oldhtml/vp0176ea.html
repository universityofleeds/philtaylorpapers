Last Updated: Thursday, 15 May, 2003, 08:50 GMT 09:50 UK  <br><br><br><A HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/correspondent/3028585.stm"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/correspondent/3028585.stm></A><br><br>Saving Private Lynch story 'flawed'<br><br>By John Kampfner  <br><br><br><br><br>Private Jessica Lynch was reportedly rescued after a tip-off <br><br>Private Jessica Lynch became an icon of the war, and the story of her capture by the Iraqis and her rescue by US special forces became one of the great patriotic moments of the conflict. <br><br>But her story is one of the most stunning pieces of news management ever conceived. <br><br>Private Lynch, a 19-year-old army clerk from Palestine, West Virginia, was captured when her company took a wrong turning just outside Nasiriya and was ambushed. <br><br>Nine of her comrades were killed and Private Lynch was taken to the local hospital, which at the time was swarming with Fedayeen. Eight days later US special forces stormed the hospital, capturing the "dramatic" events on a night vision camera. <br><br>They were said to have come under fire from inside and outside the building, but they made it to Lynch and whisked her away by helicopter. <br><br>  There was no [sign of] shooting, no bullet inside her body, no stab wound <br><br>Dr Harith a-Houssona  <br>Reports claimed that she had stab and bullet wounds and that she had been slapped about on her hospital bed and interrogated. <br><br>But Iraqi doctors in Nasiriya say they provided the best treatment they could for the soldier in the midst of war. She was assigned the only specialist bed in the hospital and one of only two nurses on the floor. <br><br>"I examined her, I saw she had a broken arm, a broken thigh and a dislocated ankle," said Dr Harith a-Houssona, who looked after her. <br><br>Jessica amnesia <br><br>"There was no [sign of] shooting, no bullet inside her body, no stab wound - only road traffic accident. They want to distort the picture. I don't know why they think there is some benefit in saying she has a bullet injury." <br><br>Witnesses told us that the special forces knew that the Iraqi military had fled a day before they swooped on the hospital. <br><br>"We were surprised. Why do this? There was no military, there were no soldiers in the hospital," said Dr Anmar Uday, who worked at the hospital. <br><br>"It was like a Hollywood film. They cried 'go, go, go', with guns and blanks without bullets, blanks and the sound of explosions. They made a show for the American attack on the hospital - action movies like Sylvester Stallone or Jackie Chan." <br><br>There was one more twist. Two days before the snatch squad arrived, Harith had arranged to deliver Jessica to the Americans in an ambulance. <br><br>But as the ambulance, with Private Lynch inside, approached a checkpoint American troops opened fire, forcing it to flee back to the hospital. The Americans had almost killed their prize catch. <br><br>  Some brave souls put their lives on the line to make this happen <br><br>General Vincent Brooks  <br><br>When footage of the rescue was released, General Vincent Brooks, US spokesman in Doha, said: "Some brave souls put their lives on the line to make this happen, loyal to a creed that they know that they'll never leave a fallen comrade." <br><br>The American strategy was to ensure the right television footage by using embedded reporters and images from their own cameras, editing the film themselves. <br><br>The Pentagon had been influenced by Hollywood producers of reality TV and action movies, notably the man behind Black Hawk Down, Jerry Bruckheimer. <br><br>Bruckheimer advised the Pentagon on the primetime television series "Profiles from the Front Line", that followed US forces in Afghanistan in 2001. That approached was taken on and developed on the field of battle in Iraq. <br><br>As for Private Lynch, her status as cult hero is stronger than ever. Internet auction sites list Jessica Lynch items, from an oil painting with an opening bid of $200 to a $5 "America Loves Jessica Lynch" fridge magnet. <br><br>But doctors now say she has no recollection of the whole episode and probably never will.<br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><A HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/programmes/correspondent/transcripts/18.5.031.txt"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/programmes/correspondent/transcripts/18.5.031.txt></A><br><br>Correspondent: 	War Spin <br><br><br><br><br>Tx Date:			18th May 2003<br><br><br><br><br><br>This script was made from audio tape - any inaccuracies are due to voices being <br>unclear or inaudible<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>00.00.00<br><br>Correspondent Theme Music<br><br><br><br>00.00.12<br><br>Music<br><br><br><br>00.00.13<br>John Kampfner<br>Jessica Lynch - an all American icon of the war.  <br>Captured by the Iraqis.

I got a call that this was happening, I <br>knew it was going to happen in advance and we had a <br>situation where there was a lot of hot news, the President <br>had been briefed, as had the Secretary of Defence.<br><br><br><br>00.01.32<br>Aston<br>PAUL HUNTER<br>Canadian Broadcasting <br>Corporation<br>I first heard about Jessica Lynch when my phone rang at <br>three in the morning. <br><br><br><br>00.01.37<br>Jim Wilkinson<br>We alerted the press to get here for an announcement.  <br>They didn't know what was coming.<br><br><br><br>00.01.40<br>Paul Hunter<br>We thought they'd caught Saddam Hussein or something <br>like that.<br><br><br><br>00.01.43<br>General Vincent Brooks<br>Coalition forces have conducted a successful rescue <br>mission of a US Army prisoner of war held captive in Iraq.<br><br><br><br>00.01.50<br><br>Music<br><br><br><br>00.01.52<br>John Kampfner<br>Jessica is a nineteen year old clerk taken prisoner <br>when her maintenance team took a wrong turning <br>and was ambushed.

At this point she is safe.  <br>She's been retrieved.  I asked her who was holding her - <br>the regime was holding her. <br><br><br><br>00.02.56<br><br>Music<br><br><br><br>00.02.58<br>John Kampfner<br>The story was a gift to a grateful media.  There was <br>barely a mention of Jessica's fallen comrades whose <br>bodies had been retrieved from shallow graves <br>during the same mission.  A bad story had become a <br>good one.<br><br><br><br>00.03.10<br><br>Music<br><br><br><br>00.03.13<br>Bill Whitaker<br>There are reports in the Washington Post today that <br>Private Lynch fought valiantly, that she shot until she ran <br>out of ammunition, shot several Iraqi soldiers even though <br>she herself had been wounded.<br><br><br><br>00.03.26<br>Mitchell Catlin<br>Yes Natalie, Private Ryan will be treated in Germany after <br>being in the hands of the Iraqi regime for ten days.<br><br><br><br>00.03.32<br>John Kampfner<br>Did he say Private Ryan?<br><br><br><br>00.03.36<br>Private Lynch's brother<br>Oh Ma'am, I never, never questioned that she was never <br>alive.

She's been missed and loved. <br><br><br><br>00.03.49<br>John Kampfner<br>Now we're told she had stab and bullet wounds.  An <br>Iraqi witness had told the Americans he had seen <br>Jessica slapped in the hospital. <br><br><br><br>00.03.56<br>Aston<br>DONALD RUMSFELD<br>US Defence Secretary<br>Good afternoon.  We are certainly grateful for the brilliant <br>and courageous rescue of Sergeant, correction PFC <br>Jessica Lynch who was being held by Iraqi forces in, in <br>what they called a hospital. <br><br><br><br>00.04.15<br><br>Music<br><br><br><br>00.04.18<br>John Kampfner<br>That's the story as seen through American eyes.  <br><br><br><br>00.04.20<br><br>Music<br><br><br><br>00.04.23<br>John Kampfner<br>Two weeks ago we visited the scene of Jessica's <br>rescue.  Although Iraqi forces had occupied part of it, <br>this was a hospital like any other. <br><br><br><br>00.04.30<br>Aston<br>Dr HARITH AL-HOUSSONA<br>Iraqi doctor<br>At the beginning I received her in the casualty department <br>from the Iraqi security department, which referred from <br>the military hospital. <br><br><br><br>00.04.40<br>John Kampfner<br>This is one of the doctors who treated Jessica when <br>she was brought here, still unconscious by Iraqi <br>soldiers.  They put her in the only specialist bed they <br>had. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>00.04.50<br>Dr Harith Al-Houssona<br>Subtitles<br><br>I examine her, I see she <br>has a broken arm& <br>and broken thigh, <br>with a dislocated ankle.  <br>Then we do another examination. <br>There is no shooting, <br>no bullet inside her body& <br>no stab wound, no other thing, <br>merely RTA. <br>Only road traffic accident.<br><br><br><br>00.05.15<br>John Kampfner<br>One story, two versions of the truth.  The doctors say <br>they operated on her to reset her plaster.  The best <br>treatment they could provide in the midst of war.<br><br><br><br>00.05.25<br>Dr Harith Al-Houssona<br>Subtitles<br><br>We give her three bottles of blood&<br>two of them from medical staff& <br>because there is no blood at this time. <br><br><br><br>00.05.34<br>Aston<br>Dr ANMAR UDAY<br>Iraqi doctor<br>Subtitles<br><br>We consider Jessica as one <br>of our injured patients& <br>one of our Iraqi women <br>injured in the war. <br><br><br><br>00.05.43<br>John Kampfner<br>She was assigned one of only two nurses on the <br>floor.<br><br><br><br>00.05.49<br>Nurse<br>Voice over<br><br>She herself was asked about her treatment.  I was like a <br>mother to her and she my daughter.  We treated her well.<br><br><br><br>00.06.02<br>John Kampfner<br>The doctors told us that the day before the Special <br>Forces swooped on the hospital the Iraqi military had <br>fled.  Did the Americans know this?<br><br><br><br>00.06.13<br>John Kampfner<br>We found a man who saw an advance party land in <br>the town.  He says he was questioned by the team's <br>translator. <br><br><br><br>00.06.21<br>Aston<br>HASSAM HAMOUD<br>Voice over<br><br>He said; 'where is Saddam Hospital?'  I said, 'in that <br>direction'.  He said; 'are there any Fedayeen over there?'   <br>I said; 'no, there aren't any, there is no forces in there or <br>anything.'<br><br><br><br>00.06.37<br>John Kampfner<br>All the same America's finest warriors descended on <br>the building.<br><br><br><br>00.06.41<br>Dr Anmar Uday<br>Subtitles<br><br>We heard the noise of the helicopter, <br>the sound of the helicopter& <br>and I think the helicopter <br>landed here on the grass.<br><br><br><br>00.06.49<br>Dr Harith Al-Houssona<br>Subtitles<br><br>Like a film of Hollywood, <br>they cry, 'Go, go, go!'... <br>and shout, 'Go, go, go!', with guns <br>and blanks, without bullets. <br>Blanks and the sound of explosions, <br>and break the door. <br>We are very scared.<br><br><br><br>00.07.03<br>Dr Anmar Uday<br>Subtitles<br><br>We are surprised at this time.<br>Why do this?  <br>There is no military, no soldiers <br>in the hospital.<br><br><br><br>00.07.11<br>John Kampfner<br>But the Americans took no chances, restraining <br>doctors and a patient who was handcuffed to this bed <br>frame. <br><br><br><br>00.07.19<br>Dr Harith Al-Houssona<br>Subtitles<br><br>I don't know why they tie him.<br>Why tie him?  He cannot move.  <br>Why the American army tied him?<br><br><br><br>00.07.25<br><br>Music<br><br><br><br>00.07.27<br>John Kampfner<br>There was one more twist.  Two days before the <br>snatch squad arrived the doctor had arranged to <br>deliver Jessica to the Americans in an ambulance.<br><br><br><br>00.07.36<br>Dr Harith Al-Houssona<br>Subtitles<br><br>Every time, 'I want to go home, <br>I want to go home.'<br>We told her, I secretly between us,<br>I and she, I told her&<br>I will try to escape you to <br>the American Army& <br>but I will do this very secretly <br>because I lose my life.  <br>We put her in the ambulance <br>with the driver& <br>and walk out of the hospital.  <br>We told him go to <br>the American checkpoint.  <br>When he was near the <br>American checkpoint& <br>he was shot by the Americans. <br><br><br><br>00.08.08<br><br>Music<br><br><br><br>00.08.10<br>John Kampfner<br>So a tense encounter but no Iraqi troops.  The <br>Americans almost killing their prize catch by mistake.  <br>But the story had already passed into folklore. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>00.08.20<br>Dr Harith Al-Houssona<br>Subtitles<br><br>They make a show for the American <br>attack for the hospital.  <br>Action moves like Sylvester Stallone <br>or Jackie Chan& <br>with jumping and shouting, <br>breaking the door& <br>with the photos, with the photos..<br><br><br><br>00.08.34<br><br>Music<br><br><br><br>00.08.37<br>John Kampfner<br>We asked the Pentagon to release the full videotape <br>of the rescue rather than its five-minute edited <br>version to clear up any discrepancies.  It declined. <br><br><br><br>00.08.46<br>John Kampfner<br>Was there any resistance as the forces were going in?<br><br><br><br>00.08.51<br>Bryan Whitman<br>I think that I will leave that story to be told in great detail <br>when the time is right. <br><br><br><br>00.09.01<br>John Kampfner<br>What injuries did she sustain?<br><br><br><br>00.09.03<br>Aston<br>BRYAN WHITMAN<br>US Dep Assistant Secretary of <br>Defence<br>Well I'm not going to get into the specific injuries that she <br>received.  That's up to her and her doctors to discuss at <br>the appropriate time.<br><br><br><br>00.09.14<br>John Kampfner<br>Doctors now say she has no memory of the whole <br>episode and probably never will. <br><br><br><br>00.09.19<br>Bryan Whitman<br>I understand that there's some conflicting information out <br>there and in due time the full story will be told, I'm sure. <br><br><br><br>00.09.28<br><br>Music<br><br><br><br>00.09.30<br>John Kampfner<br>There are facts and there is a message.  George Bush <br>and Tony Blair knew how vital it was to get the <br>message right, to present the war and the case for <br>war.  This is how it worked - talk up the dangers.   <br><br><br><br>00.09.41<br>President George Bush <br>The United States of America will not permit the world's <br>most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's <br>most destructive weapons. <br><br><br><br>00.09.43<br>Aston<br>29th January<br><br><br><br>00.09.51<br>John Kampfner<br>Dismiss the doubters.  Appeal to the hearts and <br>minds.  Trust us. <br><br><br><br>00.09.55<br>Tony Blair<br>I do not seek unpopularity as a badge of honour.  But <br>sometimes it is the price of leadership. <br><br><br><br>00.09.57<br>Aston<br>15th March<br><br><br><br>00.10.05<br><br>Music<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>00.10.07<br>John Kampfner<br>Months of preparation over, the war media strategy <br>was ready.  The most important part of the plan was <br>to embed six hundred journalists with the military.  It <br>was a huge gamble.  The idea was that star <br>correspondents would live every minute with the <br>troops as they advanced across the desert.

I <br>think they're even more important in certain parts of the <br>world where language can be a barrier. <br><br><br><br>00.11.22<br>John Kampfner<br>Bryan Whitman was in charge of the Pentagon's <br>media planning.

And it meant we had some <br>very, very productive periods with a lot of great action <br>footage because he put us right at the front and the work <br>that, the work that we produced is some of the stuff that <br>some people say is the best of the war.<br><br><br><br>00.13.29<br>John Kampfner<br>The picture on the left is the war against Iraq, the real <br>war.

In 2001 the man behind 'Black Hawk <br>Down', Jerry Bruckheimer, visited the Pentagon to <br>pitch an idea with his co-producer.<br><br><br><br>00.13.56<br>Soldier 1<br>You all right?  You okay?<br><br><br><br>00.13.59<br>Soldier 2<br>Yeah, I can hear the bells ringing.<br><br><br><br>00.14.02<br>Aston<br>BERTRAM VAN MUNSTER<br>Jerry Bruckheimer's partner<br>He just did 'Black Hawk Down', so he's very interested in <br>the subject.  He's also a patriot.  Of course Jerry does all <br>the big movies and I do reality television and I've done <br>this for many many many years, long before even <br>anybody knew what reality was.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>00.14.19<br>John Kampfner<br>The pair came up with 'Profiles from the Frontline'; a <br>primetime series following US forces in Afghanistan, <br>made with the support of Donald Rumsfeld.  <br><br><br><br>00.14.28<br>John Kampfner<br>They were after human stories told through the eyes <br>of the soldiers.

Its popularity with viewers <br>suggested to the Pentagon that a similar approach <br>would go down well once the real fighting began, as <br>long as the embedded reporters played their part.<br><br><br><br>00.15.07<br>Reporter<br>A call came in from an artillery battery about six hundred <br>metres that way that they were under attack from Iraqi <br>soldiers on foot.

No.  I have seen <br>reporters who cover the White House over the years <br>sleep with women in this President's White House and <br>that President's White House.  That's incestuous, that's <br>too close.

Some didn't.  <br><br><br><br>00.17.16<br>Walt Rogers<br>It's a very symbolic little statement I was making, but it did <br>say, I'm not a soldier.  Some of my colleagues didn't do <br>that and I think they crossed a line there.<br><br><br><br>00.17.26<br>Bryan Whitman<br>I think it's difficult not to be enthusiastic about what you're <br>doing if you're out there with our soldiers.<br><br><br><br>00.17.35<br>Soldier<br>We bomb 'em.  You know it's cool to me that like <br>explosions and stuff like that but like I don't get to see the <br>actual explosion and that's what I want to see, but I guess <br>when we get closer to Baghdad we'll get to see more of <br>that stuff, so&<br><br><br><br>00.17.49<br>John Kampfner<br>Embeds and their protectors agreed a set of rules.  <br>Not giving away battle positions or unit strengths in <br>return for access.

We get out of the, <br>out of the Land Rover and we hide in a ditch.  One of the <br>marines said; why don't you make yourself useful?  And <br>he's throwing these flares at me.  And he's throwing the <br>flares at me and I'm throwing them at the guy who's got to <br>light them and send them off into the sky, and I'm <br>thinking, why, what am I doing here?<br><br><br><br>00.18.39<br>John Kampfner<br>Tension was particularly high on the eve of war.  <br>Some journalists assembling with the British forces <br>in Kuwait were ordered not to report what they saw.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>00.18.47<br>Aston<br>CRAIG COPETAS<br>Bloomberg<br>We were not allowed to take any pictures or describe <br>British soldiers carrying guns.  I was told that there was a, <br>a decision made by Downing Street that the military <br>minders of the journalists down there were to go to any <br>lengths to, to not portray British, the British fighting man <br>and women as fighters. <br><br><br><br>00.19.12<br>Craig Copetas<br>They wanted them there to have them there as nation-<br>builders, that they weren't going to be killing people.  The <br>media minders would get very very upset with you very <br>fast and threats were levelled you that you would be <br>disembedded.<br><br><br><br>00.19.30<br>Aston<br>ABC News Australia<br><br><br><br>00.19.30<br>John Kampfner<br>Sometimes embedded reporters did send dispatches <br>that put their military hosts in a bad light.

In reality they spend their <br>long days catching the news off TV like viewers back <br>home.<br><br><br><br>00.22.04<br>Aston<br>MICHAEL WOLFF<br>New York magazine<br>The only window that you had into actually what was <br>going on in the war were that, were that there were a set <br>of television monitors in front of the coffee bar, and you <br>could lean against the coffee bar and look up at the <br>monitors and, and see at least what Fox was telling you <br>was gong on in the war.<br><br><br><br>00.22.24<br>John Kampfner<br>The main event is the two p.m. press conference, <br>officially the Freedom Briefing, time for breakfast <br>shows back in the US.

I'm ready for your <br>questions?<br><br><br><br>00.22.55<br>John Kampfner<br>This is mainly an American show.  The favoured US <br>networks receive the best seats, allies next, then the <br>rest.

Next to him in civvies Simon Wren on a <br>mission from Downing Street.  Brits and Americans <br>fighting the real battle and the media battle shoulder <br>to shoulder.  At least that's the plan.<br><br><br><br>00.23.23<br>General Vincent Brooks<br>I don't have anything else that I can give you in detail on <br>that and I appreciate the question&<br><br><br><br>00.23.27<br>Aston<br>JIM WILKINSON<br>US Military Spokesman, Centcom<br>There's a daily conference call that has Torie Clarke, at <br>the office of the Secretary of Defence.  You have the <br>State Department, Number Ten, the Foreign Office, the <br>UN, the White House, Qatar and others on there, and the <br>United Kingdom is on that call, and so there's any number <br>of mechanisms, and we found that you know if you're <br>talking often you never let the press come between you, <br>which is important.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>00.23.51<br>John Kampfner<br>The machine must be fed.

Other non-attributable <br>lines during the war found their way into newspapers <br>as fact.<br><br><br><br>00.28.05<br>John Kampfner<br>Saddam Hussein is dead.

Were <br>stories like these wishful thinking?  Overeager <br>commanders?  Overeager journalists?  Or more than <br>that?  When Basra refused to fall the British told the <br>world of an uprising.  <br><br><br><br>00.29.28<br>John Kampfner<br>There's a cycle.  It starts as raw information on the <br>ground.<br><br><br><br>00.29.31<br>Aston<br>RICHARD GAISFORD<br>With the British forces, Basra <br>My reports have been coming from the Royal Scots <br>Dragoon Guards battle group headquarters and there <br>they have reported this uprising.  They reported an <br>uprising amongst public there that was being put down by <br>Iraqi troops actually in the city centre.<br><br><br><br>00.29.47<br>John Kampfner<br>This is then given credence by spokesmen at <br>Centcom.<br><br><br><br>00.29.50<br>British Spokesman<br>And of course this is just the sort of encouraging <br>indication that we have been looking for.<br><br><br><br>00.29.56<br>John Kampfner<br>By the evening news the story has hardened further.<br><br><br><br>00.30.01<br>Aston<br>BBC News<br><br><br><br>00.30.01<br>Ben Brown<br>Gunners from the Royal Horse Artillery have been firing in <br>support of a popular uprising here. <br><br><br><br>00.30.08<br>John Kampfner<br>The story dovetailed with a propaganda leaflet <br>campaign on the ground, and this appeal to the Iraqis <br>from the Prime Minister.<br><br><br><br>00.30.15<br>Aston<br>25th March<br><br><br><br>00.30.14<br>Tony Blair<br>And my message to them today is that this time we will <br>not let you down.  Saddam and his regime will be <br>removed.<br><br><br><br>00.30.23<br>John Kampfner<br>Two objectives for the price of one.  Back home <br>public opinion is rallied.  In Iraq a domino effect is <br>created.<br><br><br><br>00.30.31<br>Paul Hunter<br>So if word comes out of Centcom that there is an uprising <br>against Saddam's regime will certainly they can be <br>thinking, planning, hoping that that information will be <br>then picked up on and it will be, then the local people will <br>build on that and, and, and the idea will become reality, <br>even if it never existed in the first place.<br><br><br><br>00.30.53<br>Aston<br>RICHARD SAMBROOK <br>Head of BBC News<br>I think actually most people will have known that Um <br>Quasa didn't fall when it was first suggested it had and <br>would have known that there wasn't an uprising in Basra.  <br>So I think actually over, over a course of time the way that <br>people watch and listen and gather their information they <br>will have discovered what was true and what wasn't.<br><br><br><br>00.31.07<br>Aston<br>Group Captain AL LOCKWOOD<br>UK Military Spokesman<br>Basra uprising I believe still at this stage that something <br>happened there, but it was seen as an uprising.  We <br>briefed it that there had been civil disturbance, it could <br>have been an uprising, and were very hesitant about it.<br><br><br><br>00.31.22<br>Aston<br>ITV News<br><br><br><br>00.31.22<br>Terry Lloyd <br>We passed burnt out cars and the clothes left behind by <br>Iraqi soldiers who had either fled the battlefield or <br>surrendered.  <br><br><br><br>00.31.29<br>John Kampfner<br>With embedded journalists seeing the battle in <br>microcosm, with reliable information hard to come by <br>at Centcom, the truth was proving elusive.  There <br>were a few journalists trying to find out for <br>themselves what was really going on, but theirs was <br>a dangerous game.<br><br><br><br>00.31.44<br>Aston<br>TERRY LLOYD<br>ITV News<br>This was until a few hours ago was an Iraqi frontline <br>stronghold.  Nothing much to see just a couple of <br>portacabins where the Iraqi flag still flies.<br><br><br><br>00.31.53<br>Daniel Demoustier<br>We were a roving team.  That means a team that is not <br>embedded but works independently.  Our task was to go <br>for the human interest story, you know, try to find Iraqi <br>people, talk to them, try to find out from them what is <br>going on.<br><br><br><br>00.32.09<br>Aston<br>DANIEL DEMOUSTIER<br>ITV News cameraman<br>There was a team decision, based on the information we <br>had that we would go, try to go direction Basra.<br><br><br><br>00.32.17<br>John Kampfner<br>They were only on that road because they'd heard the <br>reports that their original destination Um Quasa had <br>fallen, reports that turned out to be false.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>00.32.26<br>Daniel Demoustier<br>Firing started from exactly that position, coming from the <br>American tanks.  The front window went straight away, <br>and that same moment, I, I don't know, I don't know how I <br>did it, but I went with my head under the steering wheel.  I <br>can't even do it now, but I went in there, it's probably why <br>I got the blue eye.<br><br><br><br>00.32.44<br>Daniel Demoustier<br>So I protected myself and I kept on driving, and I looked <br>to the right and Terry's gone.<br><br><br><br>00.32.53<br>John Kampfner<br>Terry Lloyd was one of ten journalists killed in action; <br>two of his colleagues are still missing.<br><br><br><br>00.32.58<br>Richard Sambrook<br>Editorially and objectively I would much sooner have <br>been able to operate independently to a greater extent <br>than we did but on safety grounds it simply wasn't <br>possible.<br><br><br><br>00.33.06<br>John Kampfner<br>What was the role then of the unilaterals?<br><br><br><br>00.33.09<br>Jim Wilkinson<br>Er, they were a pain in our rear a lot of times.  Many of <br>them were wounded, some killed.  They would show up <br>on the battle space despite our warnings.<br><br><br><br>00.33.19<br>John Kampfner<br>Coping with bad news stories is the toughest test of <br>all.  A street market in the Sha'ab district of Baghdad, <br>unexplained explosions kill fourteen.  People blamed <br>the Americans, not the sort of image Downing Street <br>and the Pentagon had in mind.  <br><br><br><br>00.33.33<br>John Kampfner<br>Journalists here had Iraqi minders and were outside <br>the control of Coalition media managers.<br><br><br><br>00.33.39<br>Rageh Omaar<br>What's impossible to say now is what could possibly have <br>been a military target in such a populated area?<br><br><br><br>00.33.41<br>Aston<br>BBC News<br><br><br><br>00.33.46<br>John Kampfner<br>The story emerging on the ground points to a stray <br>American missile attack on a day when sandstorms <br>could have interfered with targeting.  Many of the <br>dead were working on cars in workshops.  Survivors <br>told us how they saw a plane and two impacts on <br>either side of the road consistent with an allied <br>attack. <br><br><br><br>00.33.05<br>Aston<br>MOHAMMAD AL ZUBEDDY<br>Garage owner<br>Voiceover<br><br>When the two rockets fell near here someone who was <br>working under his car was crushed and burned.  And then <br>there were four others they died as well when their cars <br>caught fire.<br><br><br><br>00.34.17<br>Aston<br>ROBERT FISK<br>The Independent<br>Several people talked of hearing the aircraft.  I'd heard a <br>plane shortly before this and there was no doubt in my <br>mind that the piece of shrapnel, the equidistant craters, it <br>was clearly an American or British aircraft, which fired <br>missiles into what is in effect a marketplace.<br><br><br><br>00.34.32<br>John Kampfner<br>An awkward moment for Centcom.  It's on the <br>defensive.  It reacts slowly at first.<br><br><br><br>00.34.37<br>Reporter 1<br>Iraq is reporting today that there was a missile attack on a <br>residential section of Baghdad that killed fourteen <br>civilians.  Can you confirm that, and tell us what went <br>wrong?<br><br><br><br>00.34.46<br>General Vincent Brooks<br>Well first I'm not aware, I've heard this report that you're <br>saying.  It's in the media right now.  We don't have a <br>report that corroborates that and so I can't confirm it.<br><br><br><br>00.34.55<br>John Kampfner<br>Then a blanket denial.  The allies are not killing <br>civilians.<br><br><br><br>00.35.00<br>John Kampfner<br>Another look at that British list of traps shows <br>bombing accuracy and the market bombings at <br>numbers five and seven.<br><br><br><br>00.35.07<br>Reporter 2<br>Many hundred of civilians, Iraqi, have been killed by <br>coalition bombs.  Do you think it will help Iraqi people to <br>believe you and to trust you, to believe that you are <br>coming to emancipate them?<br><br><br><br>00.35.26<br>Aston<br>General VINCENT BROOKS<br>US Army<br>Well thank you for the question.  Firstly I don't accept the <br>premise of the question, which says that the civilians <br>have been killed by coalition bombs.  I just don't accept <br>that.<br><br><br><br>00.35.36<br>John Kampfner<br>Some reporters at Centcom don't buy this line.<br><br><br><br>00.35.39<br>Reporter 3<br>When will you show us pictures of what happens when <br>precision bombs don't go where they're supposed to, <br>when they fail to hit their designated targets, or if they fail <br>to go off at all.  And if you don't doesn't that expose you to <br>the charge that this is more propaganda than truth?<br><br><br><br>00.35.53<br>John Kampfner<br>Next day Brooks goes on the offensive.  He co-<br>ordinates a new message with London and <br>Washington.  It was the Iraqis who did it.<br><br><br><br>00.36.00<br>General Vincent Brooks<br>They're also using very old stocks, we've discovered and <br>those stocks are not reliable and missiles are going up <br>and coming down. So we think it's entirely possible that <br>this may have been in fact an Iraqi missile that either <br>went up and came down or given the behaviour of the <br>regime lately it may have been inside of town.<br><br><br><br>00.36.18<br>John Kampfner<br>The allies still deny causing the deaths but awkward <br>questions about this and a second market bombing <br>two days later from where US missile parts were <br>recovered are left unanswered.<br><br><br><br>00.36.33<br>John Kampfner<br>The British government casts doubt on the reliability <br>of the journalists.  It says any information that isn't <br>official should be treated with suspicion.<br><br><br><br>00.36.41<br>Aston<br>3rd April<br><br><br><br>00.36.41<br>Aston<br>GEOFF HOON MP<br>Defence Secretary<br>What is important about this is all of us should look very <br>sceptically at these kinds of reports, relying only on <br>known and agreed facts.<br><br><br><br>00.36.50<br>John Kampfner<br>End of story.  The lack of hard facts prompts some <br>journalists to leave Centcom, and one to rebel.<br><br><br><br>00.37.00<br>Aston<br>MICHAEL WOLFF<br>New York magazine<br>My final question, after which I was not allowed to ask <br>any more questions, was the question that every reporter <br>was asking, not just every day, but literally every minute, <br>which was& <br><br><br><br>00.37.11<br>Michael Wolf<br>Why should we stay?  What's the value to us for what we <br>learn at this million-dollar press centre?<br><br><br><br>00.37.19<br><br>Applause<br><br><br><br>00.37.21<br>General Vincent Brooks<br>Well sir.  I've gotten applause already.  That's wonderful.  <br>I appreciate that.  First I would say it's your choice.  We <br>want to provide information that's truthful from the <br>operational headquarters that's running this war.<br><br><br><br>00.37.33<br>Michael Wolff<br>I was approached by this guy, Wilkinson.  He was sort of <br>the uber-civilian.  Also he was wearing a uniform.  I said, <br>you know, which was odd, and I said, aren't you a civilian, <br>and he said, yes, but I'm in the reserves.  I said, but <br>you're not here in the reserves.  Right, he said, right, <br>right.  So I said, actually I said, so you're a kind of a <br>paramilitary.  So we got immediately off to the wrong the <br>wrong foot.  If we were, if we had not already been on <br>completely on the wrong foot now we were.<br><br><br><br>00.37.07<br>Jim Wilkinson<br>I'm a big boy.  As they say in Texas this ain't my first <br>rodeo.  And when reporters start signing my cheques <br>then great.  But you know what General Franks signs my <br>cheque and I make news based on his terms.<br><br><br><br>00.38.18<br>Michael Wolff<br>He said, this is war, (bleep) hole.  He said, don't (bleep) <br>around with things you don't understand.  And then finally <br>it was; no more questions for you, why don't you just go <br>home?<br><br><br><br>00.38.31<br><br>Music<br><br><br><br>00.38.32<br>John Kampfner<br>Snapshots from the frontline.  Media management at <br>Central Command.  This twin track was especially <br>important to the coalition in its search for weapons of <br>mass destruction.  Any evidence would do, especially <br>for Tony Blair, who time and again cited Saddam's <br>arsenal as the main reason for going to war.<br><br><br><br>00.38.51<br>Tony Blair<br>The history of Saddam and weapons of mass destruction <br>is not American or British propaganda.  The history and <br>the present threat are real.  <br><br><br><br>00.38.52<br>Aston<br>2nd September 2002<br><br><br><br>00.39.01<br>John Kampfner<br>Journalists at Centcom are given vague lines about <br>chemical weapons on an almost daily basis without <br>any sign of a smoking gun.<br><br><br><br>00.39.10<br>General Vincent Brooks<br>While it hasn't been found, we're reminded that because <br>we haven't found it it's still there.<br><br><br><br>00.39.15<br>Reporter 1<br>Wouldn't it have happened by now?  And since it hasn't <br>happened, wouldn't it be reasonable for some people to <br>conclude that they didn't have them or weren't willing to <br>use them.<br><br><br><br>00.39.24<br>General Vincent Brooks<br>Well some might come to that conclusion.  We don't.<br><br><br><br>00.39.27<br>Aston<br>ROBIN COOK MP<br>Former Foreign Secretary<br>Well they were desperate to find something that they <br>could hail as evidence of Saddam's intention to hit us with <br>weapons of mass destruction.  After all without that the <br>whole justification of the war started to fall apart. <br><br><br><br>00.39.37<br>ABC reporter<br>A paramilitary training facility&<br><br><br><br>00.39.39<br>Aston<br>ABC News<br><br><br><br>00.39.39<br>John Kampfner<br>Embedded journalists meanwhile are led to any and <br>every site that might contain suspicious substances.  <br>The allegation is instantly reported and beamed <br>around the world.<br><br><br><br>00.39.50<br>John Kampfner<br>What did it suggest to you that the coalition forces were <br>trying to do in getting those stories out?<br><br><br><br>00.39.57<br>Aston<br>Dr HANS BLIX<br>Chief UN Weapons Inspector<br>Well you know it could have been the journalists.  They <br>were embedded, as the term was, and they were eager to <br>write a story, I suppose, and they were close to the <br>events, so they would say well here maybe is something <br>that's appetising.  And when they looked at it more closely <br>it turned out perhaps to be zero.  <br><br><br><br>00.40.14<br>Robin Cook<br>Several weeks after the hostilities finished, after they had <br>actually arrested the key players in Saddam's military <br>apparatus they still have not provided a credible weapon <br>of mass destruction, and it becomes increasingly hard to <br>believe that they are going to be able to find such a <br>capacity.<br><br><br><br>00.40.32<br>John Kampfner<br>Does it matter any more?  Opinion polls in the US <br>show the war was a success even if weapons of mass <br>destruction aren't found.  Tony Blair is benefiting <br>from the so-called 'Baghdad bounce'.  Those <br>responsible for the media campaign are reflecting on <br>a battle well fought.<br><br><br><br>00.40.51<br>Aston<br>JIM WILKINSON<br>US Military Spokesman, Centcom<br>If some people didn't like the way we handled it I think it <br>was one part of just a plain case of too bad, and a second <br>part of probably a little envy by some that they didn't get <br>embedded because the real superstars of this war were <br>those media journalists who were embeds.<br><br><br><br>00.41.08<br>John Kampfner<br>The Brits at least tried to get on with the journalists.  <br>They might be satisfied with the overall presentation <br>of the war, but they're furious about the Doha <br>operation.<br><br><br><br>00.41.18<br>John Kampfner<br>So much so that Simon Wren, Number Ten's man in <br>Doha, has written a confidential note to Alistair <br>Campbell complaining that the American briefers <br>weren't up to the job.  <br><br><br><br>00.41.28<br>John Kampfner<br>He described the Jessica Lynch presentation as <br>embarrassing.  He complained that for the first three <br>days of the war the Americans locked themselves in <br>their offices.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>00.41.37<br>Aston<br>Group Captain AL LOCKWOOD<br>UK Military Spokesman<br>Having lost the first skirmish they pretty much lost the war <br>when it came to media support. And albeit things have <br>got better and everything came to a conclusion quite <br>rapidly.  To my feelings is that they lost their initial part of <br>the campaign and they never got on the front foot again.<br><br><br><br>00.41.56<br>Group Captain Al Lockwood<br>The media advisor here was an expert in his field.  His <br>counterpart on the US side was evasive, was not around <br>as much as he should have been when it came to talking <br>to the media, and in reality what happened was you had <br>two different styles of news media management and I feel <br>fortunate to be, have been part of the UK one.<br><br><br><br>00.42.19<br>Jim Wilkinson<br>Qatar was never designed to be the font of all news.  The <br>font of all news was designed to be the frontline with our <br>embeds.  And it worked out we couldn't be happier.<br><br><br><br>00.42.27<br><br>Music<br><br><br><br>00.42.29<br>John Kampfner<br>Such wounds will heal.  Washington and London now <br>have a plan for future wars.  As the Pentagon made <br>clear, the perception of war affects its cost and <br>duration.  Now the media have their designated <br>positions, close up in the front for action shots, or <br>tied up in the rear for the not-so-big picture.<br><br><br><br>00.42.47<br><br>Music<br><br><br><br>00.42.53<br>Aston<br>RICHARD SAMBROOK<br>Head of BBC News<br>I think embeds are undoubtedly are the future.  There's <br>no question from the military point of view that they <br>provided them with you know a kind of, a, a, a level and <br>quantity of picture which was overall advantageous to <br>them.<br><br><br><br>00.43.05<br>Aston<br>DANIEL DEMOUSTIER<br>ITV News cameraman<br>You don't get anything else in that.
