FEATURE - Poland broadcasts "truth" to Belarus<br>By Chris Johnson<br>January 15, 2007<br><br>BIALYSTOK, Poland (Reuters) - From simple back <br>offices in a provincial Polish town, a radio <br>station is broadcasting around the clock to <br>Belarus, giving the ex-Soviet republic one of its <br>few sources of independent news.<br><br>Run by opponents of Belarus President Alexander <br>Lukashenko, Radio Racja (Truth) is helping wage <br>an information war against a regime branded by <br>U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as "Europe's last dictatorship".<br><br>Supported by the Polish Foreign Ministry and <br>Budapest-based Open Society Institute founded by <br>U.S. billionaire investor George Soros, Radio <br>Racja is one of only two independent stations broadcasting freely into Belarus.<br><br>The station uses Web technology to mix popular <br>music and social commentary with uncensored news <br>in both Belarussian and Russian, aiming to <br>provide a platform for both opposition parties <br>and Belarussian bands, some of which are banned at home.<br><br>"I dream of a free and independent Belarus," says <br>editor-in- chief Wiktor Stachwiuk, a 58-year-old <br>exile. "I want to give Belarussians a taste of a <br>free society. Official media do not let them hear what is really going on."<br><br>Lukashenko, in power since 1994, keeps a tight <br>rein on the eastern European country and its 10 <br>million inhabitants, sandwiched between Poland and Russia.<br><br>He rejects all criticism of his rule and has <br>called for vigilance to keep Belarus safe from <br>Western "lies and violence". Opposition <br>politicians and journalists have disappeared and <br>all media outlets face serious restrictions.<br><br>Western countries accuse Lukashenko of systematic <br>crackdowns on the opposition and dismiss all <br>Belarus elections over the last decade as unfair. <br>They say the president blatantly rigged elections <br>last year to engineer a landslide win for himself.<br><br>"I could not simply stand by and watch what was <br>happening in my country without doing anything," <br>Stachwiuk said. He first set up Radio Racja in <br>1999 and it broadcast from the Polish capital of Warsaw until 2002.<br><br>INTIMIDATION<br><br>His Warsaw station eventually ran into financial <br>problems and it took Stachwiuk and his associates <br>three more years to raise enough money to launch <br>the station in Bialystok, closer to Belarus and <br>able to broadcast deeper into the country.<br><br>It now has a budget of $1 million a year, half of <br>which is spent on transmitters: two in Poland and two in Lithuania.<br><br>Almost a year after its relaunch, Stachwiuk <br>estimates Radio Racja, with a staff of just 32, <br>has an audience of up to 400,000 mostly in <br>western Belarus, plus tens of thousands of <br>exiles, and says it is building up rapidly on <br>short and medium wave and on a newly launched FM band:<br><br>"The station can be heard well on medium wave all <br>the way to (Belarus capital) Minsk and can even be picked up in Finland."<br><br>The station has a small network of reporters, <br>mostly working under pseudonyms, across Belarus <br>who record programmes using MP3 technology and <br>send them via the Internet to Bialystok or to one <br>of two covert editing stations in Belarus.<br><br>Radio Racja editors say their correspondents face <br>daily harassment from the Belarus authorities -- <br>mostly just petty intimidation but occasionally arrest and jail.<br><br>"Several of our people have been put in prison <br>for a few days, one for 10 days, but nothing more <br>serious so far," said Michal Andrysiuk, 47, head of FM broadcasting.<br><br>"One of our correspondents broadcast live from a <br>police car after being arrested on a charge of <br>cursing in the street. Hooliganism is the most <br>frequent official excuse to arrest people who are <br>obviously known to the police," he said.<br><br>"NO TRUTH IN THE NEWS"<br><br>Belarus opposition politicians and journalists <br>welcome Radio Racja's efforts to break the state <br>media monopoly but say its impact so far has been <br>limited, partly because most Belarussians rely on television for news.<br><br>Zhanna Litvina, head of the Belarussian <br>Association of Journalists, said by telephone it <br>was a "comforting thought that such radio <br>stations exist and that Belarussians are working for them".<br><br>"Unfortunately, you cannot say that such projects <br>are very effective in current Belarussian <br>conditions. To make them effective you would need <br>transmitters in Belarus and under current conditions that is impossible."<br><br>But the radio station's backers in Poland are <br>convinced that there is an audience and that it is growing:<br><br>"I was in Belarus some time ago and met people <br>listening to the radio and glad of it," said <br>Michal Dworczyk, a key advisor on eastern <br>European issues to Polish Prime Minister Jaroslaw <br>Kaczynski. "The media role in the fight for <br>democracy is indisputable. For Belarus and its people, it is essential."<br><br>And Radio Racja's staff say they are not <br>discouraged and will keep broadcasting, even if the audience is tiny.<br><br>"We really want to show what is going on. We try <br>to be objective, asking for comment from the <br>government, but they won't talk to us," said <br>programme director Jana Kamienskaja, 37.<br><br>"'There is no news in the truth, and there is no <br>truth in the news' -- unfortunately this old <br>Soviet proverb is still valid in Belarus."<br><br>Belarus officials declined to comment on Radio Racja.<br><br>(Additional reporting by Andrei Makhovsky in <br>Minskand Gabriela Baczynska in Warsaw)<br><br><br>
