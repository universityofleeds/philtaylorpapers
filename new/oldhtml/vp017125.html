It is yet one more flagrant breach of all the proper conventions of war," Blair said.<br><br>But the family of one of the dead soldiers accused the prime minister of "lying".<br><br>The sister of sapper Luke Allsopp told the Daily Mirror tabloid that officers from his barracks told her he had died on the spot in battle.<br><br>At a news conference in London yesterday, armed forces minister Adam Ingram expressed "regret" for any distress that had been caused, while acknowledging that it had not formally been established that the soldiers were executed.<br><br>Asked about media reports of a pause of four to six days in the offensive towards Baghdad, British military spokesman Captain Al Lockwood told Sky News today: "I would not call it a pause. It is purely a case of shaping the battlefield, getting out our troops equipped and in the right place for the next part of the campaign."<br><br>Meanwhile, a British military spokesman today denied media reports that up to five other British soldiers had been captured in Basra, saying that no British troops had gone missing overnight.<br><br>But the defence ministry did confirm that one British soldier was missing, presumed dead, and four others were injured in a separate incident apparently involving friendly fire.<br><br>Britain's Press Association reported that the soldier was killed after a US A10 tankbuster plane targeted two armoured vehicles near Basra but the defence ministry said it was still investigating the circumstances.<br><br>The Daily Mirror tabloid reported today that the number of British troops serving in the Gulf could be cut dramatically from 45,000 to 5,000 if the US-led war against Iraq drags on for at least six months.<br><br>Britain's main anti-war group, the Stop The War Coalition, said protest marches against the conflict were being staged in at least 20 cities as a way of "expressing mounting anger at the news of the rising civilian casualties".<br><br>A rally was planned outside BBC television offices in London as part of a campaign for more media coverage of deaths and injuries to civilians.<br><br>AFP <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
