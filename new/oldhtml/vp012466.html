Benjamin Cossel, 122nd Mobile Public Affairs Detachment<br><br> TAJI, Iraq - With major combat operations complete, the war to win in Iraq has shifted to a different, more imprecise battleground. Leading the charge onto that hazy front -- the war to win the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people -- are the Soldiers of the Tactical Psychological Operations or 'Psyop' as they are more commonly known. <br>When one thinks of Psyop, visions of helicopters flying under the cover of night or men in black suits with dark sunglasses is likely the first image conjured.<br><br>'There's definitely an incorrect perception of what Psyop is,' said Sgt. 1st Class Douglas Urbanski, the non-commissioned officer-in-charge with the 345th Psyop Company of the 39th Brigade Combat Team. 'Much of the misconceptions about Psyop originate from the early Vietnam operations as well as our need to be somewhat secretive about our tactics 'we don't want the enemy ?psyop-ing' our own people.' <br><br>Misconceptions aside, as a force multiplier, a Tactical Psychological Operation Team (TPT) offers a commander many options on the battlefield. As part of cordon and search operations, a Psyop team broadcasts messages of cooperation, explaining to the citizenry why coalition forces are in the area and what they are doing. Working in more confrontational missions, the distinctive Psyop vehicle with a large speaker atop broadcasts surrender appeals, reminding the enemy of their severe numerical disadvantage and the likelihood of death. <br><br>To close with and destroy a target by conventional means is a tangible objective with little room for nuance and subtlety, the polar opposite of a typical Psyop mission.<br>Working within a community, cultivating relationships and trust takes time. Results of working within a village are not always immediate and often tracking those results is difficult. <br><br>Dismounting their vehicles and walking through the streets, Psyop team members contact people directly: in their shops, homes and on the streets. Often, a Psyop team is first into a village to assess the moods and opinions of the local population. For many citizens, this is their first face-to-face meeting with American Soldiers. <br><br>'The Army realized the potential power a credible information source could be on the battle field, but only if that information source was credible, not spreading lies and propaganda,' Urbanski said. <br><br>'It's really important that every soldier understand that they too play an important role in the Psyop mission,' Urbanski continued. 'You go out and punch an Iraqi citizen in the nose, that?s a negative Psyop encounter. You go out and give children candy, or have a cup of tea with a local, that's a positive Psyop encounter. We all have a part in this.'<br><br>
