Walker has taken the extraordinary step of telling federal agency heads that it is illegal to spend tax dollars on public relations promotions that are disguised as legitimate news reports.<br><br>The issue came up because the Bush administration paid public relations firms to create videos about Medicaid and an anti-drug campaign. The videos were moderated by actors who claimed to be news broadcasters reporting from Washington.<br><br>Subsequently, several television stations picked up the videos and aired them without knowing that the federal government, not a news organization, was the source of the material.<br><br>There is a word for governmentproduced materials intended to promote government programs with slick advertising campaigns. It's called propaganda.<br><br>News is something else entirely, and -- unlike government-commissioned propaganda -- taxpayers don't have to pick up the tab for legitimate news reporting.<br><br>"Prepackaged news stories can be utilized without violating the law, so long as there is clear disclosure to the television-viewing audience that this material was prepared by or in cooperation with the government department or agency," Walker wrote.<br><br>All Walker is really telling federal agencies is that if they want to produce propaganda, they have to disclose that it is, in fact, propaganda. They can't disguise propaganda as news reporting. That is a violation of the public trust.<br><br>Oh yes, and it's against the law.<br><br>
