Al Qaeda-linked groups also set up their own sites, which frequently have to move after being shut by Internet service providers.<br><br>The advertisements, however, could not be found on mainstream Islamist Web sites where al Qaeda and other affiliate groups post their statements.<br><br>Asharq al-Awsat said the advert did not specify salary amounts, but added: ``Every Muslim knows his life is not his, since it belongs to this violated Islamic nation whose blood is being spilled. Nothing should take precedence over this.''<br><br>The Front this week issued the second broadcast of a weekly Web news programme called Voice of the Caliphate, which it says aims to combat anti-Qaeda ``lies and propaganda'' on major global and Arab television channels such as CNN and Al Jazeera.<br><br>Last month it issued an English-language video on the Internet called Jihad Hidden Camera which showed sniping and bombing attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq, and carried comical sound effects as well as laugh tracks.<br><br>Al Qaeda and other groups have increasingly turontages of their military activities, including beheadings of hostages, on the Internet.<br><br><br><br>
