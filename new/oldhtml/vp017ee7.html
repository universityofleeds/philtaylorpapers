<A HREF="http://www.newkerala.com/news.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=89154"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=http://www.newkerala.com/news.php?action=fullnews&id=89154></A><br><br><br>Posted on 18 Jan 2006 # ANI   <br><br>US issues 'do's and don'ts' to sell its 'War on Terror' story <br><br><br>Washington: Karen Hughes, the lady in charge of media diplomacy in the 'War against Terrorism' has asked US foreign missions and officials who deal with the media or public to "get out in front of an issue or at best have a strong response to a negative story." <br><br>In a memo sent out by her office, Hughes has asked US representative to get "frequently in front of the cameras, in the columns of your local and regional press" and mobilise their staff "to wake up every morning with media in mind." <br><br>"Use what's out there. You are always on sure ground if you use what the President, Secretary Rice, Sean McCormack, or any USG spokesman has already said on a particular subject. You never need clearance to background a journalist though you should certainly pay careful attention to how your comments may be used," the Daily Times quoted her as saying. <br><br>"Think local. Because your key audience is your local - or regional - audience, you do not need clearance to speak to any local media, print, or television. And, you do not need clearance to speak to US media in your country if you are quoting a senior official who has spoken on the record on a particular subject," she added. <br><br>"Forceful advocacy of US interests and positions is critical to our effort to marginalise the extremists and share a positive vision of hope for all countries and people. I encourage you to take advantage of opportunities to speak out, and look forward to our aggressive promotion of US policy. Aggressive promotion of US policy - that's the problem at the moment," she further said. <br><br>Her other rules which goes by the name of Karen's rules further urges officials to have a "common sense to respond to natural disasters or tragedies" for which no State Department clearance is required. <br><br>"Officials are free to express condolences in the event of a loss, or express sympathy and support in response to a natural disaster," she said, however, adding that they should not commit US funds for support or relief without the approval of the State Department. <br><br>The final rule, she said was not to "make policy" in a sensitive area. Using ones own judgement and always "err on the side of caution", was the best way to wriggle out of a sticky situation, she said, adding that officials should freely contact her office if they were unable to formulate a response on their own. <br><br> <br><br><br><br><br>
