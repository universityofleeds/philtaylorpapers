GOEBBELS' PRINCIPLES OF PROPAGANDA <br>Based upon "Goebbels' Principles of Propaganda" by Leonard W. Doob published in "Public Opinion and Propaganda; A Book of Readings edited for The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues." <br> <br><br><br><br>GOEBBELS' PRINCIPLES OF PROPAGANDA<br><br><br>These principles purport to summarize what made Goebbels tick or fail to tick. They may be thought of as his intellectual legacy. Whether the legacy has been reliably deduced is a methodological question. Whether it is valid is a psychological matter. Whether or when parts of it should be utilized in a democratic society are profound and disturbing problems of a political and ethical nature.<br><br><br><br>1. Propagandist must have access to intelligence concerning events and public opinion.<br><br><br><br>2. Propaganda must be planned and executed by only one authority.<br><br>a. It must issue all the propaganda directives<br><br>b. It must explain propaganda directives to important officials and maintain their morale<br><br>c. It must oversee other agencies' activities which have propaganda consequences<br><br><br><br>3. The propaganda consequences of an action must be considered in planning that action.<br><br><br><br>4. Propaganda must affect the enemy's policy and action.<br><br>a. By suppressing propagandistically desirable material which can provide the enemy with useful intelligence<br><br>b. By openly disseminating propaganda whose content or tone causes the enemy to draw the desired conclusions<br><br>c. By goading the enemy into revealing vital information about himself<br><br>d. By making no reference to a desired enemy activity when any reference would discredit that activity<br><br><br><br>5. Declassified, operational information must be available to implement a propaganda campaign<br><br><br><br>6. To be perceived, propaganda must evoke the interest of an audience and must be transmitted through an attention-getting communications medium.<br><br><br><br>7. Credibility alone must determine whether propaganda output should be true or false.<br><br><br><br>8. The purpose, content and effectiveness of enemy propaganda; the strength and effects of an expose; and the nature of current propaganda campaigns determine whether enemy propaganda should be ignored or refuted.<br><br><br><br>9. Credibility, intelligence, and the possible effects of communicating determine whether propaganda materials should be censored.<br><br><br><br>10. Material from enemy propaganda may be utilized in operations when it helps diminish that enemy's prestige or lends support to the propagandist's own objective.<br><br><br><br>11. Black rather than white propaganda may be employed when the latter is less credible or produces undesirable effects.<br><br><br><br>12. Propaganda may be facilitated by leaders with prestige.<br><br><br><br>13. Propaganda must be carefully timed.<br><br>a. The communication must reach the audience ahead of competing propaganda.<br><br>b. A propaganda campaign must begin at the optimum moment<br><br>c. A propaganda theme must be repeated, but not beyond some point of diminishing effectiveness<br><br><br><br>14. Propaganda must label events and people with distinctive phrases or slogans.<br><br>a. They must evoke desired responses which the audience previously possesses<br><br>b. They must be capable of being easily learned<br><br>c. They must be utilized again and again, but only in appropriate situations<br><br>d. They must be boomerang-proof<br><br><br><br>15. Propaganda to the home front must prevent the raising of false hopes which can be blasted by future events.<br><br><br><br>16. Propaganda to the home front must create an optimum anxiety level.<br><br>a. Propaganda must reinforce anxiety concerning the consequences of defeat<br><br>b. Propaganda must diminish anxiety (other than concerning the consequences of defeat) which is too high and which cannot be reduced by people themselves<br><br><br><br>17. Propaganda to the home front must diminish the impact of frustration.<br><br>a. Inevitable frustrations must be anticipated<br><br>b. Inevitable frustrations must be placed in perspective<br><br><br><br>18. Propaganda must facilitate the displacement of aggression by specifying the targets for hatred.<br><br><br><br>19. Propaganda cannot immediately affect strong counter-tendencies; instead it must offer some form of action or diversion, or both.<br><br>
