There is no quick fix or victory: We need a clear, comprehensive and sustainable counterterrorism strategy.<br><br>To succeed, we must avoid misunderstanding the nature of the conflict. We are not engaged in a clash of civilizations or a war against the tactic of terrorism. Both of those definitions are too broad, and those conflicts unwinnable. Nor are we engaged in a fight against a fixed group of terrorists, or a small collection of states that sponsor terrorism. Both of those definitions are too narrow, and fail to encompass the expansive nature of the threat.<br><br>Our enemy is twofold: al-Qaeda, a stateless network of terrorists that struck us on Sept. 11, 2001; and a radical ideological movement in the Islamic world, inspired in part by al-Qaeda, which has spawned terrorist groups and violence around the globe. <br><br>The first enemy is weakened, but continues to be a threat; the second enemy is gathering, and will menace American people and interests long after Osama bin Laden and his cohorts are killed or captured. <br><br>Thus our strategy must match our means to two ends: dismantling the al-Qaeda network, and the longer-term goal of prevailing over the ideology that gives rise to terrorism.<br><br>What should this strategy look like? First, it must be balanced. The initial phase of our post-9/11 efforts rightly included robust military action to topple the Taliban and pursue al-Qaeda. But while military might can destroy terrorists and their safe havens, it cannot bear burdens as diverse as tracking down funds and changing hearts and minds. Long-term success demands all the elements of national power: diplomacy, intelligence, covert action, law enforcement, economic policy, foreign aid, public diplomacy and homeland defence. If we favour one tool while neglecting others, we leave ourselves vulnerable, and miss an opportunity to deploy the full U.S. arsenal of power.<br><br>These efforts must be integrated. We cannot succeed if the tools of government work in isolation from, or conflict with one another. We need focused institutions, White House co-ordination of our institutions of government, leaders who set clear priorities and vigorous congressional oversight. Just as we tailored our government to uniformly fight communism through areas as diverse as military strength, Voice of America, the Peace Corps and cultural centres, so, we must we fashion a government that works in unity to counter current threats.<br><br>Most importantly, we need to be a force for hope in the Islamic world. Millions of young Muslims grow up lacking political freedom, economic opportunity and hope. Instead of practical schooling, they often receive unrelenting messages of hatred and fanaticism and a tragic distortion of religion. They are taught to see the United States as sponsor of the world's ills and their personal suffering, and Islam as a means for war. Reversing this trend will take time, effort and resources -- a reconsideration of some of our alliances; outreach to moderate voices; support for educational reforms; the expansion of trade, jobs and opportunity; gradual political change; and the resolution of protracted conflicts.<br><br>Our overriding advantage is our message. Where the terrorists offer death, destruction, and regression, we can offer life, opportunity, progress and hope. A balanced, integrated, and international strategy must work consistently and persistently towards the realization of that message through the strengthening of Muslims who share these goals. They, not the terrorists, must win the clash within Islamic civilization. We must not seek a U.S. empire; we should seek a world where U.S. values thrive, and others benignly pursue their own definitions of liberty and happiness.<br><br>Terrorists threaten our lives, our economic well-being, and an international system built largely in our image. To defeat this threat, we must project our best hopes, not our worst fears. Success will require the informed consent and sustained support of the American people. That support will be forthcoming if our effort is focused, our sacrifice shared and our cause just.<br><br>Lee Hamilton is a former Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Indiana, and vice-chairman of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States.<br> <br><br><br>
