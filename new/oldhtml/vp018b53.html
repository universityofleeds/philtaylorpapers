Viewers greet September 11 TV coverage with cynicism <br><br>Claire Cozens<br>The Guardian, Friday October 26, 2001 <br><br><br><br>Consumers are becoming increasingly cynical about the news media in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, a leading advertising agency has warned.<br><br>Research by McCann-Erickson found many people were unhappy with the slick TV presentation of the New York disaster and wanted more straight forward education about the background to the crisis in the Middle East.<br><br>"While the striking visual images of the attack profoundly affected consumers, the news media's packaging and 'branding' of the event only seemed to heighten the sense of artificial reality," the report said.<br><br>"What was already an overwhelmingly powerful news event was made to appear like the Olympics of terror to many viewers, with flashy graphics and instant replays. To other viewers, the coverage seemed not only sensational but biased."<br><br>In the three weeks after September 11, the advertising agency conducted interviews in 37 countries in an effort to find out how consumers' attitudes had changed.<br><br>The results of the study suggested consumers' values had shifted dramatically since the US terrorist attacks, with a sense of patriotism running high and an increased scepticism about the worth of celebrities.<br><br>Predictably, the agency found people were keen to avoid travelling and wanted to stay close to their families.<br><br>But consumers were also more inclined to live for the moment, with many saying they would indulge in luxury items rather than save for the future.<br><br>"It is clear the events of September 11 have had a profound effect on consumers all over the world," said Kevin Allen, the European marketing director for McCann-Erickson.<br><br>"While this is only natural in the short term, there has been a tangible shift in priorities and values that is likely to have a long-term effect on how we communicate brands in the future."<br><br><br><br><br>
