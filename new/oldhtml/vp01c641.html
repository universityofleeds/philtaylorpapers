Iraq continues to be a ghastly war for the news media," said the INSI director, Rodney Pinder.<br><br>"We pleaded in vain at the start of this war for all sides to respect the safety of journalists. We again appeal to all of those with guns to recognise the neutrality of the news media and allow them to go about their business free from threat or harm."<br><br>The Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, today condemned Baldoni's murder as "an act of barbarity", after his captors acted on earlier threats that he would be executed if Italy did not withdraw its troops from Iraq.<br><br>The 56-year-old freelance journalist, who had recently been working for Milan weekly Diario, had been missing since August 19 when he disappeared en route to Najaf, the scene of fierce fighting between US troops and supporters of Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. <br><br>The INSI said frontline staff including reporters, cameramen, photographers and producers had borne the brunt of the killings.<br><br>The organisation calculates that 37 journalists have been killed since the war started in March last year and the ITN cameraman Fred Nerac is still missing.<br><br>Advertiser links <br>Internaxx, International Investing<br>Internaxx offshore broker.
