Some of them who were not predestined for martyrdom continue to cause losses to the enemies of Allah, the Americans, in Iraq, and carried out acts of heroism there. ..." <br>    The book goes on to implore supporters to rally to the cause and says more personnel are needed on the ground: "Jihad is what they need more than anything else, except food and water. <br>    "Although the al Qaeda organization fights to defend the [Islamic] nation, it does not fight on the nation's behalf; therefore, anyone who cannot join al Qaeda is not exempt from the obligation of jihad [until] he has done everything possible to search for jihad and did not succeed in joining any of its fronts. ..." <br>    Though this Web site has been offline since its operator, al-Ayyeri, a close friend of bin Laden, was killed in a shootout with police in Saudi Arabia in June, other al Qaeda-linked sites are not hard to find. <br>    One group that no longer feels the need to conceal its intentions is Hizb ut-Tahrir (HUT), which is using a series of six primary Web sites based in the United States, Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and Pakistan to attract volunteers to fight in Iraq. <br>    The group shares al Qaeda's ultimate goal of establishing a global Islamic dictatorship, called a caliphate, and it claims to have established a base in Iraq three months ago. <br>    Its call to jihad  -  titled "Annihilate the Fourth Crusade"  -  says: "Is it not a great shame that the armies of America and Britain are mobilized to commit aggression upon Muslim countries, one after another, whilst the armies of the Muslims lie dormant in their barracks, watching the shedding of Muslim blood? <br>    "Your previous generations, O Muslims, triumphed in the opening of lands and spread justice worldwide. Should you not go forth like them, following their footsteps, and annihilate the new crusaders? <br>    "Let the armies move to help the Muslims in Iraq for they seek your help." <br>    Based in Britain and claiming to be active in 40 countries, a recent Heritage Foundation report described the group as an "emerging threat to U.S. interests." <br>    The group has been banned in Germany and many other countries for its extreme views and is listed as a terrorist organization in Russia. <br>    In June, Russia's Federal Security Service, the successor to the KGB, arrested 51 HUT members in a raid in Moscow and recovered a cache of weapons and explosives. <br>    The group's founding leader is the radical Muslim cleric Omar Bakri Muhammad, who now heads a hard-line Islamic group in Britain called Al Muhajiroun, which has been dubbed the "north London Taliban." <br>    Muhammad is a key supporter of bin Laden and regularly shares platforms at meetings with Abu Hamza al-Masri, a fellow cleric who is wanted as a terrorist suspect in the United States. <br>    The group is active in 30 British cities and its members often boast about their recruitment activity. It is known in the intelligence community to be a prime supplier of foreign recruits to al Qaeda. <br>    "Sure, [the Al Muhajiroun] are a major recruiter for terrorists. It is common knowledge among counterterrorism operatives and agents that they are a front for bin Laden," said a U.S. government security and defense analyst. <br>    "There are clear al Qaeda ties by way of religious, criminal and foreign mujahideen links. Al Muhajiroun, being the bin Laden front in the UK, essentially connects all the dots." <br>    Since the U.S.-led war on terrorism began after the September 11, 2001, attacks, militant Islamic groups have been turning to the Internet increasingly to disseminate propaganda, recruitment material and raise funds. <br>    Web discussion forums and Hotmail-type e-mail accounts that require no proof of identification offer a good degree of security for the terrorists. <br>    <br><br><br><br>Copyright Â© 2003 News World Communications, Inc.
