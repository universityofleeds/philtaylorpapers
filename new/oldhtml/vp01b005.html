Today, many of our <br>biggest threats come not from other strong states but from subnational <br>groups such as Al Qaeda or from failing states that create fertile ground <br>from which they operate.<br><br>The Pentagon has reacted to the post-9/11 world by enlarging the Special <br>Operations Command and placing greater emphasis on language and cultural <br>education. It's not enough, but it's a beginning  -  and it's more than the <br>State Department has done so far. The Foreign Service remains trapped in a <br>framework straight out of the 19th century, producing diplomats whose <br>primary skill is liaison work with other diplomats. That leaves Foggy Bottom <br>woefully ill-equipped to deal with two particularly pressing challenges: <br>public diplomacy and nation-building.<br><br>Public diplomacy  -  the fancy name for speaking to the populace of foreign <br>countries, not just to their leaders  -  is more than ever necessary because <br>of the spread of democracy. Long gone are the days when autocrats such as <br>Otto von Bismarck and Prince Klemens von Metternich could determine their <br>countries' foreign policy pretty much on their own. Nowadays, getting the <br>support of foreign leaders usually requires getting the support of their <br>voters. But, as the run-up to the invasion of Iraq proved, that's not <br>something we're very adept at. Nor, as the aftermath of the invasion showed, <br>are we very good at nation-building. We need a new bureaucracy devoted to <br>this area so that the entire burden doesn't fall on the overstretched armed <br>forces.<br><br>Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has unveiled a number of <br>"transformational diplomacy" initiatives designed to address such <br>shortcomings. Noting that there are nearly as many State Department staffers <br>in Germany (population 82 million) as in India (population 1 billion), she <br>announced transfers from cushy Western embassies to more hardscrabble <br>outposts in the developing world. This will include opening a number of <br>one-person missions in cities of over 1 million people where the U.S. <br>currently has no representation at all. Foreign Service officers will be <br>required to serve in hardship posts in order to get promoted. The State <br>Department is also opening a regional public diplomacy center for the Middle <br>East, staffed by Arabic-speakers, and an Office of Reconstruction and <br>Stabilization, staffed by nation-building experts.<br><br>All good moves, but they don't go far enough. Public diplomacy, for one, has <br>suffered since the U.S. Information Agency was folded into the State <br>Department in 1999 in a misguided deal cooked up by the unlikely alliance of <br>then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.). <br>This led to a closing of American libraries all over the world and to a <br>downgrading of public communications in the overall scheme of things. <br>However much Rice or her successors may stress public diplomacy, it is <br>likely to remain a bastard stepchild in a bureaucracy run by Foreign Service <br>officers with other specialties. Why not reopen the USIA as a separate <br>agency with its own staff and a big boost in funding?<br><br>And why not set up a new nation-building department built, perhaps, on the <br>foundation of the Agency for International Development? The new Office of <br>Reconstruction and Stabilization is doing good work, but it is unlikely to <br>get sufficient support from Congress or its own department as long as it's <br>subsumed in a larger bureaucracy.<br><br>In any case, the skills needed for nation-building are more akin to those of <br>the old British Colonial Office than to those inculcated by the State <br>Department. We should open up our own version of the Colonial Office at <br>USAID. Instead, the trend seems to be toward more closely integrating USAID <br>into the State Department, repeating the mistake that was made with the <br>USIA.<br><br>Don't nod off. Diplomacy may not be sexy stuff, but it is vitally important <br>if we are to deal with looming problems before they turn into a crisis <br>requiring tens of thousands of U.S. troops to fix. We actually need to spend <br>more and hire more people to tackle these issues. The entire international <br>affairs budget  -  which includes funding not only for the State Department <br>and other agencies but also for foreign aid  -  is just $35 billion, compared <br>with about $500 billion in defense spending. And the State Department has <br>just 13,000 employees, not enough to fill one Army division.<br><br>But before making a bigger commitment to diplomacy and related disciplines, <br>we need to make sure we have the right structure in place to address the <br>challenges of the 21st century.<br><br><br><br>
