Lords Percy Percy and Edmund Blackadder are<br>	 eating breakfast.]<br> <br>Percy:	I must say, Edmund, it was jolly nice of you to ask me to share your<br>	breakfast before the rigours of the day begin.<br> <br>Edmund:  Well, it is said, Percy, that civilised man seeks out good and<br>	 intelligent company, so that, through learned discourse, he may<br>	 rise above the savage and closer to God.<br> <br>Percy:	Yes, I've heard that.<br> <br>Edmund:  Personally, however, I like to start the day with a total dickhead<br>	 to remind me I'm best.<br> <br>Percy:  Beshrew me, Edmund!  You're in good fooling this morning.<br> <br>Edmund:  Don't say `beshrew me', Percy -- only stupid actors say `beshrew me'.<br> <br>Percy:  Oh, how I would love to be an actor!  I had a great talent for it in<br>	my youth -- I was the man of a thousand faces.<br> <br>Edmund:  How'd you come to choose the ugly mug you've got now, then?<br>	 [He begins reading a note.]<br> <br>Percy:  Hah hah! Tush, My Lord.<br> <br>Edmund:  ...and don't say `tush', either!  It's only a short step from `tush'<br>	 to `hey nonny nonny'; and then, I'm afraid, I'll shall have to call<br>	 the police.<br>	 [Looks at the note once more.]<br>	 Well!  God pats me on the head and says, "Good boy, Edmund!"<br> <br>Percy:	My Lord...?<br> <br>Edmund:  My aunt and uncle, Lord and Lady Whiteadder, the two most fanatical<br>	 puritans in England, have invited themselves to dinner here tonight.<br> <br>Percy:	But aren't they the most frightful bores?<br> <br>Edmund:  Yep, but they have one great redeeming feature -- their wallets.<br>	 More capacious than an elephant's scrotum, and just as difficult<br>	 to get your hands on...at least until now, for, tonight, they wish<br>	 to discuss my inheritance.  [runs his fingers through his hair]<br> <br>Percy:  [stands quickly] Hey nonny nonny, My Lord! Good news!<br>	[he holds out a hand as though expecting Edmund to shake it]<br> <br>Edmund:  [calls] Baldrick!<br> <br>	[Baldrick enters, wearing an apparatus on his head which is dangling<br>	 a piece of cheese from the end of his nose.  Edmund begins to speak<br>	 about something, then notices.]<br> <br>Edmund:  [calmly]  Why have you got a piece of cheese tied to the end<br>	 of your nose?<br> <br>Baldrick:  To catch mice, My Lord.  I lie on the floor with my mouth open<br>	   and hope they scurry in.<br> <br>Edmund:  ...and do they?<br> <br>Baldrick:  Not yet, My Lord.<br> <br>Edmund:  Well, I'm not surprised -- your breath comes straight from Satan's<br>	 bottom, Baldrick.  The only sort of mouse you're going to catch is<br>	 one without a nose.<br> <br>Baldrick:  That's a pity, because the nose is the best bit on a mouse.<br> <br>Edmund:  Any bit of a mouse would seem like luxury compared to what Percy<br>	 and I must eat tonight.  We are entertaining puritan vegetable folk,<br>	 Balders; and that means no meat.<br> <br>Baldrick:  In that case, I shall prepare my Turnip Surprise.<br> <br>Edmund:  and the surprise is...?<br> <br>Baldrick:  ...there's nothing else in it except the turnip.<br> <br>Edmund:  So, in other words, the Turnip Surprise would be...a turnip.<br> <br>Baldrick:  [realisation]  Oh yeah...<br> <br>	[There is a knock at the door.]<br> <br>Edmund:  Get the door, Baldrick, get the door...<br> <br>	[Baldrick leaves.]<br> <br>Percy:  Well, now, if things go as planned tonight, it seems congratulations<br>	are in order...<br>	[he holds out a hand as though expecting Edmund to shake it]<br> <br>Edmund:  Nice try, Percy, but forget it -- you're not getting a penny.<br>	 [he goes to sit in the chair at the doorway to the room]<br> <br>	[A tremendous noise of wood being bent and broken fills the room.<br>	 Baldrick enters, carrying a door.]<br> <br>Edmund:  [looks at what Baldrick is carrying; is not surprised; speaks calmly]<br>	 Baldrick, I would advise you to make the explanation you are about<br>	 to give phenomenally good.<br> <br>Baldrick:  You said, "Get the door."<br> <br>Edmund:  Not good enough.  You're fired.<br> <br>Baldrick:  But, My Lord, I've been in your family since 1532!<br> <br>Edmund:  So has syphilis.  Now get out.<br> <br>Baldrick:  [obscured by laughter], My Lord.  [starts to leave but returns]<br>	   Oh, by the way: there was a messenger outside when I got the door.<br>	   He says the Queen wants to see you; Lord Melchett is very sick.<br> <br>Edmund:  [stands up excited]  Really...!<br> <br>Baldrick:  Yeah -- he's at Death's door.<br> <br>Edmund:  Well, my faithful old reinstated family retainer, let's go and<br>	 open it for him, then!<br> <br> <br>	[Scene changes to a large room.  Melchett is lying on a bed with<br>	 a hand on his head.  Queen Elizabeth is fanning his face with her<br>	 hand.  Nursie pushes on Melchett's stomach.  Edmund enters.]<br> <br>Queen:  Edmund!  Quick! Quick!  Melchett's dying!  We must do something!<br> <br>Edmund:  Well, yes, of course... er, some sort of celebration...<br>	 But let's wait until he's actually snuffed it, shall we?<br> <br>Queen:  Nursie's old methods don't seem to be working...<br> <br>Nursie:  Come on, little tummy...<br> <br>Queen:	[goes across the room, to speak privately with Edmund]<br>	It all started last night at about two o'clock.  I was tucked<br>	into bed having this absolutely scrummy dream about ponies when<br>	I was wakened by a terrific banging from Lord Melchett.<br> <br>Edmund:  [grins at the double entendre]  Well! I never knew he had it in him.<br> <br>Queen:  It's true, I promise!  He was banging on the castle gate, falling<br>	over, and singing a strange song about a girl who possessed something<br>	called a...dicky-di-do?<br> <br>Edmund:  Oh, yes, it's a lovely old hymn, isn't it...  [returns to the bed]<br>	 Well, Ma'am, I think I know what's wrong with Lord Melchett,<br>	 and, unfortunately, it isn't fatal.<br> <br>Queen:	Well, hurry up and cure the horrible man -- I'm fed up with him lying<br>	there moaning and groaning...<br> <br>Nursie:  ...and letting off such great and fruitsome flappy woof-woofs!<br>	 One can scarcely...one can't believe one's tiny nosy!<br> <br>Edmund:  The truth is: Lord Melchett just can't take his ale.<br> <br>Melchett:  [sitting up]  Madam, I protest!  I may be a little delicate this<br>	   morning, but what I drank last night would have floored a<br>	   rhinocerous!<br> <br>Edmund:  ...if it was allergic to lemonade...<br> <br>Melchett:  It's Blackadder here who can't take his ale -- he's famous for it!<br> <br>Edmund:  Oh yeah?<br> <br>Melchett:  Yeah!<br> <br>Edmund:  Yeah?<br> <br>Melchett:  Yeah!<br> <br>Queen:  Oh, [???] this is so exciting -- the boys are getting tough!<br> <br>Melchett:  Well, I'm sure we all remember the shame and embarrassment of the<br>	   visit of the King of Austria when Blackadder was found wandering<br>	   naked among the corridors of Hampton Court singing, "I'm Merlin,<br>	   The Happy Pig!"<br> <br>Edmund:  So, what did you have last night, then? a whole half-pint of <br>	 potato juice?<br> <br>Melchett:  On the contrary! I had two flagons of claret and a double helping<br>	   of curried turtle!  I can assure you: it's no holds barred with<br>	   us at the annual communion-wine tasting.<br> <br>Edmund:  Annual! Hah!  For me and the wild boys, every night is drinking<br>	 night!<br> <br>Melchett:  Says who?<br> <br>Edmund:  Says me!<br> <br>Melchett:  Says you?<br> <br>Edmund:  Yeah!<br> <br>Melchett:  [expecting that Edmund is bragging]  eeaaaahh...<br> <br>Edmund:  You ought to come around sometime and have a look at the<br>	 underside of >my< table!<br> <br>Melchett:  Bah...<br> <br>Queen:  ...tonight!!!<br> <br>Melchett:  [suddenly in his senses, speaks feebly]  Er, tonight?<br> <br>Edmund:  [not in his senses]  Yeah! Come on, Melchy -- what are you<br>	 scared of?<br> <br>Queen:  Perhaps you're right.  [in a child's taunt] Perhaps he's a [????].<br> <br>Melchett:  Oh, all right then -- tonight.  I'll be there.<br> <br>Queen:  Hurray.  and last one under the table gets...ten thousand florins<br>	from the loser.<br> <br>Edmund:  [shocked]  Ma'am...?  Er... right...  Well, I'll get the beer in,<br>	 then.  [bows, puts a thumb to his nose and wiggles his fingers at<br>         Melchett.  Leaves]<br> <br>Queen:  [Stands at the door]  Nursie...<br> <br>Nursie:  Hmm?  [goes to speak privately with Queen]<br> <br>Queen:	[whispering]  Do you know what I'm going to do?<br> <br>Nursie:  What?<br> <br>Queen:  I'm going to go along and find out exactly what happens at these<br>	boys' nights.<br> <br>Nursie:  Good idea, poppet.<br> <br>Queen:	...and I'll wear a cloak with a cowl, so no-one will recognise me.<br> <br>Nursie:  Oh, that's another good idea.  You're so clever today, you better<br>	 be careful your foot doesn't fall off.<br> <br>Queen:  Does that happen when you have lots of brilliant ideas?<br>	Your foot falls off?<br> <br>Nursie:  It certainly does.  My brother, he had this brilliant idea of<br>	 cutting his toenails with a scythe, and >his< foot fell off...<br> <br> <br>	[Scene changes to Edmund's house.  Percy has quill in hand, taking<br>	 notes for Edmund, who paces the room.]<br> <br>Edmund:  Right, now; the sort of person we're looking for is an aggressive<br>	 drunken lout with the intelligence of a four year old and the<br>	 sexual sophistication of a donkey.<br> <br>Percy:  [thinks]  Cardinal Woolsey...  [writes]<br> <br>Edmund:  [calls]  Baldrick!<br> <br>	[Baldrick enters, but his apparatus is dangling a mouse this time.]<br> <br>Baldrick:  My Lord...?<br> <br>Edmund:  Why?<br> <br>Baldrick:  I got fed up with the all-mouse diet, My Lord.  I thought I'd try<br>	   cat for variety.<br> <br>Edmund:  Good. Well done. and now, returning to the real world: Do you have<br>	 a knife?<br> <br>Baldrick:  Yeah.<br> <br>Edmund:  Good, because I wish to quickly send off some party invitations,<br>	 and, to make them look particularly tough, I wish to write them<br>	 in blood -- your blood, to be precise.<br> <br>Baldrick:  So, how much blood will you actually be requiring, My Lord?<br> <br>Edmund:  Oh, nothing much -- just a small puddle.<br> <br>Baldrick:  Will you want me to cut anything off? an arm or a leg, for<br>	   instance?<br> <br>Edmund:  Oh, good lord, no -- a little prick should do.<br> <br>Baldrick:  Very well, My Lord; I am your bondsman and must obey. [sticks his<br>	   knife down his trousers and begins sawing]<br> <br>Edmund:  For God's sake, Baldrick! I meant a little prick on your finger!<br> <br>Baldrick:  [nearly crying]  I haven't got one there!<br> <br>Edmund:  Forget it, forget it...  [motions for Baldrick to leave]<br> <br>Baldrick:  Thank you, My Lord.  [leaves]<br> <br>Edmund:  Right, now; Perce... How's this list going?<br> <br>Percy:	Oh, very well indeed.  I thought we could invite my girlfriend,<br>	Gwendoline...<br> <br>Edmund:  Sorry -- no chicks.  Who else?<br> <br>Percy:  Well, that's about as far as I'd got, actually.<br> <br>Edmund:  Right.  I'll dictate.  First: Simon Partridge.<br> <br>Percy:  Oh, not Farter's Parters, also known as Mr Ostrich...!<br> <br>Edmund:  Even he...<br> <br>Percy:  But he's a fearful oik!<br> <br>Edmund:  Takes one to know one, Perce.  Secondly: Sir Geoffrey Piddle.<br> <br>Percy:	Here's-To-The-Health-Of-Cardinal-Chunder Piddle?<br> <br>Edmund:  The very same...  and, thirdly: Freddie Frobisher, the Flatulent<br>	 Hermit of Lindisfarne.<br> <br>Percy:  [holds his nose]  Oh, paugh paugh!<br> <br>Edmund:  Right. That should do the trick.<br> <br>Percy:	Oh! and, of course, Lord and Lady Whiteadder, who'll be coming<br>	anyway...<br> <br>Edmund:  Oh y--  ...oh, no...<br> <br> <br>	[Scene changes to the throne room.  Queen is on the throne, Nursie<br>	 is in her normal chair to the left (she is knitting), and Edmund<br>	 is kneeled on one knee before Queen.]<br> <br>Queen:	I must say, Edmund, it does look a teeny bit like trying to get<br>	out of it.<br> <br>Edmund:  [frantic]  Quite the wrong impression, Ma'am.  I just want to<br>	 make it another night, that's all.<br> <br>Nursie:  Certainly not!<br> <br>Queen:	I beg your pardon...?<br> <br>Nursie:  Well, it's just one excuse after another, isn't it?  Next thing,<br>	 he'll be trying to get out of having his bath altogether.<br> <br>	[Edmund is quite confused.]<br> <br>Queen:	He isn't talking about baths, Nursie.<br> <br>Nursie:  Well, he should be!  How else is he going to keep clean?<br>	 Soon he'll be saying he doesn't want his nappy changed!<br> <br>Queen:  Lord Blackadder doesn't wear a nappy.<br> <br>Nursie:  Well, in that case, it's even more important that he has a bath!<br> <br>Queen:	[tired of the interruptions]  Oh, shut up, Nursie.<br>	[to Edmund]  I know why you want to get out of it, because I<br>	remember the last time you had a party -- I found you face-down<br>	in a puddle, wearing a pointy hat and singing a song about goblins.<br> <br>Edmund:  [stands]  Yes, all right! All right!  Tonight it is.<br> <br>Queen:  [smiles, a bit turned on]  Oh, Edmund... I do love it when you get<br>	cross.  Sometimes I think about having you executed just to see the<br>	expression on your face.<br> <br>	[Edmund grins uneasily.]<br> <br> <br>	[Scene changes to the room in Edmund's house to the right after<br>	 entering through the main door.  Edmund, Baldrick and Percy enter.<br>	 Baldrick no longer wears his apparatus.]<br> <br>Edmund:  Right, now; let's make sure you've got this.  We are having two<br>	 parties here tonight...<br> <br>Baldrick:  Right.<br> <br>Percy:  Right.<br> <br>Edmund:  ...and they must be kept completely separate.<br> <br>Baldrick & Percy:  Right.<br> <br>Edmund:  Firstly, a total piss-up -- involving beer throwing, broken furniture<br>	 and wall-to-wall vomiting -- to be held here in Baldrick's bedroom.<br> <br>Baldrick:  Oh, thank you very much, My Lord!  [Percy pats him on the shoulder<br>	   in congratulations]<br> <br>	[Edmund goes to the main living room of the house (where the previous<br>	 house scenes have taken place).]<br> <br>Edmund:  Secondly, Percy will join me in here for the gourmet turnip eating.<br>	 Is the Turnip Surprise ready?<br> <br>	[Baldrick and Percy begin giggling.]<br> <br>Baldrick:  Yes, it is, My Lord.<br> <br>Edmund:  Then what is so funny?<br> <br>Percy:  Well, My Lord, while Baldrick and I were preparing the Turnip<br>	Surprise, >we< had a surprise -- we came across a turnip that was<br>	exactly the same shape...as a thingy!<br> <br>	[Percy and Baldrick laugh.]<br> <br>Edmund:  [not amused]  ...a thingy...<br> <br>Baldrick:  ...a great big thingy!  It was terrific.<br> <br>Edmund:  Size is no guarantee of quality, Baldrick.  Most horses are very<br>	 well endowed, but that does not necessarily make them sensitive<br>	 lovers.  I trust you have removed this hilarious item...?<br> <br>Baldrick:  Oh, yes, yes, My Lord.<br> <br>Edmund:  Good, because there's nothing more likely to stop an inheritance<br>	 than a thingy-shaped turnip.<br> <br>Percy:  Absolutely, Edmund.  ...but it was jolly funny!  [laughs more]<br> <br>Edmund:  Yes, yes, yes...<br> <br>Baldrick:  I found it particularly ironic, My Lord, because I've got<br>	   a thingy that's shaped like a turnip!<br> <br>Edmund:  Yes, all right...<br> <br>Baldrick:  I'm quite [?] at parties...<br> <br>Edmund:  [not interested]  are you...<br> <br>Baldrick:  Yeah -- I hide in the vegetable rack and frighten the children.<br> <br>Edmund:  What fun...  Perhaps you've forgotten that I'm meant to be having<br>	 a drinking competition here tonight with Lord Melchett, and ten<br>	 thousand florins are at stake!<br> <br>Baldrick:  Oh dear...<br> <br>Edmund:  What do you mean?<br> <br>Baldrick:  Well, firstly: you haven't got ten thousand florins; and,<br>	   thirdly: one drop of the ale and you fall flat on your face<br>	   and start singing that song about the goblin.<br> <br>Edmund:  That's nonsense.  ... ... ... but just in case it's true--<br> <br>Baldrick:  [to Percy]  It is true -- I saw it!<br> <br>Edmund:  Yes, all right, all right, it's true, it's true...<br>	 So, the plan is: When I call for my Incredibly Strong Ale,<br>	 you must pass me water in an ale bottle.  Have you got that?<br> <br>Baldrick:  Yeah -- when you call for ale, I pass water.<br> <br>Edmund:  Percy, your job is to stay here and suck up to my aunt.<br> <br>Percy:  [tries to act suave]  Ah, I think you can trust me to know how to<br>	handle a woman.<br> <br>Edmund:  Oh god...<br> <br>	[There is a knock at the door.]<br> <br>Edmund:  Right, here goes...<br> <br>	[Edmund goes to the front door.  Baldrick brushes Edmund's clothing<br>	 for a moment.]<br> <br>Edmund:  [motioning for Baldrick to stop]  It's all right...<br> <br>	[Baldrick opens the closet door and tosses the brush in.<br>	 Edmund opens the front door.  Aunt and Uncle's clothing is<br>	 all white, with a large cross around the neck, a cross sticking<br>	 out of each shoulder, and a white helmet with a cross sticking<br>	 out the top.]<br> <br>Edmund:  Uncle! Aunt!  Greetings!  How nice it is to see you.<br>	 [He leans over and kisses Aunt on each cheek.]<br> <br>Aunt:  [slaps Edmund twice]  Wicked child!!!  Don't lie!  Everyone hates us,<br>       and you know it!<br> <br>Edmund:  Oh yes.  Er, may I introduce my friend Lord Percy...?<br> <br>Percy:  [suave]  Well well well, Eddy!  You didn't tell me you had<br>	such a good-looking aunt!<br> <br>	[Edmund waves at him to shut up.  Aunt is shocked.]<br> <br>Percy:	Good morrow to thee, gorgeousness!  I know what I like,<br>	and I like what I see!<br> <br>Aunt:  [slaps Percy]  Be gone, Satan!  [heads to the main room]<br> <br>Edmund:  Er, yes, well, well, I hope you had a pleasant inheritance...<br>	 Did I say `inheritance'?  I meant `journey'.<br>	 [motions around the table]  If you'd just like to help yourself<br>	 to a legacy -- er, a chair...<br> <br>Aunt:  `Chair'?  You have chairs in your house?<br> <br>Edmund:  Oh, yes.<br> <br>Aunt:  [slaps him twice]  Wicked child!!!  Chairs are an invention of Satan!<br>       In our house, Nathaniel sits on a spike!<br> <br>Edmund:  ...and yourself...?<br> <br>Aunt:  I sit on Nathaniel -- two spikes would be an extravagance.<br> <br>Edmund:  Well, quite.<br> <br>Aunt:  I will suffer comfort this once -- we shall just have to stick<br>       forks in our legs between courses.  [sits]  I trust you remember<br>       we eat no meat...?  [Uncle, off-camera, has sat too.]<br> <br>Edmund:  Heaven forbid, no!  [Goes to sit at the end of the table;<br>	 Percy sits at the other end]  Here, we feast only on God's<br>	 lovely turnip -- mashed.<br> <br>Aunt:  [stands suddenly]  Mashed?!<br> <br>Edmund:  Yes...<br> <br>Aunt:  [slaps him twice]  Wicked child!!!  Mashing is also the work of<br>       Beelzebub -- for Satan saw God's blessed turnip, and he envied it<br>       and mashed it to spoil its sacred shape.<br> <br>Edmund:  Ah.<br> <br>Aunt:  I shall have my turnip as God intended.  [sits]<br> <br>Edmund:  Fine.  [calls]  Baldrick!<br> <br>	[Baldrick enters.]<br> <br>Baldrick:  My Lord...?<br> <br>Edmund:  Will you fetch my dear aunt a raw turnip, please?<br> <br>Baldrick:  Well, we've only got the one that--<br> <br>Edmund:  [Interrupts, wanting to show authority in front of his servant<br>         to Aunt and Uncle]  Just do it, thank you.<br> <br>	[Baldrick leaves.]<br> <br>Edmund:  [to Uncle]  So, Uncle, will you have your turnip mashed, or as<br>	 God intended?<br> <br>Aunt:  He will not answer you; he has taken a vow of silence.<br>       [Uncle looks quite unhappy]  I believe that silence is golden.<br> <br>	[Edmund begins to say something like "Oh, I see" but decides it's<br>	 better to be golden.  Aunt gives him an approving look.]<br> <br>	[Pause]<br> <br>	[Edmund, still not wanting to speak, but also wanting to get to the<br>	 topic he wants to talk about, clears his thoat, making the word<br>	 `inheritance' as he does so.]<br> <br>	[There is a noisy knock on the front door.]<br> <br>Aunt:  Edmund! I trust you have invited no other guests...?<br> <br>Edmund:  Oh, certainly not!<br> <br>Aunt:  Good -- for where there are other guests there are people to<br>       fornicate with!<br> <br>Edmund:  Well, quite.<br> <br>	[More knocking on the front door.]<br> <br>Edmund:  I'll just go and tell them to fornicate off.  [motions over to<br>	 Percy]  Lord Percy...  [leaves]<br> <br>Percy:  Erm, er, yes, er, well, Lord Whiteadder, er, a vow of silence...<br>	Now, that's quite an interesting thing... Tell me about it.<br> <br>	[In the hall, Edmund leaves his bedroom wearing a pair of false<br>	 breasts over his clothing, then goes to the front door and opens<br>	 it.  Monk, Partridge (holding an ostrich feather) and Piddle enter,<br>	 also wearing false breasts over their clothing.  Monk wears a hat<br>	 with a chicken on it; Partridge wears a hat with a model of a ship<br>	 on it, and Piddle wears a hat with bells and something I can't<br>	 describe -- like a May pole.  They sing.]<br> <br>	"Happy Birthday to you!<br>	 Happy Birthday to you!<br>	 Happy Birthday, Eddy-baby!<br>	 Happy Birthday to you!"<br> <br>	[In the main room, Aunt can hear, and doesn't know what to make of it;<br>	 Percy is unable to think of an explanation.]<br> <br>Edmund:  [loudly so Aunt can hear]  But it's not my birthday, Arch Deacon!<br> <br>	[In the main room, Aunt nods and smiles.  Percy is relieved.]<br> <br>	[Edmund leads the group into Baldrick's bedroom.]<br> <br>Edmund:  Well, well, get stuck in, boys.<br> <br>Partridge:  `Stuck in'! Way-hey! Get it?<br> <br>Monk:  No...  [Piddle doesn't, either]<br> <br>Partridge:  Well, it sounds a bit rude, doesn't it!  `Stuck >in<'!<br> <br>	[The boozers laugh, as there's a knock at the front door.]<br> <br>Edmund:  Er, sorry -- back in a tick.  [leaves]<br> <br>Partridge:  Way-hey! `Tick', eh, lads?  Now; that sounds a bit rude,<br>	    doesn't it...  That sounds a bit like `bum'.<br> <br>	[They laugh.]<br> <br>	[Edmund, in the hallway, opens the front door.  Melchett enters.]<br> <br>Edmund:  Ah, Melchett -- late, I see, to avoid the early drinking.<br>	 Oh, Melchy, you really are a beginner -- you're not even<br>	 wearing a pair of comedy breasts!<br> <br>Melchett:  [opens his coat to reveal gold false breasts]<br>	   Au contraire, Blackadder...<br> <br>Edmund:  Yes, well, well, let's wait until we get down to the really serious<br>	 drinking, shall we?<br> <br>Melchett:  [has moved to the door of the main room]  In here?<br> <br>Edmund:  Er, no, no, it's this way.  [shows Melchett to Baldrick's bedroom]<br>	 Here we are.<br> <br>	[As they enter, the three boozers are bent over, shaking their<br>	 backsides and saying "Whoa!" rising in pitch.]<br> <br>Melchett:  Good evening, er...<br> <br>Edmund:  Lads, this is Lord Melchett.<br> <br>	[They cheer.]<br> <br>Edmund:  Er, give him a large one, will you?<br> <br>Partridge:  `Large one'! Way-hey! Get it?<br> <br>Piddle:  No...<br> <br>Partridge:  Yes you do!  `Large one'!  Sounds a bit rude!<br> <br>Piddle:  Oh yes!  `Large one'!<br> <br>	[The boozers laugh.]<br> <br>Edmund:  You may find the conversation a bit above your head at first,<br>	 Melchy, but you'll soon get used to it.  Well, er, [taking a mug<br>	 and raising it] down the hatch!<br> <br>	[The boozers cheer, as Edmund leaves and tosses the drink in the<br>	 closet.  He goes to the door of the main room, about to remove<br>	 the breasts, when there is a rhythmic knock on the door.  In the<br>	 main room, Percy knocks an answering rhythm on the table.  Edmund<br>	 opens the front door.  Queen is wrapped in a cowled cloak, and<br>	 tries to disguise her voice.]<br> <br>Queen:  I heard there was a party on.<br> <br>Edmund:  [not knowing who it is]  No. Yes, there are two, and you are<br>	 invited to neither.  [begins to close the door, but Queen speaks]<br> <br>Queen:  I'm a friend of Lord Percy.<br> <br>Edmund:  Oh, you must be Gwendoline!  You were invited anyway.  Come in, do.<br> <br>Queen:  Thank you very much.  [enters]<br> <br>Edmund:  It's in here...  [opens the closet door, pushes Queen in, closes the<br>	 closet door and locks it]<br> <br>	[Edmund enters the main room again at last, but has forgotten about<br>	 his false breasts.]<br> <br>Edmund:  I'm sorry about that.  [obscured by laughter]  [sits]<br> <br>Percy:  [with his hand over his mouth, tries to warn Edmund]<br>	agh... agh...aaagh!<br> <br>Edmund:  [to Uncle]  Sorry, he's sick -- leprosy...of the brain.<br> <br>Aunt:  That, or what he is trying to tell you is that you appear to be<br>       wearing a pair of devil's dumplings!<br> <br>Edmund:  [looks down at the breasts, double-takes]  Oh my god -- my earmuffs<br>	 have fallen down!  [puts the breasts over his head so they cover<br>	 his ears]  It's getting, er, would you like a pair?  It is getting<br>	 rather cold... [??]<br> <br>Aunt:  No thank you!  Cold is God's way of telling us to burn more catholics!<br> <br>Edmund:  Well, quite -- which reminds me, Aunty--<br> <br>Aunt:  [stands up]  Don't call me `Aunty'!!!  [slaps him twice]<br>       `Aunt' is a relative, and relatives are evidence of sex,<br>       and sex is hardly a fitting subject for the dinner table.  [sits]<br> <br>Edmund:  ...or, indeed, any table.<br> <br>Percy:  ...except, perhaps, a table in a brothel.<br> <br>Edmund:  [kicks Percy off his chair]  Oh dear, Percy, it seems you have<br>	 fallen off your chair.<br> <br>	[Baldrick enters, carrying a plate on which sits the thingy-shaped<br>	 turnip]<br> <br>Edmund:  Now then, what was I saying?  [sees the turnip and speaks without<br>	 a pause]  Oh my god...<br> <br>Baldrick:  [to Aunt]  Your turnip, My Lady...<br> <br>Aunt:  [picks up the turnip, holds it in front of her, her eyes wide]<br>       Very good! Very good!  [bites into it, then points it at Uncle,<br>       and speaks to him]  You know, Nathaniel, it takes me right back<br>       to our wedding night.<br> <br>	[Uncle's eyes open wide, in surprise.  Baldrick has left.]<br> <br>Aunt:  [to Edmund]  We had raw turnips that night.<br> <br>	[Drunken cheering is heard.]<br> <br>Aunt:  What was that?<br> <br>Edmund:  What was what?<br> <br>Aunt:  That noise.<br> <br>Edmund:  Noise?  [turns his head and lifts a breast off an ear]<br>	 Did you hear a noise, Percy?<br> <br>Percy:  No...<br> <br>Edmund:  Good.<br> <br>Percy:  ...apart from that colossal drunken roar.<br> <br>Edmund:  [kicks Percy off his chair]  Oh, >that< noise -- it's the<br>	 catholics next door, I'm afraid.<br> <br>Aunt:  [stands angrily, makes a very disapproving noise]<br> <br>Edmund:  Er, but, I'll, I'll just go and burn them.  Back in a minute.<br>	 [stands]  Percy...  [leaves]<br> <br>	[In the hall, Baldrick replaces Edmund's false breasts, and fits a<br>	 false nose to Edmund's forehead, then dusts him off a bit.  As<br>	 Edmund goes down the hall, he hears pounding from inside the closet.<br>	 He opens the closet door.]<br> <br>Edmund:  Yes?<br> <br>Queen:  I'm suffocating!<br> <br>Edmund:  [still not knowing who it is]  Well, thank God you knocked.  [takes<br>	 her out of the closet]  Come on, now, now, take a deep breath.<br>	 [she does]  ...and another...  [she does]  Better?<br> <br>Queen:  Yes.<br> <br>Edmund:  Good.  [pushes her back into the closet, and closes the door again]<br> <br>	[Back in the main room, Percy still tries to be good company.]<br> <br>Percy:  Mind you, I'll say one thing for catholics: they do have<br>	natural rhythm!  [Aunt leans toward him menacingly; he leans away]<br> <br>	[In Baldrick's bedroom, Edmund has returned; they're all wearing<br>	 false noses on their foreheads now, although Partridge's is coming<br>	 out the side of his head.]<br> <br>Melchett:  I notice you're not drinking, Blackadder...<br> <br>Edmund:  Oh, don't you worry about me, Melchers -- I'm holding my own here.<br> <br>Partridge:  Way-hey! `Holding my own'!  Now, that sounds >incredibly< rude!<br> <br>	[The boozers laugh.]<br> <br>Edmund:  Yes, well, I never went to university, of course.<br> <br>Melchett:  [standing]  Er, Blackadder, it doesn't explain why you're not<br>	   drinking with us.<br> <br>Edmund:  Ah yes, no, that's what I actually came to talk to you about,<br>	 you see.  What do you say about the idea of ten minutes absolute<br>	 silence to get some really serious drinking in?<br> <br>	[The boozers cheer, then realise that that's noisy, so they all go<br>	 `shh!' rather messily.]<br> <br>Edmund:  Yes... I said, "Please give me silence" -- not "drench me with<br>	 dribble."<br> <br>Melchett:  [hands Edmund a silver goblet]  Well, now, here's a nice glass<br>	   of cider.<br> <br>Edmund:  Oh, only cider?  I'm going to go and put some brandy in it!<br> <br>	[The boozers cheer and go `shh!' again, as Edmund leaves.]<br> <br>	[Edmund enters the hallway, briefly opens the closet door and tosses<br>	 the cider in.  Queen shrieks upon getting wet.  Edmund removes his<br>	 false nose and breasts, heading for the main room.  In Baldrick's<br>	 bedroom, meanwhile, the boozers and Melchett are sitting down<br>	 like in a rowboat.  A barrel of something bursts open.  Edmund<br>	 enters the main room once again.]<br> <br>Edmund:  So, how are we all going, then?<br> <br>Aunt:  Not well.  Let us discuss your inheritance.<br> <br>Edmund:  [has sat]  Ah, yes, good.  Erm, a little drink, first?<br> <br>Aunt:  [stands]  Drink?!  [slaps him twice]  Wicked child!!!  Drink is<br>       urine for the last leper in Hell!<br> <br>Edmund:  Oh, no, no -- this is only water.  This is a house of simple purity.<br> <br>	[Monk enters, breasts and all, in convulsions.  He rushes to the<br>	 fireplace and vomits, then turns and begins to leave.]<br> <br>Monk:  Great booze-up, Edmund!  [farts, leaves]<br> <br>	[pause]<br> <br>Aunt:  Do you know that man?<br> <br>Edmund:  [looks behind himself as though he didn't really see]  No...<br> <br>Aunt:  He called you `Edmund'...<br> <br>Edmund:  Oh, >know< >him<...oh, yes, I do.<br> <br>Aunt:  Then can you explain what he meant by `great booze-up'?<br> <br>Edmund:  [thinks ... ... ... thinks ... ... ... thinks ... ... ... thinks<br>	  ... ... ... thinks ... ... ... thinks ... ... ... thinks ... ...<br>	   ... thinks ... ... ... thinks ... ... ... thinks ... ... ... thinks]<br>	 <br>	 Yes, I can...

He's been suffering from<br>	 sleeping sickness...and he has obviously just woken...because, as<br>	 you heard, "Great Bu's up"...<br> <br>Percy:  [almost passing out from holding his breath]  Well done, Edmund...<br> <br>Edmund:  ...and I think I'd better just go and visit him...  [stands]<br>	 Perce, over to you...  [leaves]<br> <br>Percy:  Yes...  How about some sort of game?  Er, how about a couple of<br>	frames of Shove-Piggy-Shove?  [he gets frightened at Aunt's reaction,<br>	which is not seen on camera]<br> <br>	[Edmund re-enters Baldrick's bedroom.  Piddle has a cardinal's<br>	 hat in his hand (for the aformentioned Cardinal Chunder routine).]<br> <br>Melchett:  [climbing off the floor]  Blackadder! You challenged me to a<br>	   drinking competition earlier today, and I haven't seen you touch<br>	   a drop!<br> <br>Edmund:  Nonsense!<br> <br>Melchett:  It's true!  You, you twist and turn like a...twisty turny thing.<br>	   I say you're a weedy pigeon, and you can call me `Susan' if it<br>	   isn't so.<br> <br>Edmund:  Fine, all right.  [opens the door, calls out]  Baldrick, fetch my<br>	 Incredibly Strong Ale...!<br> <br>Monk:  Good god!  Not Dr McGloo's Amber Enema...?<br> <br>Edmund:  Pah! -- a drink for schoolgirls...<br> <br>Partridge:  Surely not Strollop's Lobster Scrumpy...?<br> <br>Edmund:  No -- it is Blackadder's Bowel Basher!<br> <br>	[Baldrick enters with a pitcher and glass.]<br> <br>Edmund:  ...a brew guaranteed to knock the backside off a concrete elephant!<br>	 ...is it not, Baldrick?<br> <br>Baldrick:  Nah, it's water.<br> <br>Melchett:  WHAT?<br> <br>	[Partridge growls]<br> <br>Edmund:  Eh, heh heh... No, but seriously, Baldrick -- and presuming you wish<br>	 to see another dawn...<br> <br>Baldrick:  You did call for your Incredibly Strong Ale, My Lord...?<br> <br>Edmund:  [trying to show off]  Yes, that's right.<br> <br>Baldrick:  Oh, that's a relief; I thought I'd made a mistake.<br> <br>Edmund:  Ah.<br> <br>	[Baldrick begins to pour the water in the glass.  Being a glass and<br>	 not a metal mug like all the others have, everyone can see that the<br>	 liquid is water -- particularly when Baldrick spills some.]<br> <br>Piddle:  [standing, shouts]  My god! He's right!  It >is< water!<br> <br>	[Edmund kicks Baldrick in the shin.]<br> <br>Monk:  Come on, lads -- let's give him a >real< drink!  [he gives a pitcher<br>       to Edmund]<br> <br>Edmund:  Well, fine...<br> <br>Monk:  Bums up!<br> <br>Partridge:  Way-hey! `Bums'!  Sounds a bit like `bum', doesn't it?<br> <br>Melchett:  Drink, Blackadder!  Drink!<br> <br>	[Edmund begins to drink...]<br> <br>	[42 Seconds Later]<br> <br>	[In the main room, Percy is hit by Aunt.  Edmund enters, with the<br>	 cardinal hat on his head and the ostrich feather sticking out of<br>	 the back of his tights.  His speech is slurred.]<br> <br>Edmund:  Percy, I've lost the bet.<br> <br>Aunt:  Edmund! Explain yourself!<br> <br>Edmund:  I can't -- not just like that.  I'm a complicated person, you see,<br>	 Aunty...  Sometimes I'm nice, and sometimes I'm nasty -- hee hee!<br>	 ...and sometimes I just like to sing little songs, like:<br>	 "See the little goblin, see his little--<br> <br>Aunt:  I mean explain why you are wearing a cardinal's hat, why you are<br>       grinning inanely, and [sees the feather as Edmund turns around and<br>       falls to his knees, leaning against the chair to the side of the<br>       door] ...why you have an ostrich feather sticking out of your<br>       britches!<br> <br>Edmund:  I'm wearing a cardinal's hat because I'm Cardinal Chunder;<br>	 I have an ostrich feather up my bottom [Percy nods and mouths<br>	 Edmund's words, having heard this before] because Mr Ostrich put it<br>	 there to keep in the little pixies -- hah hah! -- and I'm grinning<br>	 inanely because I think I've just about succeeded in conning you<br>	 and your daft husband out of a whopping great inheritance -- hee hee<br>	 hee hee hee!<br> <br>Aunt:  [shouting]  Is that right?  May I remind you, cursed creature [raises<br>       her hand to slap him, but he's too far away, so slaps Percy instead],<br>       that your inheritance depends upon your not drinking and not gambling.<br> <br>Edmund:  Oh, yes -- damn.  Percy, the devil farts in my face once more.<br> <br>Aunt:  Not mentioning farts was also a condition.<br> <br>Edmund:  Shove off, you old trout!<br> <br>Aunt:  How dare you speak to my husband like that!  [Uncle is surprised at<br>       this remark]  Nathaniel, we're leaving!<br> <br>	[Uncle stands and walks out.]<br> <br>Aunt:  [turns to Percy]  and you...<br> <br>Percy:  [frightened]  Yes?<br> <br>Aunt:  Has anyone ever told you you're a giggling imbecile?<br> <br>Percy:  [as though it goes without saying]  Oh, yes...<br> <br>Aunt:  Good.  [stands, leaves, slamming the door]<br> <br>Edmund:  Good riddance, you old witch!<br> <br>	[There's a knock on the room door.]<br> <br>Edmund:  Whoops -- she's forgotten her broomstick.<br> <br>	[The door opens, and Uncle leans in.]<br> <br>Uncle:  Look, er... [checks to see that Aunt doesn't hear him]<br>	I just wanted to say thanks for a splendid evening.  Yes, first rate,<br>	all round...

Another stripper!<br> <br>	[Uncle comes out.]<br> <br>Piddle:  ...and a male stripper!<br> <br>	[The boozers cheer.  Uncle goes back into the closet.]<br> <br>Monk:  [removing Queen's cloak]  Oh, yes, this is much more like it!<br> <br>	[There's a pause while they see Queen in her royal dress]<br> <br>Partridge:  ...and she's come dressed as the Queen!<br> <br>Piddle:  Oh!!
