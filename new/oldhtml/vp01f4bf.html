[laughs happily]<br> <br>	[Edmund Blackadder, butler to the Prince Regent, enters]<br> <br>Edmund:  Ah, good morning, Mrs Miggins.<br> <br>Miggins:  Bonjour, monsieur.<br> <br>Edmund:  What?<br> <br>Miggins:  Bonjour, monsieur -- it's French.<br> <br>Edmund:  So is eating frogs, cruelty to geese and urinating in the street,<br>	 but that's no reason to inflict it on the rest of us.<br> <br>Miggins:  But French is all the fashion!  My coffee shop is full of<br>	  frenchies, and it's all because of that wonderful Scarlet<br>	  Pimpernel.  [an odd squishy noise is heard occasionally,<br>		       starting now]<br> <br>Edmund:  The Scarlet Pimpernel is >not< wonderful, Mrs Miggins.  There is<br>	 no reason whatsoever to admire someone for filling London with<br>	 a load of garlic-chewing French toffs crying "Oh la la!" and looking<br>	 for sympathy all the time just because their fathers had their heads<br>	 cut off.<br> <br>	 I'll have a cup of coffee and some shepherd's pie, please.<br> <br>Miggins:  [put off]  We don't serve >pies< anymore!  My French clientele<br>	  consider >pies< uncouth.<br> <br>Edmund:  I hardly think that a nation that eats snails and would go to bed<br>	 with the kitchen sink if it put on a tutu is in any position to<br>	 preach couthness.<br> <br>	 So what >is< on the menu?  [he picks up the small menu and flips it<br>	 over looking at it casually]<br> <br>Miggins:  Well, today's hot choice is Chicken Pimpernel in a Scarlet Sauce,<br>	  Scarlet Chicken in a Pimpernel Sauce, or Huge Suspicious-Looking<br>	  Sausages in a Scarlet Pimpernel Sauce.<br> <br>Edmund:  What exactly is Scarlet Pimpernel sauce?<br> <br>Miggins:  [she uses her hands to demonstrate as she speaks]  You take a large<br>	  ripe frog, squeeze it [one of the squishy noises is heard as she<br>	  makes this motion, giving away what the noise is] --<br> <br>Edmund:  [putting up a hand]  Yes, yes, all right.  [several words are covered<br>	 entirely by laughter (anyone out there have a closed-caption decoder,<br>	 since the commercial-release tapes are closed-captioned?).]<br> <br>	[Edmund goes to the door to leave, just as a Frenchman enters.]<br> <br>Frenchman:  [bowing]  Ah, bonjour, monsieur!<br> <br>Edmund:  Sod off.<br> <br> <br>	[Scene changes to Edmund's quarters, below the prince's house.<br>	 Baldrick is tearing apart some dough.  Edmund enters, picks up<br>	 a tabby cat and punts it high into the air across the room.]<br> <br>Baldrick:  Oh, Sir!  Poor little Mildred the cat!  What's he ever done to you?<br> <br>Edmund:  It is the way of the world, Baldrick -- the abused always kick<br>	 downwards.  I am annoyed, and so I kick the cat... the cat<br>	 [there is a mouse `eek!' noise] pounces on the mouse, and, finally,<br>	 the mouse--<br> <br>Baldrick:  [startled, jumps]  Agh!<br> <br>Edmund:  ...bites you on the behind.<br> <br>Baldrick:  Well, what do I do?<br> <br>Edmund:  Nothing.  You are last in God's great chain, Baldrick -- unless,<br>	 of course, there's an earwig around here that you'd like to<br>	 victimise.<br> <br>	[Baldrick leans toward Edmund, trying to get him to notice something]<br> <br>Edmund:  [notices]  Baldrick, what's happened to your nose?<br> <br>Baldrick:  Nice, isn't it?<br> <br>Edmund:  No it isn't.  It's revolting.<br> <br>Baldrick:  Oh.  I'll take it off, then.  [removes item from his nose]<br> <br>Edmund:  Baldrick, why are you wearing a false boil?  What are we to expect<br>	 next: a beauty wart? a cosmetic verruca?<br> <br>Baldrick:  It's a Scarlet Pimple, Sir.<br> <br>Edmund:  Really...<br> <br>Baldrick:  Yeah, they're all the rage down our way.  Everyone wants to<br>	   express their admiration for the great Pimple and his brilliant<br>	   disguises.<br> <br>Edmund:  [takes the pimple, speaks angrily]  What has this fellow done? --<br>	 apart from pop over to France to grab a few French knobs from the<br>	 ineffectual clutches [tosses pimple into the fireplace] of some <br>	 malnourished whingeing lefties, taking the opportunity while there,<br>	 no doubt, to pick up some really good cheap wine and some of their<br>	 marvelous open-fruit flans...<br> <br>	 Doesn't anyone know?  We hate the French!  We fight wars against<br>	 them!  Did all those men die in vain on the field at Agincourt?<br>	 Was the man who burned Joan of Arc simply wasting good matches?<br> <br>	[Bells ring.]<br> <br>Edmund:  Ah, His Royal Highness, the Pinhead of Wales, summons me.  You know,<br>	 I feel almost well-disposed towards him this morning.  Half the<br>	 chump though he may be, at least he's not French.<br> <br> <br>	[Scene changes to inside Prince's bedroom.  He is having some drinks<br>	 with lords Topper and Smedley.]<br> <br>Prince:  "Un toast! Encore un toast," I say!  Le Pimpernel Scarlette!<br> <br>Topper & Smedley:  Le Pimpernel Scarlette!<br> <br>	[Edmund enters.]<br> <br>Prince:  Ah!  Le Adder Noir!  Come on au in!<br> <br>	[Edmund is upset, but restrains it.]<br> <br>Prince:  [to Topper and Smedley]  This is the fellow to ask, you chaps:<br>	 my butler -- terribly clever.  Brighter than a brain pie.<br>	 [Topper and Smedley chuckle like the dandies they are]<br> <br>	 Blackadder, we're trying to guess who the Scarlet Pimpernel is,<br>	 so we can send him an enormous postal order to express our<br>	 admiration.  Any ideas?<br> <br>Edmund:  Well, I'm sure if you addressed the envelope to "The Biggest Show-Off<br>	 in London," it would reach him eventually.  <br> <br>	[Topper and Smedley stand up from where they were lying (on Prince's<br>	 bed) and approach Edmund.]<br> <br>Topper:  Tish and pish! Gadzooks! Milarky!  How dare you say such a thing?<br>	 Damn me, sir, if you're not the worst kind of swine!<br> <br>Smedley:  Damn that swine...<br> <br>Edmund:  I'm sorry, Sir.  I was merely pointing out that sneaking aristocrats<br>	 out from under the noses of French revolutionaries is about as<br>	 difficult as putting on a hat.<br> <br>Topper:  Sink me, sir!  This is treason!  The Scarlet Pimpernel's a hero,<br>	 and the revolution is orchestrated by a ruthless band of highly<br>	 organised killers, damn them!<br> <br>Smedley:  Damn those organised killers...<br> <br>Topper:  [turning to Prince]  Sir, if I remember rightly, we were just<br>	 discussing the French Embassy ball in honour of the exiled<br>	 aristocracy...<br> <br>Prince:  We certainly were -- where I intend the wear the most magnificent<br>	 pair of trousers ever to issue forth from the delicate hands of<br>	 Mssrs Snibcock and Turkey, Couturiers to the Very Wealthy and the<br>	 Extremely Fat.  If the Pimpernel does finally reveal himself, I<br>	 don't want to get caught out wearing boring trousers!<br> <br>Smedley:  Damn those boring trousers...<br> <br>Topper:  Well, what say we bet your cock-sure domestic a thousand guineas <br>	 he can't go to France, rescue an aristocrat, and present him at<br>	 the ball?<br> <br>	[Edmund looks up.]<br> <br>Topper:  Hah!  That's turned you white, hasn't it?  That's frightened you,<br>	 you lily-livered, caramel-kidneyed, custard-coloured cad?<br>	 Not so brilliant now, are you, eh? eh?<br> <br>Smedley:  Eh?<br> <br>Edmund:  On the contrary, Sir.  I'll just go and pack.<br> <br>Topper:  Oh.<br> <br>Edmund:  Perhaps Lord Smedley and Lord Topper will accompany me.  I'm sure<br>	 it will be a fairly easy trip -- the odd death-defying leap and a<br>	 modest amount of dental torture...  Want to come?<br> <br>Topper:  [frightened]  Oh, no!<br> <br>Smedley:  Oh, no...<br> <br>Topper:  Damn!<br> <br>Smedley:  Damn...<br> <br>Topper:  Er, any day now, I've got an appointment at my doctor.	 I've got<br>	 a bit of a sniffle coming on -- I can feel it in my bones.<br> <br>Smedley:  Damn bones, damn bones, damn...<br> <br>Prince:  You know, what about next week?  Oh, come on, you chaps, get your<br>	 diaries out, come on!<br> <br>Topper:  Oh, all right.  Damn!<br> <br>Smedley:  Damn...<br> <br>Topper:  I left it behind!<br> <br>Smedley:  ...behind...<br> <br>Topper:  ...and, er, besides, I've just remembered: my father's just died!<br> <br>	[Smedley can't say the same thing this time; looks confused.]<br> <br>Topper:  I've got to be at his funeral in ten minutes!  Damn sorry!<br>	 Goodbye, Your Highness.  [He bows, giving his drink to Edmund.<br>	 Edmund opens the door and lets him out.]<br> <br>Smedley:  Oh, damn...  I'm the best man.  Damn that dead father, damn...<br>	  [Gives his drink to Edmund; bows; exits, saying "Bye bye..."]<br> <br>Edmund:  [beyond the door to the exiting pair]  See you at the ball.<br> <br>Prince:  Oh, what a shame they were so busy.  [walking into the chamber]<br>	 It would have been lovely to have had them with us.<br> <br>Edmund:  "Us"?<br> <br>Prince:  Yes.<br> <br>Edmund:  >You're< coming, Sir?<br> <br>Prince:  Well, certainly.<br> <br>Edmund:  Ah.  [pause]  and nothing I can say about the mind-bending horrors<br>	 of the revolution could put you off?<br> <br>Prince:  Absolutely not!  Now, come on, Blackadder -- let's get packing.<br>	 I want to look my best for those fabulous French birds.<br> <br>Edmund:  Sir, the type of women currently favoured in France are toothless<br>	 crones who just cackle insanely.<br> <br>Prince:  Oh, ignore that -- they're just playing hard-to-get.<br> <br>Edmund:  ...by removing all their teeth, going mad and aging forty years?<br> <br>Prince:  That's right -- the little teasers!  Well, come on!  [he reclines]<br>	 Erm, I think a blend of silks and satins...<br> <br>Edmund:  I fear not, Sir.  If we are to stand any chance of survival in<br>	 France, [he rings the servant bell] we shall have to dress as the<br>	 smelliest lowlife imaginable.<br> <br>Prince:  Oh yes?  What sort of thing?<br> <br>Edmund:  Well, Sir, let me show you our Paris Collection...<br> <br>	[Baldrick begins walking in from the the outer door.]<br> <br>Edmund:  Baldrick is wearing a sheep's-bladder jacket, with matching<br>	 dung-ball accessories.  Hair by Crazy Meg of Bedlam [obscured<br>	 by laughter].  Notice how the overpowering aroma of rotting<br>	 pilchards has been woven cunningly into the ensemble.<br> <br>	[Edmund approaches Baldrick.]<br> <br>Edmund:  Baldrick, when did you last change your trousers?<br> <br>Baldrick:  [as if rehearsed]  I have never changed my trousers.<br> <br>Edmund:  Thank you.  [to Prince]  You see, the ancient Greeks, Sir, wrote<br>	 in legend of a terrible container in which all the evils of the<br>	 world were trapped.  How prophetic they were.  All they got wrong<br>	 was the name.  They called it "Pandora's Box," when, of course,<br>	 they meant "Baldrick's Trousers."<br> <br>Baldrick:  [to Prince]  It certainly can get a bit whiffy, there's no doubt<br>			about that!<br> <br>Edmund:  We are told that, when the box was opened, the whole world turned<br>	 to darkness because of Pandora's fatal curiousity.  [to Baldrick]<br>	 I charge you now, Baldrick: for the good of all mankind, never<br>	 allow curiosity to lead you to open your trousers.  Nothing of<br>	 interest lies therein.<br> <br>	 [to Prince]  However, Your Highness, it is trousers exactly like<br>	 these that >you< will have to wear if we are to pass safely into<br>	 France.<br> <br>Prince:  Mmm, ahem, yes, well, you know, er, on second thought, I think I<br>	 might give this whole thing a miss.  You know, my tummy's playing<br>	 up a bit.  Er, wish... wish I could come, but just not poss with<br>	 this tum.<br> <br>Edmund:  I understand perfectly, Sir.<br> <br>Prince:  Also, the chances of me scoring if I look and smell like him<br>	 are >zero<.<br> <br>Edmund:  Well, that's true, Sir.  We shall return presently to bid you<br>	 farewell.<br> <br>	[Prince turns to enter his bedroom; Edmund and Baldrick head out.]<br> <br>Baldrick:  Mr B, I've been having second thoughts about this trip to France.<br> <br>Edmund:  Oh?  Why?<br> <br>Baldrick:  Well, as far as I can see, looking and smelling like this,<br>	   there's not much chance of >me< scoring, either.<br> <br>	[Edmund thwaps him on the head.]<br> <br> <br>	[Scene changes to Prince, Edmund and Baldrick (who is carrying<br>	 everything) standing in the vestibule.  This scene is overplayed,<br>	 complete with `farewell' harp music.]<br> <br>Prince:  Well, Blackadder, this is it.<br> <br>Edmund:  Yes, Sir.  If I don't make it back, please write to my mother<br>	 and tell her that I've been alive all the time; it's just that<br>	 I couldn't be bothered to get in touch with the old bat.<br> <br>Prince:  Well, of course, old man.  It's the very least I could do.<br> <br>Edmund:  We must leave at once.  The shadows lengthen, and we have a long<br>	 and arduous journey ahead of us.  [He shakes Prince's hand.]<br>	 Farewell, dear master and -- dare I say? -- friend.<br> <br>	[Edmund and Prince embrace.  Prince speaks as they separate.]<br> <br>Prince:  Farewell, brave liberator and -- dare I say it? -- butler!<br> <br>	[Edmund and Baldrick leave.  Prince starts to cry.]<br> <br> <br>	[Scene changes to Edmund's quarters.  Edmund and Baldrick enter.]<br> <br>Edmund:  Right, stick the kettle on, Balders.<br> <br>Baldrick:  What, aren't we going to France?<br> <br>Edmund:  Of course we're not going to France -- it's incredibly dangerous<br>	 there!<br> <br>Baldrick:  Well, how are you going to win your bet?<br> <br>Edmund:  As usual, Baldrick: by the use of the large thing between my ears.<br> <br>Baldrick:  Oh, your nose...<br> <br>Edmund:  No, Baldrick: my brain.  All we do is lie low here for a week, then<br>	 go to Mrs Miggins', pick up any old French aristocrat, drag him<br>	 through a puddle, take him to the ball, and claim our thousand<br>	 guineas.<br> <br>Baldrick:  Well, what if the prince finds us here?<br> <br>Edmund:  He couldn't find his own fly buttons, let alone the kitchen door.<br> <br> <br>	[Scene changes to Prince's bedroom.  Prince takes a pair of blue<br>	 trousers with silver dots and silver side stripes from a box.]<br> <br>Prince:  What a pair of trousers!!!  I shall be the Belle of the Embassy<br>	 Ball!  Now, how do you put them on?  Er...  [calls] Blackadder!<br>	 [realisation] Oh, no -- damn! -- he's gone to France.  Well, I'll<br>	 do it myself; shouldn't be too difficult.  Erm... Er...<br>	 [he puts an arm through one trouser leg...]<br> <br> <br>	[One Week Later]<br> <br>	[Scene: Edmund's quarters.]<br> <br>Edmund:  [sitting in a chair, his feet on the table, smoking a pipe]<br>	 Well, Baldrick, what a very pleasant week.  We must do this more<br>	 often.<br> <br>Baldrick:  [seeming a bit bored]  Yes, I shall certainly choose revolutionary<br>	   France for my holiday again next year.<br> <br>Edmund:  Still, time to go to work.  Off to Mrs Miggins' to pick up any old<br>	 French toff--<br> <br>	[A crashing noise upstairs interrupts him.]<br> <br>Baldrick:  What do you think that is?<br> <br>Edmund:  Well, if I was feeling malicious, I would say it's the prince<br>	 still trying to put his trousers on after a week.<br> <br> <br>	[Scene change to upstairs.]<br> <br>	[Prince, wearing his trousers over his head, is bumping into walls.]<br> <br>Prince:  Damn!<br> <br> <br>	[Scene change to Mrs Miggins' coffee shop.]<br> <br>	[Edmund and Baldrick enter.]<br> <br>Edmund:  Ah, Mrs Miggins...  I'd like a massive plate of pig's trotters,<br>	 frog's legs and snail's ears, please -- all drenched in your lovely<br>	 Scarlet Pimpernel Sauce.<br> <br>Miggins:  Not so hostile to the frenchies >now<, Mr B...<br> <br>Edmund:  Certainly not, Mrs M.  I'd sooner be hostile to my own servant.<br>	 [baps Baldrick on the back of the head]<br>	 [Several words obscured by laughter.]<br> <br>	 In fact, I came here specifically to meet lovely frenchies.<br> <br>Miggins:  Well, vivre to that and an eclair for both of us!  [laughs]<br> <br>Edmund:  Vivre, indeed.  Now, what I'm looking for, Mrs M, is a particular<br>	 kind of frenchy -- namely, one who is transparently of noble blood<br>	 but also short on cash.<br> <br>Miggins:  Ah, well, I've got just the fellow for you -- over there by the<br>	  window: The Comte de Frou Frou.<br> <br>	[Shot of Frou Frou holding -- and looking oddly at -- a huge<br>	 suspicious-looking sausage.]<br> <br>Miggins:  He's pretty down on his luck, and he's made that horse's willy<br>	  last all morning.<br> <br>Edmund:  Oh, good.  Baldrick, we have struck garlic!<br> <br>	[Edmund and Baldrick approach Frou Frou.  Edmund scrapes leftovers<br>	 off of Frou Frou's table onto a plate, then offers the plate to<br>	 Baldrick.]<br> <br>Edmund:  Now you can some lunch, Baldrick.<br> <br>Baldrick:  Thank you.  [leaves the coffee shop]<br> <br>Edmund:  [addresses Frou Frou]  Le Comte de Frou Frou, I believe...<br> <br>Frou Frou:  [looks up]  Eh?<br> <br>Edmund:  [sitting at the table]  Do you speak English?<br> <br>Frou Frou:  A little...<br> <br>Edmund:  Yes, when you say "a little," what exactly do you mean?  I mean,<br>	 can we talk? or are we going to spend the rest of the afternoon<br>	 asking each other the way to the beach in very loud voices?<br> <br>Frou Frou:  Ah, no.  I can, er, order coffee, deal with waiters, make sexy<br>	    chit-chat with girls -- that type of thing.<br> <br>Edmund:  Oh, good.<br> <br>Frou Frou:  Just don't ask me to take a physiology class or direct a light<br>	    opera.<br> <br>Edmund:  No, no, I won't.  [propositioning]  Now, listen, Frou Frou ...<br>	 Would you like to earn some money?<br> <br>Frou Frou:  No, I wouldn't.  I would like other people to earn it and then<br>	    >give< it to me, just like in France in the good old days.<br> <br>Edmund:  Yes, but this is a chance to return to the good old days.<br> <br>Frou Frou:  Oh, how I would love that!  I hate this life!  The food is<br>	    filthy!  This huge sausage is very suspicious.  If I didn't know<br>	    better, I'd say it was a horse's wi--<br> <br>Edmund:  Yes, yes, yes, all right...  Now, listen; the plan is this:<br>	 I have a bet on with someone that I can get a Frenchman out<br>	 of Paris.  I want >you< to be that Frenchman.  All you have to<br>	 do is come to the embassy with me, say that I rescued you, and<br>	 then walk away with fifty guineas and all the vol-au-vents<br>	 you can stuff in your pockets.  What do you say?<br> <br>Frou Frou:  It will be a pleasure!  If there's one thing we aristocrats<br>	    enjoy, it's a fabulous partie!  Oh, the music! Oh, the laughter!<br>	    Oh -- if only I'd brought my mongoose costume...<br> <br> <br>	[Scene change to the embassy.  It is dank, and some moans of despair<br>	 can be heard.  Edmund, Frou Frou and Baldrick enter.]<br> <br>Frou Frou:  Yes, well, obviously it hasn't really got going yet...<br> <br>Edmund:  I think that is a bit of an understatement, Frou Frou.  I've been<br>	 at autopsies with more party atmosphere.<br> <br>Frou Frou:  Don't worry!  In a moment we will hear the sound of music and<br>	    happy laughter...<br> <br>	[Laughter is heard -- evil maniacal laughter.  A French soldier<br>	 approaches.]<br> <br>Soldier:  [to Frou Frou]  Bon soir, monsieur.<br> <br>Frou Frou:  Bon soir!<br> <br>Edmund:  Ah, good evening, my man.  Do you speak English?<br> <br>Soldier:  Little.<br> <br>Edmund:  Good, well, just take me to the ambassador, then, will you?<br> <br>Soldier:  Pardon?<br> <br>Edmund:  [articulate]  I have rescued an [pushes the end of his nose up]<br>	 aristocrat, from [makes claw-like hands] the clutches of the<br>	 evil revolutionaries.  Please take me to the ambassador.<br> <br>Soldier:  No, I won't.  I >am< an [makes claw hands] "evil revolutionarie,"<br>	  and have [slices finger across his neck] murdered the [pushes up<br>	  his nose] ambassadeur, and turned him into [slaps the back and<br>	  front of one hand against the other, then puts that same hand to<br>	  his mouth] pate!<br> <br>Edmund:  Ah.<br> <br>Soldier:  [to Frou Frou]  ...and you, aristo-pig, are trapped!!!<br> <br>Frou Frou:  Peeg? Hah!  You will regret your insolence, revolutionary deug!<br> <br>Solider:  Dog? Hah!  You will regret your arrogance, royalist snake!<br> <br>Frou Frou:  Sneag? Hah!<br> <br>Edmund:  [stepping in]  Look, I've very sorry to interrupt this very<br>	 interesting discussion, but it really is none of my business,<br>	 so I think I'll be on my way.  Come on, Baldrick.<br> <br>Soldier:  [stopping Edmund]  Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah!  Not so fast, English!<br>	  In rescuing this, eu [motions at Frou Frou], this, eu, boite de<br>	  stinkyweed, you have attempted to pervert revolutionary justice.<br>	  Do you know what they do to people who do that?<br> <br>Edmund:  They're...given a little present and allowed to go free?<br> <br>Soldier:  No...<br> <br>Edmund:  They're smacked and told not to be naughty, but basically let off...<br> <br>Soldier:  No...<br> <br>Baldrick:  [raising his hand]  I think I know.<br> <br>Edmund:  [quite unhappy and depressed]  What?<br> <br>Baldrick:  [quite happy that he knows the answer]  They're put in prison for<br>	   the night, and brutally guillotined in the morning!<br> <br>Edmund:  Well done, Baldrick...<br> <br>Soldier:  Your little g'nome is correct, monsieur.  Gentlemen! Welcome<br>	  to the last day of your life!  [shuts and locks the door]<br> <br> <br>	[Scene change to our heroes in a cell, with Soldier outside.]<br> <br>Frou Frou:  How dare you, you filthy weaselle!<br> <br>Solider:  Weasel? Hah!  You're one to talk, aristo-waat-heug!<br> <br>Frou Four:  Warthog? Hah!<br> <br>Soldier:  Hah!<br> <br>Edmund:  [pulling Frou Frou away from the barred window]  Excuse me,<br>	 Frou Frou...  [to Soldier]  Look, mate, me old mate...<br>	 We're both working class; we both hate these rich bastards;<br>	 I mean, come on, come on, me old mucker, just, just let<br>	 me go -- you've got nothing against me...<br> <br>Soldier:  On the contrarie!  I >hate< you English with your boring trousers<br>	  and your shiny toilet paper, and your ridiculous preconception that<br>	  Frenchmen are great lovers -- [looks both ways, then speaks a bit<br>	  softly] >I'm< French, and I'm hung like a baby carrot and a couple<br>	  of petit-pois.<br> <br>Edmund:  [obscured by laughter]<br> <br>Soldier:  Farewell, "old muckeur," and [shouts] death to the aristoes!!!<br> <br>Baldrick:  [joining in happily]  Death to the aristoes!<br> <br>Edmund:  Oh, shut up, Mouse-brain...<br> <br>	[Now inside the cell.  Baldrick sits on the bed.]<br> <br>Frou Frou:  Monsieur, why do you waste your words on this scum?<br>	    Have no fear!  The Scarlet Pimpernel will save us.<br> <br>Edmund:  Hah!  [knocks Baldrick off the bed; Baldrick falls to the floor, and<br>	 remains sitting where he lands]  Some hope.  [lies down]<br>	 The Scarlet Pimpernel is the most overrated human being since<br>	 Judas Iscariot won the A.D. 31 Best Disciple Competition.<br> <br>Frou Frou:  Well, if he >should< fail us, here: I these have these suicide<br>	    pills.  One for me [pulls pill out of his ear]; one for you<br>	    [pulls one out of a nostril]; and one for the dwarf [pulls one<br>	    out of his bottom -- various silly noises accompany each].<br> <br>Edmund:  Say "thank you," Baldrick.<br> <br>Baldrick:  Thank you, Mr Frou.  [puts pill to his mouth; Edmund stops him.]<br> <br>	[The door begins to open.]<br> <br>Frou Frou:  Ah, the Pimpernel!!<br> <br>Baldrick:  Hurray!<br> <br>Soldier:  [entering]  Ah, the >ambassador<, hurray...<br>	  [moves his fingers about, bounces on his toes]<br>	  Hmm, I've got nothing to do...  So I think I will torture ...<br>	  [points to Frou Frou, forces him to stand, and shouts]<br>	  you, aristo-mongreulle!<br> <br>Frou Frou:  Mongrel? Hah!  I look forward to it, proletarian skeunk!<br> <br>Soldier:  Skunk? Hah!  We'll see about that, aristocratic happypotamus!<br> <br>Frou Frou:  [being led outside]  Happypotamus? Hah!  We'll soon see who's<br>	    the happypotamus ... [voice gets quiet as door is shut and<br>	    locked (I think the rest of his vocalisations are nonsense<br>	    anyway)]<br> <br>Baldrick:  I'm glad to say, I don't think you'll be needing those pills,<br>	   Mr B...<br> <br>Edmund:  I'm I jumping the gun, Baldrick, or are the words "I have a cunning<br>	 plan" marching with ill-deserved confidence in the direction of<br>	 this conversation?<br> <br>Baldrick:  They certainly are!<br> <br>Edmund:  Well, forgive me if I don't jump up and down with glee; your<br>	 record in this department is not exactly a hundred percent.<br>	 So, what's the plan?<br> <br>Baldrick:  We do...nothing.<br> <br>Edmund:  Yep, that's another world-beater.<br> <br>Baldrick:  Wait, I haven't finished.  We do nothing until our heads have<br>	   actually been cut off...<br> <br>Edmund:  ...and then we spring into action?<br> <br>Baldrick:  Exactly!  You know how, when you cut a chicken's head off, it<br>	   runs round and round the farmyard?<br> <br>Edmund:  Yyyyyyyeah...<br> <br>Baldrick:  Well, we wait until our heads have been cut off, then we run<br>	   round and round the farmyard, out the farm gate, and escape.<br>	   What do you think?<br> <br>Edmund:  Yes... My opinions are rather difficult to express in words,<br>	 so perhaps I can put it this way...  [tweaks Baldrick's nose]<br> <br>Baldrick:  It doesn't really matter, 'cause the Scarlet Pimpernel will save<br>	   us, anyway.<br> <br>Edmund:  No he won't, Baldrick.  Either I think up an idea, or, tomorrow,<br>	 we die -- which, Baldrick, I have to tell you, I have no intention<br>	 of doing, because I want to be young and wild, and then I want to be<br>	 middle-aged and rich, and then I want to be old and annoy people by<br>	 pretending that I'm deaf.  Just be quiet and let me think.<br> <br> <br>	[Later that night, in the cell.]<br> <br>Baldrick:  I can't sleep, Mr Blackadder...<br> <br>Edmund:  I said "Shut up"!<br> <br>Baldrick:  I'm so excited to think that the Scarlet Pimpernel will<br>	   be here at any moment!<br> <br>Edmund:  I wish you'd forget this ridiculous fantasy, Baldrick.<br>	 Even if he did turn up, the guards would be woken by the<br>	 scraping noise as he tried to squeeze his massive swollen head<br>	 through the door.<br> <br>Baldrick:  I couldn't sleep when I was little.<br> <br>Edmund:  You still are little, Baldrick.<br> <br>Baldrick:  Yeah, well, when I was even littler, see, we used to live in<br>	   this haunted hovel.  Every night, my family were troubled by<br>	   a visitation from this disgusting ghoul.  It was terrible.<br>	   First there was this unholy smell, then this tiny, clammy,<br>	   hairy creature would materialise in the bed between them.<br>	   Fortunately, I could never see it, myself.<br> <br>Edmund:  Yes... Tell me, Baldrick: when you left home, did this repulsive<br>	 entity mysteriously disappear?<br> <br>Baldrick:  That very day...<br> <br>Edmund:  I think then that the mystery is solved.  Now shut up.  Either<br>	 I think up an idea, or, tomorrow, we meet our maker -- in my case,<br>	 God; in your case, God knows ... but I'd be surprised if he won<br>	 any design awards.<br> <br>	[camera view pans away from them, to the window]<br> <br>Edmund:  Wait a minute!  I thought of a plan!<br> <br>Baldrick:  Hurray!<br> <br>Edmund:  Also, I thought of a way to get you to sleep!<br> <br>Baldrick:  What?<br> <br>	[THUNK!]<br> <br>Baldrick:  Oof!<br> <br> <br>	[Morning, in the cell.  The door opens, and Soldier enters.]<br> <br>Soldier:  Morning, scum...  Did we sleep well, eh?<br> <br>Edmund:  Like a tot, thank you...  But, by jiminy, you must be feeling<br>	 thirsty after your long night's brutality!  [He drops a suicide<br>	 pill into a cup of liquid, then proffers the cup.]  Drink?<br> <br>Soldier:  Eu, non, merci... Not while I am on duty.<br> <br>Edmund:  Oh.  Perhaps later.<br> <br>Soldier:  For you, monsieur, there is no later.  [gets dramatic]  Because,<br>	  gentlemen, I am proud to introduce France's most [puts a hand on<br>	  his abdomen] vicious woman.  Unexpectedly arrived from Paris<br>	  this morning, would you please welcome Madame Guillotine herself!<br>	  [bows aside, with an arm outstretched]<br> <br>Guillotine:  [enters, cackling, carrying a club with spikes, appears to have<br>	      blood on her arms; her face is obscured by her bonnet, and<br>	      she appears to be missing a front tooth]<br>	     Are these the English pigs?<br> <br>Edmund:  Yes, that's us.<br> <br>Guillotine:  Leave them with me, Monsieur Ambassadeur.  I intend to torture<br>	     them in a manner so unbearably gruesome, even you will not be<br>	     able to stand it!<br> <br>Soldier:  I don't think I will have a problem, madame.<br> <br>Guillotine:  No, you will be sick.<br> <br>Soldier:  What if I stay for the first few minutes, and then I leave if<br>	  I'm feeling queasy?<br> <br>Guillotine:  No, you will be sick immediately.<br> <br>Solider:  What if I am sick quietly in a bag?  I mean, what is in your mind?<br> <br>	[Guillotine whispers in Soldier's ear.]<br> <br>	[Soldier goes into convulsions, and removes his hat as he leaves,<br>	 vomiting into it.]<br> <br>Guillotine:  [turns to Edmund]  So! Scum!  Prepare to be in pain!<br> <br>Edmund:  Yes, certainly.  But first, perhaps, a toast: to your beauty!<br>	 [gives Guillotine the poisoned cup]<br> <br>Guillotine:  [tosses club aside]  Oh, thank you.  OK.<br>	     [drinks from cup]<br> <br>Edmund:  Cheers.<br> <br>Guillotine:  So, I expect you were expecting to be rescued, huh?!<br> <br>Edmund:  Hah -- some bloody hope.<br> <br>Guillotine:  [voice suddenly a male voice]<br>	     On the contrary! I'm just sorry I'm so late!<br> <br>Edmund:  What!<br> <br>	[Guillotine removes her bonnet, revealing herself to be Lord Smedley]<br> <br>Smedley:  Yes, gentlemen, I have come to take you to freedom!<br> <br>Baldrick:  Hurray!<br> <br>Edmund:  My god!  Smedley!  But I thought you were an absolute [facit?]!<br> <br>Smedley:  No -- just a damn fine actor!  Thank god I got here before you<br>	  took any of those awful suicide pills!<br> <br>Edmund:  [looks down at the cups]  Errrrrr, yes...  I suppose if someone<br>	 had taken one and wished that he'd hadn't, he'd be able to do<br>	 something about it...<br> <br>Smedley:  No, no -- they're very odd things, you see.  The symptoms are<br>	  most peculiar.  First of all, the victims become very very<br>	  depressed.  [sits on the bed, face in his hands]  Oh, god!  [near<br>	  to tears]  This whole revolution is so depressing, I mean,<br>	  sometimes I wonder why I bother...  I mean, I'm so lonely, and<br>	  nobody loves me...<br> <br>Edmund:  ...and after the depression comes death.<br> <br>Smedley:  No -- after the depression comes [jumps off the bed and grabs<br>	  Edmund's lapels, shouting] the loss of temper, you stuck-up<br>	  bastard!!!  [turns to Baldrick]  What you are staring at???<br>	  [punches Baldrick]<br> <br>Edmund:  ...and after the >temper< comes death.<br> <br>Smedley:  No! After the temper comes the, er... comes the, er...<br> <br>Edmund:  ...forgetfulness?<br> <br>Smedley:  Er, yes, that's it... er... comes the, er...<br> <br>Edmund:  ...forgetfulness.<br> <br>Smedley:  Yes, yes.  Right in the middle of a...of a...thingy...<br>	  you completely forget what it was you...oh, nice pair of shoes!<br> <br>Edmund:  ...and after the forgetfulness, you die.<br> <br>Smedley:  Oh, no! I forgot one!  After the forgetfulness comes a moment of<br>	  exquisite happiness!  [laughs, jumps up and down, waving his arms<br>	  in the air]  Jumping up and down, and waving your arms in the air,<br>	  and knowing that in a minute we're all going to be free! free!!<br>	  free!!!<br> <br>Edmund:  [getting tired of this]  ...and >then< death?<br> <br>Smedley:  No -- you jump into a corner first.<br>	  [jumps into a corner; dies]<br> <br>Baldrick:  Hurray!  It's the Scarlet Pimpernel!<br> <br>Edmund:  Yes, Baldrick...<br> <br>Baldrick:  ...and you killed him!<br> <br>Edmund:  Yes, Baldrick...  I mean, what's the bloody point of being the<br>	 Scarlet Pimpernel if you're going to fall for the old poisoned-cup<br>	 routine?  Scarlet Pimpernel, my foot!  Scarlet Git, more like it!<br>	 [sees that the door is still ajar]  But wait!  Here's our chance<br>	 to escape!  Come on, quick!<br> <br>Baldrick:  But what about Mr Frou?<br> <br>Edmund:  Oh, forget Frou Frou.  I wouldn't pick my nose to save his life.<br>	 Now, come on.  [begins to exit, but runs into Frou Frou]<br>	 Ah! Frou Frou, my old friend and comrade, w-what are you doing here?<br> <br>Frou Frou:  I escaped!  What happened here?<br> <br>Edmund:  Oh, er, nothing, nothing...  [closes cell door]<br> <br>Frou Frou:  Oh, I thought for a moment the Scarlet Pimpernel had<br>	    saved you...!<br> <br>	[Edmund chuckles nervously; looks at -- and nudges -- Baldrick.]<br> <br>	[Baldrick very badly fakes a laugh.]<br> <br> <br>	[Scene change to Prince's house.  Prince nearly has his trousers<br>	 on.  Edmund, Frou Frou and Baldrick enter.]<br> <br>Prince:  Ah, chaps!  Good to see you.  Just trying on the new trousers...<br> <br>Edmund:  I return, Sir, as promised, plus one toff French aristocrat fresh<br>	 from the Bastille.<br> <br>Prince:  [as Frou Frou bows]  Ah! Please to meet you, monsieur.  Do sit down.<br> <br>Frou Frou:  Enchante'...  [goes to sit]<br> <br>Prince:  Damn sorry about the revolution and all that caper -- most awfully<br>	 bad luck.  [to Edmund]  So, tell me, Blackadder: how the devil did<br>	 you get him out?<br> <br>Edmund:  Sir, it is an extraordinary tale of courage and heroism which<br>	 I blush from telling by myself, but seeing as there's no one else--<br> <br>Baldrick:  I could try.<br> <br>Edmund:  [baps Baldrick on the back of the head]<br>	 We left England in good weather, but that was a far as our luck<br>	 held.  In the middle of Dover Harbour, we were struck by a tidal<br>	 wave.  I was forced to swim to Boulogne with the unconscious<br>	 Baldrick tucked into my trousers.  Then, we were taken to Paris,<br>	 where I was summarily tried and condemned to death, and then hung by<br>	 the larger of my testicles from the walls of the Bastille.<br>	 It was then that I decided I had had enough.<br> <br>Prince:  Bravo!<br> <br>Edmund:  So, I rescued the count, killed the guards, jumped the moat,<br>	 ran to Versailles -- where I climbed into Mr Robespierre's<br>	 bedroom, leaving him a small tray of milk chocolates and an<br>	 insulting note.  The rest was easy.<br> <br>Prince:  That is an incredible story -- worthy of the Scarlet Pimpernel<br>	 himself!<br> <br>Edmund:  Well, I wouldn't know.<br> <br>Frou Frou:  I, on the other hand, would.  [stands]  Because, you see, Sir<br>	    [removes glasses, wig and false nose, revealing himself to be<br>	    Lord Topper], >I< am the Scarlet Pimpernel.<br> <br>Edmund:  Uh oh...<br> <br>Baldrick:  Hurray!<br> <br>Prince:  [standing]  Good lord!  Topper!<br> <br>Topper:  Yes, Your Highness.<br> <br>Prince:  Well, by gads and by jingo with dumplings, steak and kidneys,<br>	 and a good solid helping of sprouts!  I can't believe it!<br>	 >You're< the fellow who has single-handedly saved all those<br>	 damned frenchies from the chop?<br> <br>Topper:  Not quite single-handedly, Sir.  I operated with the help of my<br>	 friend, Smedley, but he seems to have disappeared for the moment,<br>	 slightly mysteriously.<br> <br>	[Baldrick gets ready to say something.]<br> <br>Edmund:  Shut up, Baldrick.<br> <br>Baldrick:  [line obscured by laughter]<br> <br>Prince:  So... So Blackadder rescued the Scarlet Pimpernel!<br> <br>Topper:  No, Sir, he did not.<br> <br>Prince:  Eh?<br> <br>Topper:  Prepare yourself for a story of dishonour and deceit that will make<br>	 your stomach turn.<br> <br>Prince:  Well, I say!  [to Edmund]  This is interesting, isn't it, Blackadder?<br> <br>	[Edmund nods slowly.]<br> <br>Topper:  Not only that [turning and walking toward Edmund], but I trust it<br>	 will lead to the imprisonment of a man who is a liar, a bounder,<br>	 and a cad.<br> <br>	[Baldrick turns to look, with Topper, at Edmund.]<br> <br>	[Edmund turns to look behind himself.]<br> <br>Prince:  Well, bravo! because we hate liars, bounders and cads, don't we,<br>	 Blackadder?<br> <br>Edmund:  Generally speaking...yes, Sir.  [begins to serve drinks]<br>	 But perhaps before Lord Topper starts to talk, he might like<br>	 a glass of wine.  [he has dropped a suicide pill into Topper's<br>	 glass]  He's looking a little shaken.<br> <br>Topper:  [taking the glass]  Shaken, but not stirred.  [drinks]<br>	 [gives glass back to Edmund, who sniffs it]<br>	 [turns to Prince]<br>	 It all began last week.  I was sitting in Mrs Miggins' coffee shop<br>	 when...oh, god!  [holds head in his hands]  All this treachery is<br>	 so depressing...  [shouts]  I mean, the whole thing just makes you<br>	 incredibly angry!!!  [swings at Baldrick, missing; Baldrick falls<br>	 over anyway; then Topper runs over to Prince]  AND IT JUST MAKES<br>	 YOU WANT TO...oh, that's a nice waistcoat, Your Majesty...<br>	 er...I'm sorry; I've completely forgotten what I was talking about.<br> <br>Edmund:  [grinning]  Erm, a story of dishonour and deceit...<br> <br>Topper:  [smiles]  Oh! That's a great story!  That's great!!<br>	 Oh, that's a WONDERFUL STORY!!!  Let me just jump into<br>	 this corner first.  [jumps into corner; dies]<br> <br>Prince:  [standing]  Roast my raisins!  He's popped it!  I say, Blackadder,<br>	 do you think he really was the Scarlet Pimpernel?<br> <br>Edmund:  Well, judging from the ridiculous ostentatiousness of his death,<br>	 I would say that he was.<br> <br>Prince:  Well, then, that's a damn shame, because I wanted to give him this<br>	 enormous postal order.  [holds it up]<br> <br>Edmund:  Please, Sir, let me finish.  I would say that he was...>n't<.<br>	 [deeply concentrating now]  You see, the Scarlet Pimpernel would<br>	 never ever reveal his identity -- that's his great secret.<br>	 So, what you're actually looking for is someone who has, say,<br>	 just been to France and rescued an aristocrat, but when asked<br>	 "Are you the Scarlet Pimpernel?" he replies, "Absolutely not,"<br>	 Sir.<br> <br>Prince:  But, wait a minute!  Blackadder, >you've< just been to France,<br>	 and you've rescued a French aristocrat...  Oh, Blackadder!<br>	 Are you the Scarlet Pimpernel?<br> <br>Edmund:  Absolutely not, Sir.<br> <br>Baldrick:  Hurray!<br> <br>	[Prince, too excited for words, hands the postal order to Edmund,<br>	 who already has his hand waiting to take it.]<br> <br>	[final theme music, credits roll]<br> <br>				For the<br>		       BENEFIT of SEVERAL VIEWERS<br>			 MR CURTIS & MR ELTON'S<br>			   Much admir'd Comedy<br>			  B L A C K   A D D E R<br>			    T h e   T H I R D<br>				   or<br>		     N O B   a n d   N O B I L I T Y<br>	    was performed with appropriate Scenery Dresses etc.<br>				   by<br>			    EDMUND BLACKADDER<br>			  butler to the Prince,<br>			   Mr. ROWAN ATKINSON<br>		  Baldrick, a dogsbody, Mr. TONY ROBINSON<br>             The Prince Regent, their master, Mr. HUGH LAURIE<br>		   Mrs. Miggins, a coffee shoppekeeper,<br>			Miss.
