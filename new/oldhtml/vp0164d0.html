Mr. Blackadder.<br><br>E:  Leave me alone Baldrick. If I'd wanted to talk to a vegetable I'd<br>    have bought one at the market.<br><br>B:  Well don't you want this message?<br><br>E:  No thank you... God, I'm wasted here. It's no life for a man of<br>    noble blood being servant to a master with the intellect of a jugged<br>    walrus and all the social graces of a potty.<br><br>B:  I'm wasted too. I've been thinking of bettering myself.<br><br>E:  Oh, really? How?<br><br>B:  I applied for the job of village idiot of Kensington.<br><br>E:  Oh. Get anywhere?<br><br>B:  I got down to the last two, but I failed the final interview.<br><br>E:  Oh, what went wrong?<br><br>B:  I turned up. The other bloke was such an idiot he forgot to.<br><br>E:  Yes, well I'm afraid my ambitions stretch slightly further than<br>    professional idiocy in West London. I want to be remembered when I'm<br>    dead. I want books written about me. I want songs sung about me. And<br>    then hundreds of years from now I want episodes from my life to be<br>    played out weekly at half past nine by some great heroic actor of the<br>    age.<br><br>B:  Yeah, and I could be played by some tiny tit in a beard.<br><br>E:  Quite. Now, what's this message?<br><br>B:  I thought you didn't want it?<br><br>E:  Well I may do. It depends what it is.<br><br>B:  So you do want it?<br><br>E:  Well I don't know, do I? It depends what it is.<br><br>B:  Well, I can't tell you unless you want to know, and you said you<br>    didn't want to know, and now I'm so confused I don't know where I live<br>    or what my name is.<br><br>E:  Your name is of no importance and you live in the pipe in the<br>    upstairs water-closet. (looks at note) Oh God! Was the man who gave<br>    you this, by any chance, a red-headed lunatic with a kilt and a<br>    claymore?<br><br>B:  Yeah, and the funny thing was, he looked exactly like you.<br><br>E:  My mad cousin McAdder. The most dangerous man ever to wear a skirt<br>    in Europe.<br><br>B:  Yeah, he come in here playing the bag-pipes, then he made a haggis,<br>    sang Auld Lang Sayne and punched me in the face.<br><br>E:  Why?<br><br>B:  Because I called him a knock-kneed Scottish pillock.<br><br>E:  An unwise action, Baldrick, since Mad McAdder is a homicidal maniac.<br><br>B:  My mother told me to stand up to homicidal maniacs.<br><br>E:  Yes. If this is the same mother who confidently claimed that you<br>    were a tall handsome stallion of a man, I should treat her opinions<br>    with extreme caution.<br><br>B:  I love my mum.<br><br>E:  And I love chops and sauce but I don't seek their advice. I hate it<br>    when McAdder turns up. He's such a frog-eyed, beetle-browed<br>    basket-case.<br><br>B:  (in Blackadder's ear) He's the spitting image of you.<br><br>E:  No he's not. We're about as similar as two completely... dissimilar<br>    things in a pod. What's the old tartan throw-back banging on about<br>    this time? (reads) "Have come South for the rebellion." Oh God!<br>    Surprise, surprise... "Staying with Miggins. The time has come. Best<br>    sword and Scotland. Insurrection... Blood... Large bowl of porridge...<br>    Rightful claim to throne..." He's mad. He's mad. He's madder than Mad<br>    Jack McMad the winner of last year's Mr Madman competition.<br><br>(The Prince's bell rings.)<br><br>E:  Ah! The walrus awakes.<br><br>The Prince's Bedroom<br>--------------------<br><br>PR: Ah Blackadder. Notice anything unusual?<br><br>E:  Yes sir, it's 11:30 in the morning and you're moving about. Is the<br>    bed on fire?<br><br>PR: Well, I wouldn't know, I've been out *all night*. Guess what I've<br>    been doing? Wraaarrhhhh...<br><br>E:  Beagling, sir?<br><br>PR: Better even than that. Sink me Blackadder if I, if I haven't just<br>    had the most wonderful evening of my life.<br><br>E:  Tell me all sir.<br><br>PR: Well as you know when I set out I looked divine. At the party as I<br>    passed all eyes turned.<br><br>E:  And I daresay quite a few stomachs.<br><br>PR: Well that's right. And then these two ravishing beauties came up to<br>    me and whispered in my ear.. that they loved me. (licks his lips)<br><br>E:  And what happened after you woke up?<br><br>PR: Oh, (falls onto bed) this was no dream Blackadder. Five minutes<br>    later I was in a coach flying through the London night bound for the<br>    ladies' home.<br><br>E:  And which home is this? A home for the elderly or a home for the<br>    mentally disadvantaged?<br><br>PR: Oh no no no no no. This was Apseley House. Do you know it?<br><br>E:  Yes sir. It is the seat of the Duke of Wellington. Those ladies I<br>    fancy would be his nieces.<br><br>PR: Ooh, so you fancy them too? Well, I don't blame you. Bravo. I spent<br>    a night of ecstasy with a pair of Wellingtons and I loved it.<br><br>E:  Sir, it may interest you to know that the Iron Duke has always let<br>    it be known that he will kill in cold blood anyone who takes sexual<br>    advantage of any of his relatives.<br><br>PR: Yes, but Big-nose Wellington is in Spain fighting the French, he'll<br>    never know.<br><br>E:  On the contrary sir. Wellington triumphed six months ago.<br><br>PR: I'm dead.<br><br>E:  It would seem so sir.<br><br>PR: I haven't got a prayer, have I Blackadder?<br><br>E:  Against Throat-slasher Wellington? The finest blade His Majesty<br>    commands? Not really no.<br><br>PR: Then I shall flee. How's your French Blackadder?<br><br>E:  Parfait monsieur. But I fear France will be not far enough.<br><br>PR: Well how's your Mongolian?<br><br>E:  Mmm, chang hatang motzo motzo. But I fear Wellington is a close<br>    personal friend of the chief Mongol. They were at Eton together.<br><br>PR: I'm doomed. Doomed as the dodo.<br><br>(There is a knock on the door.)<br><br>PR: Oh my God, he's here, Wellington's here already!<br><br>(Baldrick enters with a letter.)<br><br>PR: Oh, Your Grace, forgive me. I didn't know what I was doing. I was a<br>    mad, mad, sexually over-active fool.<br><br>E:  Sir, it's Baldrick. You're perfectly safe.<br><br>PR: Well, hurrah!<br><br>E:  (reads letter) Ah, until 6 o'clock tonight.<br><br>PR: Hurrooh.<br><br>E:  "From the Supreme Commander, Allied Forces Europe. Sir, Prince or<br>    pauper, when a man soils a Wellington he puts his foot in it. P.S:<br>    This is not a joke. I do not find my name remotely funny, and people<br>    who do end up dead. Close bracket. I challenge you to a duel tonight<br>    at 18 hundred hours in which you will die. Yours with sincere<br>    apologies for your impending violent slaughter, Arthur Wellesey, Duke<br>    of Wellington."<br><br>B:  Sounds a nice polite sort of bloke.<br><br>PR: (cries) Ahh ah ahhh haaa haaawww.<br><br>E:  Oh, don't worry sir, please. Just consider that life is a valley of<br>    woe filled with pain, misery, hunger and despair.<br><br>PR: Well not for me it bloody isn't! As far as I'm concerned life is a<br>    big palace full of food, drink, and comfy sofas.<br><br>B:  May I speak, sir?<br><br>E:  Certainly not Baldrick! The Prince is about to die. The last thing<br>    he wants to do in his final moments is exchange pleasantries with a<br>    certified plum-duff.<br><br>PR: Easy Blackadder, let's hear him out.<br><br>E:  Very well Baldrick. We shall hear you out, then throw you out.<br><br>B:  Well, Your Majesty, I have a cunning plan which could get you out of<br>    this problem.<br><br>E:  Don't listen to him sir. It's a cruel proletarian trick to raise<br>    your hopes. I shall have him shot the moment he's finished clearing<br>    away your breakfast.<br><br>PR: No wait Blackadder. Perhaps this disgusting degraded creature is<br>    some sort of blessing in disguise.<br><br>E:  Well if he is, it's a very good disguise.<br><br>PR: After all, did not our Lord send a lowly earthworm to comfort Moses<br>    in his torment?<br><br>E:  (firmly) No.<br><br>PR: Well, it's the sort of thing he might have done. Well, come on Mr.<br>    Spotty, speak.<br><br>B:  Well, Your Majesty, I just thought - this Welliton bloke's been in<br>    Europe for years. You don't know what he looks like. He don't know<br>    what you looks like. So why don't you get someone else to fight the<br>    duel instead of you?<br><br>PR: But I'm the Prince Regent! My portrait hangs on every wall!<br><br>E:  Answer that, Baldrick.<br><br>B:  Well my cousin Bert Baldrick, Mr Gainsborough's butler's dogsbody,<br>    says that he's heard that all portraits look the same these days,<br>    'cause they're painted to a romantic ideal rather than as a true<br>    depiction of the idiosycratic facial qualities of the person in<br>    question.<br><br>E:  (impressed) Your cousin Bert obviously has a larger vocabulary than<br>    you do, Baldrick.<br><br>PR: No, now, he's right damn him. Anybody could fight the duel and<br>    Wellers would never know.<br><br>E:  All the same sir, Baldrick's plan does seem to hinge on finding<br>    someone willing to commit suicide on your behalf.<br><br>PR: Oh yes yes yes, but he would be fabulously rewarded. Money, titles,<br>    castles..<br><br>E:  A coffin, erm...<br><br>B:  That's right, I thought maybe Mr. Blackadder himself would fancy the<br>    job.<br><br>PR: What a splendid idea!<br><br>E:  Excuse me Your Highness. Trouble with the staff.<br><br>(Baldrick and Blackadder leave the room. Blackadder grabs Baldrick by the<br>lapels.)<br><br>E:  Baldrick, does it have to be this way? Our valued friendship ending<br>    with me cutting you into long strips and telling the Prince that you<br>    walked over a very sharp cattlegrid in an extremely heavy hat?<br><br>B:  Mr. Blackadder, you was only just saying in the kitchen how you<br>    wanted to rise again - now here the Prince is offering you the lot.<br><br>E:  But, tiny tiny brain, the Iron Duke will kill me. To even think<br>    about taking him on you'd have to be some kind of homicidal maniac who<br>    was fantastically good at fighting, like McAdder, like McAdder...<br>    (excited) Like McAdder could fight the duel for me!<br><br>(Blackadder re-enters the Prince's bedroom.)<br><br>E:  (calmly) My apologies sir. I was just having a word with my<br>    insurance people. Obviously I would be delighted to die on your<br>    behalf.<br><br>PR: God's toenails Blackadder, I'm most damnably grateful. You won't<br>    regret this you know.<br><br>E:  Well that's excellent. There's just one point though sir, re: the<br>    suicide policy. There's an unusual clause which states that the policy<br>    holder must wear a big red wig and affect a Scottish accent in the<br>    combat zone.<br><br>PR: Small print eh? Huh.<br><br>Mrs Miggins' Coffee Shop<br>------------------------<br><br>(Disarray. Flecks of porridge everywhere. Mrs. Miggins is sitting on a<br>table leaning back on the counter.)<br><br>E:  Ah, Mrs. Miggins. Am I to gather from your look of pie-eyed<br>    exhaustion and the globules of porridge hanging off the walls that my<br>    cousin McAdder has presented his credentials?<br><br>MM: Oh yes indeed sir. You've just missed him.<br><br>E:  I trust he has been practising with his claymore.<br><br>MM: Oooooh, I should say so! I'm as weary as a dog with no legs that's<br>    just climbed Ben Nevis.<br><br>E:  A claymore is a sword, Mrs. Miggins.<br><br>MM: See this intricate wood carving of the infant Samuel at prayer? He<br>    whittled that with the tip of his mighty weapon with his eyes closed.<br><br>E:  Yes, exquisite.<br><br>MM: He bid me bite on a plank, there was a whirlwind of steel, and<br>    within a minute three men lay dead and I had a lovely new set of<br>    gnashers. (grins woodenly)<br><br>E:  Really. Just tell him to meet me here at 5 o'clock, will you? To<br>    discuss an extremely cunning plan. If all goes well by tomorrow the<br>    clan of McAdder will be marching back the high road back to glory.<br><br>MM: Ooh lovely. I'll do you a nice packed lunch.<br><br>The Prince's Quarters<br>---------------------<br><br>(Blackadder enters, looks for the Prince in the lounge and walks through<br>into the bedroom.)<br><br>E:  Good news, Your Majesty. This evening I will carve the Duke into an<br>    attractive piece of furniture with some excellent dental work. Your<br>    Highness? Your Highness!<br><br>(The bedroom door swings closed revealing the Prince hiding behind it,<br>his fingers in his ears.)<br><br>PR: Ooohh! Oh, thank God it's you Blackadder. I've had just word from<br>    Wellington, he's on his way here now.<br><br>E:  Ah, that's awkward. The Duke must believe from the very start that I<br>    am you.<br><br>PR: Hmm, well, hmm, any ideas?<br><br>E:  There's no alternative, we must swap clothes. (starts to take off<br>    his jacket)<br><br>PR: Oh fantastic, yes, dressing up. I love it. It's just like that<br>    story, ah, "The Prince And The Porpoise".<br><br>E:  "..and the Pauper" sir.<br><br>PR: Oh yes! Yes yes yes, "The Prince and the Porpoise and the Pauper".<br><br>(They exchange clothes and wigs.)<br><br>PR: Excellent, excellent. Why, my own father wouldn't recognise me.<br><br>E:  Your own father never can. He's mad.<br><br>PR: Oh yes, yes.<br><br>(They walk through into the lounge.)<br><br>E:  Unfortunately, sir, you do realise that I shall have to treat you<br>    like a servant?<br><br>PR: Oh, I think I can cope with that, thank you, Blackadder.<br><br>E:  And you will have to get used to calling me "Your Highness", Your<br>    Highness.<br><br>PR: "Your Highness, Your Highness."<br><br>E:  No, just "Your Highness", Your Highness.<br><br>PR: That's what I said, "Your Highness, Your Highness", Your Highness,<br>    Your Highness.<br><br>E:  Yes, let's just leave that for now, shall we? Complicated stuff<br>    obviously.<br><br>(Baldrick enters.)<br><br>B:  Big Nose is here... But what?.. Who?.. Where?.. How?..<br><br>E:  Don't even try to work it out Baldrick. Two people you know well<br>    have exchanged coats and now you don't know which is which.<br><br>PR: I must say I'm pretty confused myself! Which one of us is<br>    Wellington?<br><br>E:  (exasperated) Wellington is the man at the door.<br><br>PR: Oh. And the porpoise?<br><br>E:  Hasn't arrived yet sir. We'll just have to fill in as best we can<br>    without it. Sir, if you would let the Duke in.<br><br>PR: Certainly, Your Highness, Your Highness. (leaves)<br><br>E:  And you'd better get out too, Baldrick.<br><br>B:  Yes, Your Highness, Your Highness. (leaves)<br><br>E:  Oh God! If only they had a brain cell between them.<br><br>(The Prince ushers in Wellington.)<br><br>PR: The Duke of Wellington!<br><br>W:  Have I the honour of addressing the Prince Regent, sir?<br><br>E:  You do.<br><br>W:  Hmm, congratulations, Highness, your bearing is far nobler than I'd<br>    been informed... (to the Prince) Take my hat at once, sir, unless you<br>    want to feel my boot in your throat! And be quicker about it than you<br>    were with the door.<br><br>PR: Yes, my lord.<br><br>W:  I'm a Duke not a Lord! (clouts the Prince) Where were you trained,<br>    the Dago dancing class? Shall I have my people thrash him for you,<br>    Highness?<br><br>(The Prince signals "No" from behind Wellington.)<br><br>E:  Errm.. No, he's very new. At the moment I'm sparing the rod.<br><br>W:  Ah! Fatal error. Give them an inch and before you know it they've<br>    got a foot, much more than that and you don't have a leg to stand on.<br>    Get out! (Clouts the Prince). Now sir, to business. I am informed that<br>    your royal father grows ever more eccentric and at present believes<br>    himself to be (reads) "a small village in Lincolnshire, commanding<br>    spectacular views of the Nene valley." I therefore pass on my full<br>    account of the war on to you, the Prince of Wales. (hands Blackadder a<br>    saddle-bag)<br><br>E:  Ah that's excellent. Thank you. (feels in bag, takes out a note) "We<br>    won, signed Wellington." Well, that seems to sum it up very well. Was<br>    there anything else?<br><br>W:  Two other trifling things Highness.. The men had a whip-round and<br>    got you this. Well, what I mean is I had the men roundly whipped until<br>    they got you this. It's a cigarillo case engraved with the regimental<br>    crest of two crossed dead Frenchmen, emblazoned on a mound of dead<br>    Frenchmen motif.<br><br>E:  Thank you very much. And the other trifling thing?<br><br>W:  Your impending death, Highness.<br><br>E:  Oh yes, of course, mind like a sieve.<br><br>W:  Mmm, I can not deny I'm looking forward to it. Britain has the<br>    finest trade, the finest armies, the finest navies in the world. And<br>    what do we have for royalty? A mad Kraut sausage sucker and a son who<br>    can't keep his own sausage to himself. The sooner you're dead the<br>    better.<br><br>E:  You're very kind.<br><br>W:  Now, you're no doubt anxious to catch up with the news of the war. I<br>    have here the most recent briefs from my general in the field...<br><br>E:  Yes, well if you would just like to pop them in the laundry basket<br>    on the way out. Tea?<br><br>W:  Yes, immediately.<br><br>(Blackadder rings the bell.)<br><br>W:  Now, let's turn to the second front, my lord. (unfolds a map on the<br>    table)<br><br>E:  Ah yes. (inspects map) Now, as I understand it Napoleon is in North<br>    Africa. And Nelson is stationed in...<br><br>W:  Alaska. In case Bony should try to trick us by coming via the North<br>    Pole.<br><br>E:  Yes... Perhaps a preferable stratagem, Your Grace, might be to harry<br>    him amid-ships as he leaves the Mediterranean. Trafalgar might be<br>    quite a good spot...<br><br>W:  Trafalgar? Well, I'll mention it to Nelson. I must say I'm beginning<br>    to regret the necessity of killing you, Your Highness. I'd been told<br>    by everybody that the Prince was a confounded moron.<br><br>E:  Oh, no no no no no.<br><br>(The Prince enters with the tea-tray.)<br><br>W:  Oh hell and buckshot! It's that tiresome servant of yours again.<br><br>PR: Ooh, budge up, budge up. (sits down next to Blackadder)<br><br>W:  How dare you, sir, sit in the presence of your betters! Get up!<br><br>PR: Oh yes, cripes. I forgot.<br><br>W:  You speak when you're spoken to. Unless you want to be flayed across<br>    a gun carriage. Well? (hits the Prince)<br><br>E:  Sir, sir, I fear you have been too long a soldier. We no longer<br>    treat servants that way in London society.<br><br>W:  Why, I hardly touched the man!<br><br>E:  Aah, I think you hit him very hard.<br><br>W:  Nonsense ,a hard hit would be like that! (hits the Prince, hard) I<br>    only hit him like that. (once more hits him)<br><br>E:  No sir, a soft hit would be like this. (hits the Prince) Whereas you<br>    hit him like this. (and again, hard)<br><br>PR: (gets back to his feet) Please, um, I wonder if I might be excused,<br>    Your Highness, Your Highness.<br><br>E:  Certainly. (Aside) I'm sorry about that, sir, but one has to keep up<br>    the pretence.<br><br>PR: No, no. I quite understand. You carry on the good work.<br><br>E:  Very well sir. (once more hits him)<br><br>W:  Hang on, this is bloody coffee! I ordered tea! (grabs the Prince by<br>    the ear and drags him back to the table) You really are a confounded<br>    fool. Aren't you? I'd heard everywhere that the Prince was an imbecile<br>    whereas his servant Blackadder was respected about town. Now that I<br>    discover the truth I'm inclined to beat you to death. TEA!! (kicks the<br>    Prince out of the door)<br><br>E:  Tell me, do you ever stop bullying and shouting at the lower orders?<br><br>W:  NEVER! There's only one way to win a campaign: shout, shout and shout<br>    again.<br><br>E:  You don't think then that inspired leadership and tactical ability<br>    have anything to do with it?<br><br>W:  NO! It's all down to shouting. WAAGGHH!<br><br>E:  I hear that conditions in your army are appalling.<br><br>W:  Well I'm sorry, but those are my conditions and you'll just have to<br>    accept them. That is until this evening when I shall kill you.<br><br>E:  Hmm, who knows, maybe I shall kill you.<br><br>W:  Dyaa. Nonsense. I've never been so much as scratched, my skin is as<br>    smooth as a baby's bottom. Which is more than you can say for my<br>    bottom.<br><br>E:  Yes. One point, sir. I should, perhaps, warn you that while duelling<br>    I tend to put on my lucky wig and regimental accent.<br><br>W:  That won't help you. It would take a homicidal maniac in a claymore<br>    and a kilt to get the better of me!<br><br>E:  Well that's handy.<br><br>The Kitchens<br>------------<br><br>PR: I tell you Baldrick, I'm not leaving the kitchen until that man is<br>    out of the house.<br><br>(There is a knock on the door and the bell rings.)<br><br>B:  It's all right, Your Majesty, don't worry, I'll deal with this.<br><br>(The Prince hides behind the scullery door.)<br><br>MM: Ah hello Baldrick. I've brought your buns. Where's Mr. Blackadder?<br>    Oh, not upstairs still, running around after that port-swilling,<br>    tadpole-brained smelly-boots?<br><br>B:  (carefully) I don't know who you mean.<br><br>MM: Prince George, Baldrick. His boots smell so bad a man would need to<br>    have his nose amputated before taking them off. Well, that's what Mr.<br>    Blackadder says.<br><br>B:  As a joke.<br><br>MM: Didn't you write a little poem about him last week?<br><br>B:  No I didn't.<br><br>MM: Ooh you did:<br>        In the Winter it's cool,<br>        In the Summer it's hot,<br>        But all the year round,<br>        Prince George is a clot. (laughs)<br><br>B:  A lovely. I said Prince George is a lovely.<br><br>MM: Oh well. I'd better be off anyway. Tell Mr. Blackadder to expect<br>    Mr. McAdder at five o'clock. Just as soon as that fat Prussian truffle<br>    pig has got his snout wedged into a bucket of tea-cakes. (makes<br>    grunting noises)<br><br>B:  (calls after her) I think it must be next door you're wanting,<br>    strange woman who I've never seen before Mrs. Miggins.<br><br>PR: (sharply) Baldrick!<br><br>B:  Yes, Your Highness?<br><br>PR: Is it true? Did you really write a poem about how lovely I am?<br><br>B:  (fondly) Yes, and Mr. Blackadder loves you too. (smiles sweetly)<br><br>PR: Well I must say. I find that very touching. I do.<br><br>(The bell rings again.)<br><br>PR: I wish they wouldn't keep on doing that.<br><br>The Prince's Lounge<br>-------------------<br><br>W:  Well goodbye sir. And may the best man win. I.e. me.<br><br>PR: Your tea, sir.<br><br>W:  You're late! Where the hell have you been for it, India? (hits him)<br><br>E:  Or Ceylon? (also hits the Prince)<br><br>W:  Or China? (kicks the Prince, who falls down onto the coffee-table)<br>    And don't bother to show me the way out. I don't want to die of old<br>    age before I get to the front door.<br><br>Mrs. Miggins' Coffee Shop<br>-------------------------<br><br>(Blackadder enters, dressed in his normal clothes.)<br><br>E:  Ah! Miggins. So where's McAdder? I thought he was going to be here<br>    at five o'clock.<br><br>MM: Yes, I'm sorry. He's just popped out. You look ever so similar to<br>    each other you know, it's quite eerie.<br><br>E:  (annoyed) Look, did you tell him to be here or not?<br><br>MM: I did, you just keep missing each other. I can't imagine why.<br><br>MA: (enters) I'll tell you why. It's because there's no coffee shop in<br>    England big enough for two Blackadders.<br><br>E:  Ah! Good day, cousin McAdder. I trust you are well.<br><br>MA: Aye, well enough.<br><br>E:  And Morag?<br><br>MA: She bides fine.<br><br>E:  And how stands that mighty army, the clan McAdder?<br><br>MA: They're both well.<br><br>E:  I always thought that Jamie and Angus were such fine boys.<br><br>MA: Angus is a girl. So tell me cousin, I hear you have a cunning plan.<br><br>E:  I do, I do. I want you to take the place of the Prince Regent and<br>    kill the Duke of Wellington in a duel.<br><br>MA: Aye, and what's in it for me?<br><br>E:  Enough cash to buy the Outer Hebrides. What do you think?<br><br>MA: Fourteen shillings and six-pence? Well, it's tempting. But I've got<br>    an even better plan. Why don't I pretend to be the Duke of Wellington<br>    and kill the Prince of Wales in a duel? Then I could kill the King and<br>    be crowned with the ancient stone bonnet of McAdder.<br><br>MM: And I shall wear the granite gown and limestone bodice of MacMiggins,<br>    Queen of all the herds.<br><br>E:  Look, for God's sake, McAdder, you're not Rob Roy. You're a top kipper<br>    salesman with a reputable firm of Aberdeen fishmongers. Don't throw it<br>    all away. If you kill the Prince they'll just send the bailiffs round<br>    and arrest you.<br><br>MA: Oh blast, I forgot the bailiffs.<br><br>E:  So we can return to the original plan then?<br><br>MA: No, I'm not interested. I'd rather go to bed with the Loch Lomond<br>    monster. And besides I have to be back in the office on Friday. I<br>    promised Mr. McNaulty I'd shift a particularly difficult bloater for<br>    him. Forget the whole thing. I'm off home with Miggsy.<br><br>MM: Yes, yes. Show me the glen where the kipper roams free. And forget<br>    Morag forever.<br><br>MA: No, never. Oh, I must do right by Morag. We must return to Scotland<br>    and you must fight in the old Highland way - bare breasted and each<br>    carrying an eight pound baby.<br><br>MM: Oh, yes, yes. I love babies. (kisses McAdder)<br><br>MA: You're a woman of spirit! I look forward to burying you in the old<br>    Highland manner. Farewell Blackadder, you spineless goon! (they leave)<br><br>E:  Oh God! Fortune vomits on my eiderdown once more.<br><br>The Prince's Lounge<br>-------------------<br><br>(Blackadder enters, dressed as the Prince.)<br><br>PR: Ah, Blackadder. It has been a wild afternoon full of strange omens.<br>    I dreamt that a large eagle circled the room three times and then got<br>    into bed with me and took all the blankets. And then I saw that it<br>    wasn't an eagle at all but a large black snake. Also Duncan's horses<br>    did turn and eat each other. As usual. Good portents for your duel, do<br>    you think?<br><br>E:  Not very good sir. I'm afraid the duel is off.<br><br>PR: OFF?<br><br>E:  As in "sod". I'm not doing it.<br><br>PR: By thunder, here's a pretty game. You will stay, sir, and do duty<br>    by your Prince. Or I shall...<br><br>E:  Or what? You port-brained twerp. I've looked after all my life. Even<br>    when we were babies I had to show which bit of your mother was serving<br>    the drinks.<br><br>PR: (kneels) Please please. You've got to help me. I don't want to die.<br>    I've got so much to give. I want more time.<br><br>E:  A poignant plea sir. Enough to melt the stoniest of hearts. But the<br>    answer, I'm afraid, must remain: "You're going to die, fat pig."<br><br>PR: Oh, wait, wait, wait. I'll give you everything.<br><br>E:  Everything?<br><br>PR: Everything.<br><br>E:  The money, the castles,the jewellery?<br><br>PR: Yes.<br><br>E:  The highly artistic but also highly illegal set of French<br>    lithographs?<br><br>PR: Everything.<br><br>E:  The amusing clock where the little man comes out and drops his<br>    trousers every half hour?<br><br>PR: Yes, yes, alright.<br><br>E:  Very well, I accept. A man may fight for many things: his country,<br>    his principles, his friends, the glistening tear on the cheek of a<br>    golden child. But personally I'd mud wrestle my own mother for a ton<br>    of cash, an amusing clock, and a sack of French porn. You're on.<br><br>PR: Hurrah!<br><br>The Duel<br>--------<br><br>E:  Right Baldrick, now here's the plan. When he offers me the swords, I<br>    kick him in the nuts and you set fire to the building. In the<br>    confusion we claim a draw.<br><br>B:  Yes.<br><br>W:  Ah, Your Highness. Let's be about our business.<br><br>E:  Now don't forget Baldrick. You (motions the striking of a match)<br>    when I (raises knee).<br><br>W:  Come sir. Choose your stoker.<br><br>(Wellington holds out a case containing two pink, fluffy cannon stokers.)<br><br>E:  What, are we going to tickle each other to death?<br><br>W:  No sir. We fight with cannon.<br><br>E:  But I thought we were fighting with swords.<br><br>W:  Swords! What do you think this is, the middle ages? Only girls fight<br>    with swords these days. Stand by your gun sir. Hup two three. Hup two<br>    three.<br><br>E:  Wait a minute, what the...<br><br>W:  Stand by cannon for loading procedure... Stoke. Muzzle. Wrench.<br>    (Carries on in this way while Blackadder is talking) Crank the storm<br>    barrel. Pull tee bar.<br><br>E:  "Congratulations on choosing the Armstrong Whitworth four-pounder<br>    cannonette. Please read the instructions carefully and it should give<br>    years of trouble free maiming."<br><br>W:  Check elevation. Chart trajectory. Prime fuse. Aim...<br><br>E:  Look, wait a minute.<br><br>W:  FIRE!<br><br>(The cannon fires. Blackadder drops to the ground. Mournful music strikes<br>up.)<br><br>B:  Mr. B., Mr. B.! Sir, please help me get his coat off.<br><br>E:  Leave it Baldrick. It doesn't matter.<br><br>B:  Yes it does. Blood's hell to shift. I want to get it in to soak.<br><br>W:  You die like a man sir. In combat.<br><br>E:  You think so? Dammit, we must build a better world. When will the<br>    killing end?<br><br>W:  You don't think I too dream of peace? You don't think that I too<br>    yearn to end this damn dirty job we call soldiering?<br><br>E:  Frankly, no. My final wish on this Earth is that Baldrick be sold,<br>    to provide funds for a Blackadder foundation to promote peace, and to<br>    do research into the possibility of an automatic machine for cleaning<br>    shoes. And so I charge... (slumps back)<br><br>W:  His Highness is dead.<br><br>E:  (the music scratches to a halt) Actually, I'm not sure I am.<br>    Fortunately that cigarillo box you gave me was placed exactly at the<br>    point where the cannon-ball struck. (produces a very dented case). I<br>    always said smoking was good for you.<br><br>W:  Ah ha ha. Honour is satisfied. God clearly preserves you for<br>    greatness. His Highness is saved. Hurrah.<br><br>PR: (enters) Umm, no actually it's me, I'm His Highness. Well done<br>    Bladders, glad you made it.<br><br>W:  What in the name of Bonapartes balls is this fellow doing now?<br><br>PR: Ahh, no no, I really am His Highness. It was all just larks, and<br>    darn fine larks at that I thought.<br><br>W:  I have never, in all my campaigns, encountered such insolence! Your<br>    master survives an honourable duel and you cheek him like a French<br>    whoopsy! I can contain myself no longer! (draws his pistol and shoots<br>    the Prince)<br><br>PR: I die. I hope men will say of me that I did duty by my country.<br><br>E:  I think that's pretty unlikely sir. If I was you I'd try for<br>    something a bit more realistic.<br><br>PR: Like what?<br><br>E:  That you hope men will think of you.. as a bit of a thicky.<br><br>PR: All right, I'll hope that then. Toodle-oo everyone. Let you know<br>    and all that. (dies)<br><br>(Horns sound.)<br><br>S:  Here for His Majesty, The King of England.<br><br>K:  Someone told me my son was here. I wish him to marry this rose bush.<br>    I want to make the wedding arrangements.<br><br>E:  (thinking quickly) Here I am, Daddy. This is the Iron Duke,<br>    Wellington, commander of all your armed forces.<br><br>K:  Yes I recognised the enormous conk. Ha ha ha.<br><br>W:  He's a hero. A man of wit and discretion.<br><br>K:  Bravo. You know, my son, for the first time in my life I have a real<br>    fatherly feeling about you. People may say I'm stark raving mad and<br>    say the word Penguin after each sentence, but I believe that we two<br>    can make Britain Great - you as the Prince Regent and I as King<br>    Penguin.<br><br>E:  Well, let's hope eh? Wellington, will you come and dine with us at<br>    the palace? My family have a lot to thank you for.<br><br>W:  Dyahh, with great pleasure. Your father may be as mad as a balloon,<br>    but I think you have the makings of a great king.<br><br>K:  Ah, wunderbar er hoff seiht. Ja.<br><br>E:  Oh and Baldrick? Clear away that dead butler will you.<br><br>(The King, Blackadder and Wellington exit leaving Baldrick cradling the<br>Prince's head)<br><br>B:  (looks up) There's a new star in heaven tonight... A new freckle on<br>    the nose of the giant pixie.<br><br>PR: Erm! No, actually Baldrick, I'm not dead. You see I had a cigarillo<br>    box too, look. (rummages in his jacket) Oh damn, I must have left it<br>    on the dresser... (dies)<br><br>                                 For the<br>                        BENEFIT of SEVERAL VIEWERS<br>                         MR. CURTIS & MR.
