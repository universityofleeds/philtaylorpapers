We are in a hole too deep," said James J. Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, told the Washington Post commenting on Hughes's mission.<br><br>Radwan A. Masmoudi, president of the Center for the Study of Islam and Democracy, said he found during a recent trip to the region that the level of anti-Americanism is "10 times what it was just a year ago."<br><br>Washington's unwavering support for Israel and the invasion-turned-occupation of Iraq have rooted a distrust that Hughes will struggle to counter.<br><br>Mission Impossible<br><br> <br>Many believe Hughes faces a "mission impossible" polishing Washington's image.<br><br> <br>In her tour, Hughes will visit Egypt, one of Washington's top Arab allies and the second recipient of US aid after Israel.<br><br>Mohammed Habib, a leader of the politically banned Muslim Brotherhood, said the US diplomat is facing a "mission impossible, or almost impossible, because Washington has systematically violated all international principles and rights," reported the AFP.<br><br>"They invaded Afghanistan under the pretext of the war on terror, occupied Iraq on false allegations that it had weapons of mass destruction and blindly supported the Zionist entity," he added.<br><br>Sonallah Ibrahim, a prominent Egyptian writer who rejected a literary prize in 2003 to protest cooperation with Washington and Israel, described the US administration as "corrupt, aggressive and contemptuous of human rights".<br><br>"Americans should acknowledge their failure in Iraq, be fair to the Palestinians and end their unconditional support to Israel," he further added.<br><br>Ibrahim maintains that "Arab grievances towards Washington are as irreversible as the US position towards the Arab world."<br><br>"We don't need a PR offensive, because it's pointless to create satellite radio and TV channels to win the hearts and minds," he said in reference to Al-Hurra satellite channel and Radio Sawa, launched with US funds after the Iraqi war.<br><br>America's 2005 behemoth budget is earmarking huge appropriations to the State Department and the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) in a bid to shine up the country's blemished image worldwide and protect its interests. <br><br><br>
