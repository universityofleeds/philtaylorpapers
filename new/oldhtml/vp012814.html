<A HREF="http://www.bbg.gov/"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=http://www.bbg.gov></A> <br><br>Alhurra, New Arabic-Language Satellite Network, Begins Broadcasting February 14 <br><br><br><br>Alhurra, a new Arabic-language satellite television network, will begin broadcasting to millions of viewers in 22 countries across the Middle East on February 14, 2004.<br><br>Alhurra (Arabic for "The Free One") will be devoted primarily to news and information. In addition to reporting on regional and international events, the channel will broadcast discussion programs, current affairs magazines and features on a variety of subjects including health and personal fitness, entertainment, sports, fashion, and science and technology. The channel is dedicated to presenting accurate, balanced and comprehensive news.<br><br>Alhurra is operated by The Middle East Television Network, Inc., a non-profit corporation funded by the U.S. Congress through the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG). The BBG is a federal agency that supervises all U.S. nonmilitary international broadcasting. The channel will broadcast from studios in Springfield, Virginia and bureaus throughout the Middle East.<br><br>"Our competitive edge in the Middle East is our very dedication to truth and free and open debate. And we will stand out like a beacon of light in a media market dominated by sensationalism and distortion," said BBG Chairman Kenneth Y. Tomlinson.<br><br>Norman J. Pattiz, chairman of the BBG's Middle East Committee who spearheaded development of Alhurra, said, "Alhurra will present fresh perspectives for viewers in the Middle East that we believe will create more cultural understanding and respect." <br><br>"A key part of our mission is to be an example of a free press in the American tradition," he added. "We've assembled a highly professional group of journalists primarily from the region to provide the kind of news and information that will resonate with our viewing audience and enable them to make informed decisions."<br><br>Alhurra will debut with a 14-hour per day program schedule and expand to 24 hours within weeks. Prime time programming will include two, one-hour in-depth newscasts, a nightly live talk show called "Free Hour," and Arabic translations of documentary and information programming from producers around the world. The prime time broadcast schedule will be posted daily on the channel's web site: <A HREF="http://www.alhurra.com/"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=www.alhurra.com></A>.<br><br>Alhurra will be available to viewers in the Middle East on the region's two major satellite systems: Arabsat and Nilesat.<br><br> <br><br><br>
