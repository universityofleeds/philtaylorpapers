In the 16 Day tour which ended June 8th, the group performed 7 shows in 5 countries and attended dozens of smaller "Meet and Greet" visits for US and Coalition forces stationed in Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Qatar. <br><br><br><br>Let Freedom Wing Photos! See the "Let Freedom Wing" Tour in action in our exclusive photo gallery! The tour which was hosted by Armed Forces Entertainment featured a 90 minute variety show packed with Music, humor and beautiful Hooters Girls. UC3, the dynamic new girl singing group, which Hooters sponsors, performed selections from their soon to released debut CD as well as classic patriotic and "torch" songs such as the National Anthem, the 4 Service Anthems and Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy. The show ended with a bang when UC3 sang "Anywhere USA" accompanied by 6 flag waving Hooters Calendar Girls sporting Hooters latest Military appreciation uniform, featuring camouflage patterned shorts and a tank top with the line "Weapons of Mass Distraction" on the back. The show, which was designed to resemble the classic Bob Hope USO tours, was described by many troops as the most fun and best attended Morale show in years. Hooters of America Vice President of Marketing, Mike McNeil who acted as the show's MC said, "It is an honor for the Hooters concept to be able to support the men and women in the service of our country. I was absolutely blown away at the positive reaction we received. I can't imagine playing to a more appreciative audience." <br><br>During the tour, the Hooters Group distributed 2,000 Calendars; 20,000 Let Freedom Wing Lapel Pins; 10,000 posters and 10,000 decks of special Hooters Calendar playing cards featuring 2 special "Jokers" Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. The 7 shows were attended by over 15,000 troops and UC3 and the 6 Calendar Girls figure they signed over 100,000 autographs on the special tour merchandise. <br><br>Plans are already underway for a follow up tour. "We will definitely be ready to go again soon. There are a lot of troops we did not get a chance to see this time. Based on the considerable request we received, we will have to figure out a way to take Hooters chicken wings, as well as the girls next time," stated Mike McNeil. <br><br><br>
