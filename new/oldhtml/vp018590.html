He called Gadahn's latest message "part of al-Qaida's sustained propaganda efforts against the U.S." <br><br>National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said Sunday: "This just shows once again, al-Qaida offers nothing but violence and death. The purpose of President Bush's trip is to meet with mainstream Arab leaders and people to talk about a positive future for the region, based on hope and opportunity." <br><br>As for Gadahn's tearing up his U.S. passport, Johndroe said: "He is wanted for treason against the United States. His passport was already void." <br><br>During the rest of the 50-minute video, titled "An Invitation to Reflection and Repentance," Gadahn, who was raised in Orange County, Calif., spoke mostly in English, appearing to specifically address the American people. He said al-Qaida felt the need to release the statement after Washington's "defeat" in Iraq and Afghanistan and failed attempts by the Bush administration to bring peace to the Middle East. <br><br>"We felt it necessary to address the American people and explain to them some of the facts about these critical and fast-moving events," said Gadahn, who wore a white-and-red headscarf and sat behind a desk with a laptop computer and coffee mug nearby. <br><br>"The first questions Americans might ask is, has America really been defeated? The answer is yes and on all fronts," he added. <br><br><br><br>
