Reports of the overall death toll varied, with the U.S. military saying nine died while the Afghan government put the number killed at 23, with two dozen injured.<br><br>The bomber struck about 10 a.m. and U.S. military officials declared a "red alert" at the sprawling Bagram Air Base while Cheney was rushed to a bomb shelter. Cheney later met President Hamid Karzai in the capital before heading back to the United States via the Gulf state of Oman. "I heard a loud boom," he told reporters aboard Air Force Two. "The Secret Service came in and told me there had been an attack on the main gate."<br><br>Many of the victims were said to be Afghan truck drivers waiting to get inside the base. Although the bomber did not get within roughly a mile of the vice president, the attack highlighted the precarious security situation posed by the resurgent Taliban.<br><br>Five years after U.S.-led forces toppled their regime, Taliban-led militants have increased attacks, with 139 suicide bombings last year, a fivefold increase over 2005, and a fresh wave of violence is expected this spring.<br><br>The Taliban have attacked in the area north of the capital in the past, and the top spokesman for the NATO force said yesterday the Taliban had a cell in Kabul that could have traveled the 30 miles north to Bagram.<br><br>A message posted on a Web site used by militants said "a mujahid [holy warrior] ... carried out a suicide attack. ... The target was Bush's vice president, Dick Cheney." But a U.S. spokesman said Cheney was in a "very safe and secure place" roughly a mile from the blast site. "To characterize this as a direct attempt on the life of the vice president is absurd," he said.<br><br>During their private hour-long meeting, Cheney and Karzai spoke about the "problems coming from Pakistan," an Afghan government official said, a reference to cross-border infiltration by militants who launch attacks in Afghanistan. Karzai's office said Cheney told Afghan leaders the United States "will continue its assistance to Afghanistan." <br>Copyright 2007 Newsday Inc.<br><br><br>
