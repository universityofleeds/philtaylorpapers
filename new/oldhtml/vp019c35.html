From the suburbs surrounding Baghdad airport, the terrorists regularly fire on planes with machine guns and missiles. .. Iraq teeters on the edge of civil war.<br><br>Paul Bremer 1.26 - 1.33 <br>We came here to do a noble thing.

We have some time left but not much time.<br><br><br>1.48 - 2.00soldiers check cars people 01.49 - The continuing carnage here can only diminish the US' chances of holding the peace.<br><br>Col David Teeples 3rd Armoured Cavalry Regt 2.00 - 2.02 <br>Q: Is this a popular insurgency?<br><br>A: It isn't. It is not.<br><br>Q: Are you winning?<br><br>A: We are winning.<br><br>2.02 - 3.31Colonel Teeples' Into Blackhawk helicopter - low level flight over Baghdad outskirts and Industrial area - gun fired into desert - cutaways Teebles and Reporter. 02.03 - As Commander of America's Third Armoured Cavalry Regiment, Colonel David Teeples is proud of its 150 year history. 02.14 - He's invited us to join him on a flight across dangerous country, to one of his bases on the Syrian border. UPSOT gun fired 02.23 - Guns are test-fired then we're off at low-level across the desert. We're in what's called the Sunni Triangle - the central part of Iraq that's home for most of the country's Sunni Moslem population, the heartland of Saddam Hussein's support. 02.42 - The Third Armoured Cavalry - the 'Brave Rifles' - as they are known - have suffered some of the highest casualty rates in Iraq. <br><br>Teeples INT chopper 02.50 -03.11 <br>We had a soldier, the first one was on the first of May. And ah we had a memorial. And I said to the Regimental Command Sergeant-Major 'I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to have any more of these memorials.

In their homes. 03.31 - A few hours later we join Colonel Teeples' men in the back of an armoured vehicle heading out for night patrol in the town of Qusabah. It's a major trouble-spot for the Americans, in the province of Al Quaim, close to the Syrian border. Terrorists have been firing mortar bombs from here into the US base. UPSOT: FX Tracer rounds hitting target03. 52 - A last minute weapons check then we move into town.03.57 - There's a nine o'clock curfew.

But their suspect has got away. Then we're called across town to where helicopters have spotted a resident arriving home shortly after curfew. UPSOT 04.33 - Soldier: Question first, if it looks suspicious you've got permission to search.. 04.40 - Many foreign fighters - including suspected Al Quaeda terrorists - were transiting through border towns like this, answering Osama Bin Laden's call for a jihad - or holy war - against the Coalition invaders. UPSOT: 04.53 - Soldier : Why was your truck moving after curfew?04.55 - As War began, this little town and others along the border were full of weapons and fighters. UPSOT: 05.03 - US Soldier: & so the best way to stay out of trouble is to be in their house before nine o'clock<br><br>Col David Teeples 3rd Armrd Cav Cmmdr 5.12 - 5.25 <br>We closed down the Syrian border completely. We allowed no traffic to come in or out. We went through and searched nearly 8,000 homes and we captured, actually detained, about 380 prisoners and we have been capturing and putting away a lot of these people that were establishing some kind of a equipment and money and training base so that they could move further into the country and perform jihad. <br><br>5.25 - 5.43 <br>US soldiers at base - tanks - general scenes preparing for patrol - silhouette tank gunner.<br><br>5.43 - 6.06Soldiers help cleaning up streets of Baghdad suburb - shaking hands with locals 05.45 - But to get the intelligence they need to defeat the jihadists, the Americans have waged a campaign to win the hearts and minds of local Iraqis.UPSOT: 05.55 - Soldier " We appreciate you're help out here this morning<br><br>Col David Teeples - 3rd Armrd Cav Commander 6.06 - 6.17 <br>We decided when we would go into a home, if they were compliant with the Centcomm weapons policy and they did not have any contraband we would give them $20. I can't remember how many thousands of dollars we gave out.<br><br>6.17 - 6.42Int Baghdad home, soldiers question family - nightscope vision - includes 2 shots of armed Iraqis in plain clothes patrolling streets with US soldiers. 06.18 - 20 US dollars might not sound like much but that's more than the average Iraqi earns in a week.<br><br>Col David Teeples: 6.27 - 6.51 <br>The way that you beat an insurgency is by having the population take over the fight. And win their own communities. Win their own country. And they're doing that in the form that local Police are becoming more professional and they coming more credible with the population.<br><br>6.51 - 9.10Soldiers on patrol nightvision kicking in doors and confronting persons of suspicion inside the house - Iraqi with his hands up - Soldiers firing inside house towards upstairs - soldiers beating Iraqi - close up Iraqi with bloodied nose - Iraqi family (including women) sitting on floor with hands on their heads. 06.52 - The Americans also need to win the hearts and minds of Iraqis. But that's not helped by aggressive raids like this one carried out by troops not under the command of Col. Teebles, filmed by a news service camera-crew.07.11 - It's the dead of night, outside the house of a senior former Iraqi Army officer. He's suspected of helping the insurgents.07.22 - The officer's son - thinking the soldiers are thieves - goes to the roof of the house and fires into the air to scare them away. That's a big mistake.UPSOT: 07.31 - SOLDIER shouts: "We're got a shooter on the roof" &. (sustained gunfire) 07.43 - Inside the house the officer surrenders&.UPSOT: 07. 47 - IRAQI OFFICER: " Welcome, Welcome" .. SOLDIER shouts: "Get out here now" IRAQI OFFICER: "Welcome welcome".. 07.50 - &but he doesn't understand what the Americans are saying - and they don't have a translator. UPSOT: 07.56 - SOLDIER: "Want me to shoot him in the leg&. I might shoot you...Get the fuck over here .. Get the fuck over here now .. I'd get him in the leg .. Shoot him in the foot &" 08.11 - The Iraqi officer can now be heard praying.UPSOT: 0.17 - IRAQI prays .. SOLDIER: "Who the fuck are you talking to? Shut the fuck up! .. I'm at the door & (gunfire) .. get him outta here, go, go. IRAQI: "Welcome, welcome". SOLDIER: "Shut the fuck up .. who is shooting? IRAQI: "Welcome welcome". SOLDIER: "Fucking shut up, shut up .. 08.39 - The soldiers capture the young man on the roof.UPSOT: 08.43 - (gunfire and scream ) SOLDIER: "Alright get him the fuck out of here .. (screaming young man) ... SOLDIER: 'Take the camera off'. 09.00 - No-one here was killed&but, it's raids like this that can only fuel the resentment against Coalition forces.<br><br>9.11 - 10.54 Gun-Camera B&W Infrared footage of 3 suspected Iraqi insurgents in a field standing by a truck, pick-up truck and tractor - one runs into field and dumps what looks like a weapon wrapped in cloth - another does the same thing with smaller object - a third insurgent arrives on tractor alights and walks over to truck - all three are shot by helicopter guns - one in field, one by tractor and another under a truck - third person fired on again after being wounded. UPSOT: 09.11 - Pilot on microphone: "A big truck over here .. having a little pow-wow" ..09. 13 - Concerns are circulating in Baghdad too among America's Coalition allies about this extraordinary gun camera vision shot by a US Apache helicopter gunship in December last year. UPSOT: 09. 24 - PILOT1 : "He's running of into the field. Do you see this? & Pilot2: Yep. PILOT1: "I got a guy here running, throwing a weapon& PILOT2: Smoke him".. 09.30 - No one doubts the US has had to take a tough line against the local Iraqi fighters who have mounted a determined insurgency against the Coalition forces. And this covert night vision filmed from an Apache hovering nearly two kilometres away shows a man dumping what may well be a weapon in a field.UPSOT: 09.50 - BASE: "Are you certain it was a weapon&..Pilot1: "Positive" 09.53 - A prudent Commander would at least attempt to capture these men - their intelligence might help break up the resistance among locals in the Sunni Triangle. But instead the order is given to 'Smoke 'em' - to kill three unarmed men in cold blood. UPSOT: 10.12 - PILOT!: "Range auto .. BASE: right got auto range on it? .. PILOT1: "Roger" & BASE: " Hit him" .. (gunfire) .. PILOT1: Got him. BASE: "Good" PILOT1:" The second one" & BASE: "Hit the other one. & (gunfire) .. PILOT 2: "Hit the truck. .. go to the right see if anyone's moving by the truck.. Is there anyone in the truck. & Wait for movement. PILOT1: "Not seeing any". PILOT2: Good store that auto range store .. wait there another guy.. PILOT1:"There's movement right there" .. Fire him.. PILOT2: Hit him. ..

That the Americans will always choose the best choice after trying all the other choices. <br><br>Q: So they're allowed to make mistakes. But you think in the long run things will work out for the best?<br><br>A: No, they are doing a lot of mistakes. <br><br>Q: The Americans say that if they give power to the Iraqi groups too early they risk failure and that failure here could bring the whole peace process undone.<br><br>A: And do you think that the Americans governing the whole country will lead to success?<br><br>Q: Well what is your warning to the Americans?<br><br>A: They have to depend on Iraqis. <br><br>Q: And if they don't -<br><br>A: - They have to give the Iraqis the choice to lead themselves.<br><br>Q: And if they don't?<br><br>A: They came here as liberators as they say, not as occupiers. They have not to make the mistake to be occupiers. <br><br>12.08 - 13.11Helicopter aerials of the al Tubaitha nuclear reactor just outside Baghdad. 12.18 - Al Tubaitha - under Saddam this was one of the sites of Iraq's attempted nuclear weapons program. The Americans hoped they might find the elusive weapons of mass destruction here.12.38 - But that pretext for last year's invasion now hangs in tatters. Coalition troops find themselves cast as occupiers by an increasingly hostile Iraqi population - most of whom are grateful for their liberation but who now want the Americans to leave.12.58 - There is another reason too for the seething resentment among many Iraqis towards America - one the US military has yet to acknowledge. <br><br>Piece to Camera at Daura cluster bomb site 13.11 - 14.03 <br>What happened here at Daura on the southern outskirts of Baghdad, five days before American tanks rolled up the highway here to Baghdad, raises very serious concerns about whether America acted in breach of its international humanitarian law obligations about the use of cluster bombs. In the first salvo two cluster bombs were dropped to knock out an artillery position here and another one just in front of me. You might argue that's fair enough, Saddam Hussein had located guns near to residential areas. But it's what happened ten minutes later that's of serious concern. For ten minutes later a guided missile was dropped - not here - but across that motorway, only metres from the residences. Dozens of innocent civilians were slaughtered.<br><br><br>14.03 - 14.22Children running over ground littered with unexploded cluster bombs.. 14.31 - 14.45Dr Rasmi and his children in his backyard showing cluster bomb damage. 14.08 - When we visited Daura within weeks of the invasion, locals were bitter with anger at the use of a battlefield mass killing weapon so close to their homes. Upsot: Daura Resident 14.22 - 14.31" The civilians come to help them because some of them had been injured on the other side. When they make a mass here the cluster bomb" &(EXPLOSION) &REPORTER: "Bloody hell" .. RESIDENT: "Still now there's some bombs". 14.34 - This hospital physician Dr Hamza Rasmi showed us how the cluster bomblets sprayed his family home with shrapnel.<br><br>Doctor Rasmi 14.45 - 15.24 <br>The first one fall on the soldiers, the next one on the civilian population. When we get out of the home we see the civilian population, injured population, dead people on the street. (Referring to his two small boys) .. At the time of explosion they were crying and was very afraid. One of them urinate on himself and next he fall on glass and you can see the wound on his hand .. you see the shell, every five centimetres there is a shell so it is very dangerous, no-one will escape from it.<br><br><br>15.24 - 16.07 Ross and Aida al-Ansari coming up stairs to enter her son Fahad's bedroom - stills of Fahad al-Ansari - Aida shows us Fahad's blood-stained jeans with holes in them from shrapnel. 15.33 - Last year Aida al-Ansari's 16-year-old son Fahad and 25 other civilians were killed as the Americans fought their way into Baghdad.Aida Al-Ansari 15.40 - 16.07Full of blood. I didn't throw it because I wanted his blood to stay with me. Q - Do you know how many wounds he had?A: A lot, I couldn't count. One, two, three, four, five and then I stop. I can't help it'. <br><br>16.07 - 16.55Daura suburb scenes Baghdad with old artillery piece among houses - unexploded cluster bomb right next to house - close up bomblets and damage to houses - still photos of Fahad al-Ansari. 16.09 - Shortly after the war ended we filmed the result here of what was clearly a terrible error by the Americans. A US jet missed these artillery positions and dropped a cluster bomb on nearby houses.16.23 - A weapon designed for clearing open battlefields, these large canisters spray tiny bomblets over a huge area. And some live bomblets were still there when we filmed.16.37 - When they explode, they send a hail of shrapnel in all directions. Aida's son Fahad was taken to hospital, riddled with fragments. And there, the doctor had no anaesthetic.<br><br>Aida al-Ansari 16.55 - 17.44 <br>So he's trying to pull the bullets from his leg and his feet and his arms and his face and his shoulders and he was screaming. Each time he screamed I run to him and I cuddle him. I said to him 'Why Fahad, why that's happened to you? [Cries]' He said please Mummy don't cry. Then he turned to his father and he said 'Daddy, please forgive me for what I done to you and to my Mum.' <br><br>17.44 - 18.01Daura suburb scenes houses, artillery guns - cluster bomb canisters sticking out of the ground - still photo Fahad and friends 17.44 - In all the arguments about the merits of this war, little attention has been paid to the uncounted numbers of Iraqi civilians who've died because of Coalition mistakes. Including Fahad.<br><br>Aida al-Ansari 18.01 - 18.36 <br>Then I saw them pull the sheet over his face put it over his face so I knew it was over. I knew it was the end. My lovely boy gone. I didn't want to leave him. Then I shouted please get me a scissor. I cut piece of his hair. For memory. This is all I get left of Fahad. Piece of hair. <br><br>18.36 - 18.47Reporter in street talking to amall group of residents 18.36 - Ten months since we were last in Daura, grief among Fahad's family and friends has now hardened to anger against the US.<br><br>Aida al-Ansari 18.47 - 19.15 <br>They hate them. They don't hate the people but they hate Bush and the Army.<br><br><br>Q: Did they hate the United States before this war?<br><br>A: No. Everybody used to dream to go to the United States, to work or to do something. <br><br>Q: &Has anyone from the Coalition ever come to you or to this community and apologised for what happened?<br><br>A: No. No-one. <br><br><br>19.15 - 19.30Marla Ruzicka in her office flat with reporter.19.30 - 20.05Street scenes Baghdad market - Young boys in shop with handgun - children and shopkeepers - top shot of Baghdad suburbs 19.15 - Marla Ruzicka is one American who does care. Her organisation CIVIC - Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict - has painstakingly catalogued the names of at least 2,000 civilians killed during the war, but is confident there were many more. She is now trying to find the money to list the civilians who have died since President Bush declared the end of the conflict on May 1st last year.<br><br>Marla Ruzicka 20.05 - 20.35 <br>A: The will and the hearts and the minds of the Iraqi people are vital. They're extremely educated. They're smart. They're resourceful. And they're tough. And they're warm and they're wonderful just like people everywhere. But right now the US and other Coalition Governments have an opportunity to set things right after so many years of things going wrong here. And that's to assist people who got caught up during the military operations during the war the and post May 1st. We need to look at every individual acid case.<br><br>Q: If they don't?<br><br>A: If they don't there's - they're seeing it - each month there's more attacks on US soldiers and each month people's hearts in Iraq get a little bit more broken as they don't have electricity, water. It could mean the difference between if they make and they don't. <br><br>20.35 - 21.15Air to Air shots of US Blackhawk helicopter flying over Baghdad. - aerials of suburbs . 20.36 - Of course, democracy never had a chance under Saddam's brutal rule. But, can it ever work? 84 years ago, a British colonial administrator made the grim prediction that the new Iraq created back then by the British welding of Shia and Sunni Moslem groups and the Kurds would be the 'antithesis of democratic government'. That it could never function as a single country. .. 21.06 - The Americans now have the Herculean task of proving that prediction wrong. <br><br>21.15 - 21.22 <br>US tanks and soldiers stationed on Baghdad streets<br><br>21.22 - 21.30Reporter with Brooke in his office 21.22 - The Iraqi National Congress' political advisor, Francis Brooke, is the eternal optimist:<br><br>Francis Brooke - INC political advisor 21.30 - 22.02 <br>Q: Let me put the pessimistic point of view to you that Saddam Hussein was an authoritarian strongman who kept all of these disparate groups, - warring tribes together, now that democracy is being imposed on Iraq, the whole pla e is going to fall apart?<br><br>A: Anything is better than Saddam. Anything is better than the type of totalitarian state on fascist lines that he constructed anything is better than Saddam, anything is better for the Iraqi people and anything is better for the outside world. Anarchy is better!<br><br>22.02 -22.23 Soldiers pose for photographs under 'Sword Bridge'22.23 - 24.16Interior CAP HQ Press Conference with Bremer and CAP members. 22.06 - America has repeatedly assured Iraqis it's here to liberate them - not to conquer them. But sceptical Iraqis say that's exactly what the British said last century when it invaded Iraq and installed a puppet monarchy. If the Coalition administration is trying to avoid an imperial image, it's sending all the wrong messages by installing itself in one of the royal palaces of the former dictator.UPSOT: 22.35 - "testing .. testing is it clean? .. 22.38 - US Ambassador Paul Bremer is meeting the impatient Iraqi political leadership for the first time, behind these closed doors. It's at this meeting that US disenchantment with local leaders first becomes apparent. 22.57 - This is a key chance to restore faith with Iraqis that the new rulers here actually know what they're doing. UPSOT: 23.05 - Bremer: 'While conditions have improved in most of the country, there are parts of the country, particularly here in Baghdad where we agreed we need to do some work in restoring law and order.'23.17 - We're assured we'll later be able to ask him some of the hard questions. Such as why is he dragging his feet on a new Iraqi Government? & Why does America seems to have been caught so unprepared for the scale of damage to Baghdad's basic utilities: the water and power?...What solutions does he have to restore law and order? 23.41 - But the event soon becomes a debacle. UPSOT : 23.45 - Journalists calling out..23.48 - Ducking questions, Ambassador Bremer walks out. UPSOT: 23.54 - Arab journalists calling out..24.00 - Arab journalists are angry there's no opportunity to question Bremer. After four hours wait for the promised opportunity to question the Ambassador, we're told he wants to go to dinner. UPSOT: 24.11 - Arab Journalist: "Bloody Hell" ..<br><br><br>24.16 - 27.42Wailing women at al- Hillah massacre site south of Baghdad - exhuming graves - people in grief checking plastic bags of human bones - blessing rituals prior to reburials - general activity collecting information - relatives searching for missing family members. 24.21 - The other open wound here that the Americans have yet to adequately respond to, is an accounting for the crimes that were committed in the name of Saddam Hussein. <br><br>UPSOT: wailing women 24.37 - In blistering 40 degree heat, on a desolate dry plain near the Iraqi town of Al-Hillah, Mu'teez Hussein is searching for his brothers.24.50 - Both disappeared in 1991, taken off the street by Saddam's security forces as it crushed an uprising by the majority Shiite population.<br><br>Mu'teez Hussein 25.01 - 25.17 <br>Subtitles: - I am trying to identify him through the identification card and the picture and the clothes.<br><br>25.07 Q: And have you found anything yet?<br><br>25.09 - Subtitles: - Nothing yet .. They were my brothers and they were innocent people like the others. What did they do? They were innocent people.<br><br>Wailing woman UPSOT: wailing..25.24 - Across Iraq at numerous sites like this now being uncovered, many grief-stricken people are asking themselves that same question.<br><br>Wailing woman beating her face 25.35: <br>Subtitles - I can't believe my eyes. Is this you, the son of my mother.<br><br>Second woman 25.42 : <br>Subtitles - Not even the dogs died like this 25.47 - Oh God why did all the young people die like this?<br><br>Jaber Mohsin Al-Husseini - Farmer witness to the murders: 25.58 - 26.47 <br>Subtitles - They organised themselves in different duties. They gathered all these people in this huge camp and then started to blindfold them and bind their hands and then dug a big hole and pushed people alive into it. Because many people started resisting as they were being put into the hole they were kicked forcibly into it. Then about five or six people started shooting them altogether. Then they started to bury them with a mechanical shovel. <br>Rough English Translation 26.02 - When they collected the people, they divided them into divisions, so each day they bring one division .. and after that they tie their hands and shut their eyes with a piece of rag or something and they bring them all here .. and they dig a big hole in the ground and they start to push people into these holes because people when they are handcuffed, they cannot control their stance or cannot control anything so they pushed them into this hole and when they fell, five or six men start to shoot down on them with their Kalashnikov or anything and when they were all dead, they burned them. - 26.47 <br><br><br>Reporter - 26.55 - 27.21 <br>The scale and the barbarity of the violence here is difficult to comprehend.

American troops had rushed past to take Baghdad, leaving the refinery unprotected. So Dathar handed weapons out to his workers. <br><br>Dathar al-Kashab - Daura Oil Refinery 44.49 - 45.23: <br>'We had to fight it off and sometimes they shot, during the shooting we I got one of my crude tanks on fire and I had to fire-fight at the same time fire-fight also outside.

Iraq has the world's third largest proven oil reserves. It also has the largest probable oil reserves. When that oil begins to flow onto the world market in several years, its impact on the OPEC oil cartel controlled by the World's main oil producing nations will be dramatic - perhaps slashing the World price of crude oil. <br><br>Dathar al-Kashab 45.55 - 46.38 <br>Q: 'The conspiracy theory has it that what the Americans are all about is gaining control of Iraqi's oilfields - the world's, I think, second-largest oilfields - so they can force down the price of oil and break OPEC?'<br><br>46.14 - A: 'This is a result, the result. This is not a conspiracy. I mean once you are talking about getting the second reserve in the world, obviously the result is to control the prices, or at least you can control the prices when you like. Iraq will be a very big contender to the Saudi portion of production'. <br><br>46.38 - flares from refinery - oil lake with bubbling oil, tanks etc, 46.41 - When Saddam Hussein's Iraq was hit with sanctions after it invaded Kuwait in 1990, Saudi Arabia - the world's biggest oil producer - picked up the bulk of Iraq's oil quota. <br><br>Francis Brooke - INC Political Advisor 46.55 -47.41 <br>Q: ' Is there any possibility that Iraq would consider taking itself out of OPEC'?<br><br>A: 'Yeah, I think there probably is. Again I think that's a decision the Iraqi people are probably going to have to take for themselves. But there certainly is a strong moral argument that OPEC nations who absorbed Iraq's production capacity and turned it into their own production capacity over the intervening ten or twelve years have some responsibility to Iraq. And I would be surprised if there isn't a mechanism where by they can all come to a mutual agreement. But if there was no mutual agreement I think Iraq would be well within its rights and would be only serving the interests of its own people to go ahead and set production levels in their own interests'.<br><br><br>47.41 - 48.00various shots refinery at dusk yellow sky - smoke/steam from stacks - silhouettes machinery, stacks etc. 47.44 - Already the US is being accused of abusing its power here in Iraq - by awarding, without tender, the major oil infrastructure rebuilding contract to US construction giant Haliburton.<br><br>Hoshiar Zebari Spokesman Kurdish Democratic Party and CPA Foreign Minister 48.01 -48.19 <br>We are concerned really.

My response is this. Who has used who. After all, whose army is in the other's country liberating them? The US is here liberating Iraq from Saddam Hussein.

There's talk of permanent American military bases here in Iraq and once you've seen this sprawling Al Asad airbase three hours west of Baghdad - another of Saddam Hussein's follies - it's not hard to see why if you were an American policymaker, you wouldn't be leaving in a hurry. 3416 Israel's just minutes flying time by jet in that direction. Syria, same thing in that direction. An unstable Saudi Arabia, about ten minutes by fighter in that direction. And Iran about the same time over there.

Hundreds of young men and women dead, many thousands injured.The pretext for this war was Saddam's weapons of mass destruction. With none yet found, there are many taxpayers now questioning whether their own countries are a safer place since last year's invasion.<br><br>Paul Bremer 53.52 - 54.25 <br>Q: Why is the world a safer place because we have toppled Saddam Hussein?<br><br>A: It is a safer place because we have gotten rid of one of the most awful dictators in the region. A man who was at war with all of his neighbours at various times and at war with his own people all the time. <br><br><br>Q: So you disagree with the notion that this was a sideshow in the war against terrorism? <br><br>A: Oh this is an essential front of the war on terrorism.
