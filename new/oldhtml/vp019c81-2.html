He added the security of US soldiers came first before any hearts and minds operation.<br><br>Those particular pictures provoked a huge, mixed response from Aljazeera users who inundated the website with feedback expressing concern.<br><br>This latest series of pictures was sent to US military headquarters Centcom in Florida for a comment. Major David Farlow warned Aljazeera.net not to publish the pictures on this site.<br><br>"It would be irresponsible. I can't second guess what has happened here without knowing all the facts but US forces operating in Iraq have to use the appropriate level of restraint to the mission.<br><br>"US soldiers will use minimum forces wherever possible," he added.<br><br>However John Rees, head of the British Stop The War Coalition, condemned the behaviour of the occupying forces.<br><br>Colonial occupiers<br><br>"This kind of behaviour produced a response which forced the British out of India and will undoubtedly force the British and Americans out of Iraq.<br><br> <br>This picture shows a US soldier<br>frisking a four-year-old Afghan<br> <br><br>"The American and British forces in Iraq are showing all the worst traits of colonial occupying forces throughout history."<br><br>A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Defence in London said: "There are a range of options available to the commander on the ground based on the information received. Restraint depends on the situation."<br><br>However a senior military source said: "This sort of action would be highly unusual for British troops and would have to be authorised at the highest level.<br><br>"We just don't do things like that. We are working very closely with Iraqi people on the ground in Basra and prioritise in winning hearts and minds.<br><br>"We made a dreadful error earlier on in the campaign and lost some military police as a result. It was a tragedy which we have learned from and do not want to repeat."<br><br><br>Aljazeera<br>By Yvonne Ridley and Lawrence Smallman<br><br>You can find this article at:<br><A HREF="http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/6B135A01-B99C-41C1-B36A-53197281D21E.htm"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/6B135A01-B99C-41C1-B36A-53197281D21E.htm></A> <br><br><br>
