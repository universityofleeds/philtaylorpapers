<A HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/1/hi/england/2951888.stm"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/1/hi/england/2951888.stm></A><br><br><br><br>Shopworker 'sickened' by POW photos <br><br><br>A photography shop assistant has described her horror at photos that allegedly showed Iraqi prisoners of war being mistreated. <br><br>Kelly Tilford, 22, raised the alarm after developing the film in the shop where she works in Tamworth, Staffordshire. <br><br>She said: "I felt sick when I looked at the pictures. They were grim. I just felt awful." <br><br>Military police are continuing to question an 18-year-old British soldier who is in custody in connection with the film. <br><br>Ms Tilford said: "There were just a couple of photos with a couple of soldiers in the pictures. <br><br>"I showed them to a colleague and she called the police straight away. <br><br>"They came to where I work and I had to give them a full statement." <br><br>One of the images allegedly showed an Iraqi, bound and gagged, hanging from a rope on a fork-lift truck. <br><br>Ms Tilford told the Sun newspaper the Iraqi looked "petrified". <br><br><br>I am as proud as anybody of what our forces did out there - but there are rules <br>Kelly Tilford <br>"I will never forget that terrible stare. I immediately thought, 'That's not right'," she said. <br><br>She added: "I don't feel guilty about calling in the police. I know people who have been fighting in Iraq. <br><br>"I am as proud as anybody of what our forces did out there - but there are rules. <br><br>"I would not want any of my friends to be treated like those Iraqis on the photographs. <br><br>"We are a great nation. But we would lose our self-respect and much more besides if we allowed ourselves and our troops to stoop this low." <br><br>MoD 'appalled' <br><br><br>If the pictures are found to show real Iraqis, the soldiers involved would be in breach of the Geneva Convention which governs the treatment of prisoners of war. <br><br>The convention demands that prisoners are treated humanely and not subject to degrading treatment. <br><br><br><br>He went out to Iraq for his country and we are proud of him <br>The soldier's father <br>The mother of the soldier spoke to reporters from the upstairs window of the shop she runs with her husband in a Warwickshire village. <br><br>She told reporters: "He does not belong to us any more. <br><br>"The Army is his mother. It's the Army which looks after him. <br><br>"We have not been able to contact him and we know nothing about what's happened to him, so we're saying nothing." <br><br>But the soldier's father, who also cannot be named, said he supports the 18-year-old: "Of course we are proud of our son. <br><br>"He went out to Iraq for his country and we are proud of him." <br><br><br>THIRD GENEVA CONVENTION <br>Many rules about the treatment of POWs including: <br>Basic food rations should keep prisoners in good health <br>Suitable clothing should be supplied, preferably prisoners' original uniforms <br>Prisoners must be protected against violence or intimidation, insults and public curiosity <br>They should be released and repatriated after ceasefire <br><br><br>A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said an investigation into the allegations was under way. <br>"If there is any truth in these allegations the MoD is appalled. We take responsibility to POWs extremely seriously," she said. <br><br>The alleged ill-treatment of Iraqi prisoners by coalition forces is already being investigated by human rights group Amnesty International. <br><br>It welcomed the inquiry into the photos, and warned that the allegations must not be "swept under the carpet". <br><br>The pictures are believed to have been taken by a soldier serving in the 1st battalion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers - part of the 7th Armoured Brigade, nicknamed the Desert Rats. <br><br>Colonel Bob Stewart, former army officer, said: "If someone has done this then it devalues the British Army which is a great pity. <br><br>"That's why the British Army understands that if there's an accusation it must be rigorously pursued and proved either guilty or not guilty." <br><br><br>Story from BBC NEWS:<br><A HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/1/hi/england/2951888.stm"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/1/hi/england/2951888.stm></A><br><br>Published: 2003/05/31 10:38:32 GMT<br><br>Â© BBC MMIII<br><br><br>
