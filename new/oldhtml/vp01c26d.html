The Washington Times<br><A HREF="http://www.washingtontimes.com/"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=www.washingtontimes.com></A><br><br><br>Army's civil-affairs units stretched thin<br>By Rowan Scarborough<br>THE WASHINGTON TIMES<br>Published January 15, 2004<br><br>The ongoing rotation of new ground forces into Iraq this year will leave the military with fewer civil-affairs soldiers the personnel who fix schools, buy textbooks, provide electric generators and build housing. <br>   <br>Most civil-affairs soldiers are members of the Army Reserve. Planners are finding there are not sufficient numbers left in reserve to replace the ones going off active duty after one-year stints in Afghanistan and Iraq. <br><br>Brig. Gen. David N. Blackledge, chief of the 352nd Civil Affairs Command, told reporters yesterday in Baghdad that "unfortunately" more than 80 percent of all civil-affairs forces have been activated for those two countries since the war on terrorism began after the September 11 attacks. <br><br>"We´re running out of civil-affairs experts," Gen. Blackledge said. <br><br>The shortage means this: When the current 1,600 civil-affairs soldiers leave Iraq, they will be replaced by 70 percent of that force, or 1,120 troops. <br><br>Gen. Blackledge said that while all regions of Iraq will still be covered by his troops, some communities that now have civil-affairs troops will no longer host them. <br><br>"There´s been a high demand for civil-affairs experts and many of the folks that will be coming here for this next rotation will have already spent a year in Afghanistan," he said. "But what you can be assured is that a particular civil-affairs team may not be replaced in a particular location, but that area will be covered by civil-affairs forces that will be coming in and be responsible for that area." <br><br>In the war on terrorism, where winning the hearts and minds of the citizenry is crucial, Army civil-affairs forces have taken on added importance. After the fighting subsides, these experts go into communities to work with local leaders to improve the infrastructure and civil functions. <br><br>While it is the job of the Army Corps of Engineers to do big projects, such as electrical grids, the civil-affairs units focus on programs close to the community, such as repairing schoolhouses, restoring drinking water and building shelters for the homeless. <br><br>Yet, most of these experts reside in the reserve force because their special skills, such as engineering, the practice of law and teaching, are not required in large numbers in peacetime. <br><br>Now that the country is in a long war, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld may change that approach. He is looking at reshuffling the reserve-vs.-active-duty mix. Some specialties, such as military police and civil affairs, may be converted into active-duty units. <br><br>Gen. Blackledge´s troops have done most of their work in Iraq through the Commander´s Emergency Response Program (CERP). While the Coalition Provisional Authority has a new reconstruction fund of $18.7 billion, CERP works with a much smaller pot, $29 million to date. <br><br>The general listed some of his troops´ successes: <br>Nearly 6 million students now attend school, aided by 51 million new textbooks free of Saddam Hussein propaganda. <br>Nearly 100,000 Iraqis have applied to college via the Ministry of Education, compared with 63,000 last year. <br>In northern Iraq, soldiers built a village called Project Hope for the homeless. <br>A brick factory in the troubled city of Fallujah was reopened, thanks to an Army-supplied electrical generator, putting 800 Iraqis back to work. <br><br>The Pentagon last week kicked off a massive rotation of forces that will withdraw 130,000 ground troops from Iraq and replace them with the about the same number of soldiers and Marines by late spring. <br><br><br>
