Disapproval was strongest in Argentina and France, while people in Nigeria, Kenya and the Philippines were more likely to approve. <br><br>Detainees in Guantanamo: 67% disapproved (50% in the US). Backing for America on this issue was highest in Nigeria, where 49% approved. <br><br>Israeli-Hezbollah war: Washington's role met with approval from respondents in Nigeria and Philippines, but on average 65% disapproved across the 25 countries (50% in the US). <br><br>Iran's nuclear programme: again, support for US actions appeared strongest in Kenya (62%), Nigeria (53%) and the Philippines (52%). But, overall 60% of respondents disapproved (50% in the US). <br><br>Global warming: more than 80% of respondents in Argentina, France and Germany disapproved compared to 56% overall (54% in the US). But the White House had 50% or more support among those polled in Nigeria, Kenya, the Philippines and South Korea. <br><br>North Korea's nuclear programme: opposition to US policy was strongest among respondents in Argentina and Brazil. On average across the 25 countries 54% disapproved (43% in the US). <br>When asked about US military presence in the Middle East, an average of 68% of respondents across the 25 countries answered that it "provokes more conflict than it prevents". <br><br><br> SEE THE FULL SURVEY <br><br>Most computers will open this document automatically, but you may need Adobe Reader <br> <br><br>In Nigeria, 49% of respondents said it was a "stabilising force", as did 41% in the Philippines, 40% in Kenya and 33% in the US. <br><br>The poll was conducted for the BBC World Service by GlobeScan and the Program on International Policy Attitudes (Pipa) at the University of Maryland. It has a margin of error ranging from +/-2.5% to +/-4%. <br><br>The questions were put to people in: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, China, Egypt, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Italy, Kenya, Lebanon, Mexico, Nigeria, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, South Korea, Turkey, United Arab Emirates and the United States. <br><br><br>Story from BBC NEWS:<br><A HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/americas/6286755.stm"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/americas/6286755.stm></A><br><br>Published: 2007/01/23 00:16:47 GMT<br><br><br>
