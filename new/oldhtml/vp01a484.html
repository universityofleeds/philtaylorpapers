Yet it clearly has its uses. <br><br>For in a country where watching TV or surfing the internet is banned, the Taleban has used al-Jazeera as one way of communicating with the world. <br><br>Taleban Foreign Ministry officials have spoken via satellite link to the al-Jazeera headquarters in the Gulf state of Qatar. <br><br>Exclusives <br><br>The station has scored numerous exclusives. It broadcast the only video pictures of Afghan demonstrators attacking and setting fire to the US embassy on 26 September. <br><br>And it grabbed international headlines again a few days later with a report that three US special forces troops and two Afghan US citizens had been captured by Bin Laden's al-Qaeda group near the border with Iran. <br><br>Despite a Taleban denial, al-Jazeera stood by its report, saying that a member of al-Qaeda had called its bureau in Pakistan to announce the capture. <br><br>Al-Jazeera prides itself on reporting on the Middle East from an Arab perspective while drawing on the professional experience of staff who have worked in the Western media. <br><br>It has consistently topped viewer ratings in the Middle East and claims 35m viewers. <br><br>Funding <br><br>Since its launch in 1996, the channel has relied on funding from the Qatari emirate, advertising and viewer revenue and deals with other broadcasters. It recently signed a deal to broadcast on Sky Digital to the UK and Europe. <br><br>The channel's popularity stems from its news coverage and lively talk shows on sensitive political, social and even sexual issues. <br><br> <br>The channel says its guiding principles are "diversity of viewpoints and real-time news coverage" <br> <br><br>Al-Jazeera's journalistic scoops have turned the spotlight on the channel. There has been talk of privatisation, but if such a move proceeds, the station could face pressure from commercial sponsors in the Gulf, from where there has often been criticism of its output. <br><br>However, although state subsidies are expected to end next month, analysts predict that Qatar will continue bankrolling the channel as its controversial reporting could scare off advertisers or shareholders. <br><br>Despite its independent stance, al-Jazeera has been labelled by some UK newspapers as a "mouthpiece" of Osama Bin Laden and al-Qaeda, and US officials have expressed concern at what it sees as the anti-Western tone of much of its reporting. <br><br><br><br>
