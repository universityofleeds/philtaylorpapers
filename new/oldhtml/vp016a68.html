Download full text.<br><br>The report distills a massive amount of data into side-by-side comparisons of pre-war intelligence, the official presentation of that intelligence, and what is now known about Iraq's programs.<br><br>The authors of the report are: Jessica T. Mathews, president; George Perkovich, vice president for studies, and Joseph Cirincione, senior associate and non-proliferation project director of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. <br><br>SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS<br>Changes to U.S. Policy <br>· Revise the National Security Strategy to eliminate a U.S. policy of unilateral preventive war, i.e., preemptive war in absence of imminent threat.<br>· Create a nonpartisan, independent commission to establish a clearer picture of what the intelligence community knew and believed it knew about Iraq's weapons program.<br>· Consider changing the post of Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) from a political appointment to a career appointment, based on the outcomes of the independent commission.<br>· Make the security of poorly protected nuclear weapons and stockpiles of plutonium and highly enriched uranium a much higher priority for national security policy. <br><br>International Action<br>· The United States and United Nations should together produce a complete history and inventory of Iraq's WMD and missile programs. <br>· The UN Secretary General should commission a high-level analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the WMD inspection processes in Iraq, and how inspections could be strengthened in the future. <br>· The UN Security Council should consider creating a permanent, international, nonproliferation inspection capability. <br>· Make the transfer of WMD a violation of international law.<br><br>Changes to Threat Assessments <br>· Recognize distinctions in the degree of threat posed by the different forms of "weapons of mass destruction" - chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons pose vastly different risks and cost-benefit calculations of actions to combat them. <br>· Recognize red flags indicating that sound intelligence practices are not being followed. <br>· Examine and debate the assertion that the combined threat of evil states and terrorism calls for acting on the basis of worst-case reasoning. <br>· Examine assumption that states will likely transfer WMD to terrorists.<br><br>SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS<br><br>Iraq WMD Was Not An Immediate Threat<br>· Iraq's nuclear program had been suspended for many years; Iraq focused on preserving a latent, dual-use chemical and probably biological weapons capability, not weapons production.<br>· Iraqi nerve agents had lost most of their lethality as early as 1991. <br>· Operations Desert Storm and Desert Fox, and UN inspections and sanctions effectively destroyed Iraq's large-scale chemical weapon production capabilities.<br><br>Inspections Were Working<br>· Post-war searches suggest the UN inspections were on track to find what was there. <br>· International constraints, sanctions, procurement, investigations, and the export/import control mechanism appear to have been considerably more effective than was thought.<br><br>Intelligence Failed and Was Misrepresented<br>· Intelligence community overestimated the chemical and biological weapons in Iraq.<br>· Intelligence community appears to have been unduly influenced by policymakers' views. <br>· Officials misrepresented threat from Iraq's WMD and ballistic missiles programs over and above intelligence findings.<br><br>Terrorist Connection Missing<br>· No solid evidence of cooperative relationship between Saddam's government and Al Qaeda. <br>· No evidence that Iraq would have transferred WMD to terrorists-and much evidence to counter it. <br>· No evidence to suggest that deterrence was no longer operable.<br><br>Post-War WMD Search Ignored Key Resources<br>· Past relationships with Iraqi scientists and officials, and credibility of UNMOVIC experts represent a vital resource that has been ignored when it should be being fully exploited. <br>· Data from the seven years of UNSCOM/IAEA inspections are absolutely essential. Direct involvement of those who compiled the more-than-30-million- page record is needed.<br><br>War Was Not the Best-Or Only-Option<br>· There were at least two options preferable to a war undertaken without international support: allowing the UNMOVIC/IAEA inspections to continue until obstructed or completed, or imposing a tougher program of "coercive inspections." <br><br><br><br>
