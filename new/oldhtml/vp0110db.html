Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) that are contained in legislation to implement the 9-11 Commission recommendations.<br><br>The Hyde provisions, which also include measures to improve U.S. diplomacy, are part of broad legislation introduced by the House Republican leadership on Friday in response to findings announced in July by the 9-11 Commission. The omnibus legislation is expected to be voted on in early October.<br><br>"Today, we are more aware than ever of the importance of ensuring security for America and her citizens. The nation was unprepared for the attacks of Sept. 11. That cannot be allowed to happen again," said Hyde, chairman of the House International Relations Committee. <br><br>"In light of the excellent report produced by the 9-11 Commission, it is evident that we must act to guarantee America's safety, and eradicating U.S. visa and passport fraud is essential to this effort," he added.<br><br>The 9-11 Commission reported that the hijackers who carried out the September 11, 2001 attacks used fraudulent travel documents to gain access into the United States. In response to this information, the Hyde proposal includes new penalties for the possession and transfer of unlawful visas and passports. His proposal also includes provisions for the establishment of an Office of Visa and Passport Security within the Department of State to target and prosecute those who are involved in document fraud.<br><br>The Hyde bill includes a study on implementation of a full- scale entry-exit passenger screening system at all U.S. ports of entry. It also urges the President to lobby for international travel document standards, including standards for translation of names into the Roman alphabet for accurate, more efficient identification of travelers.<br><br>"The changes outlined here are timely and necessary, but we also must look to the future. For this reason, this proposal requires a feasibility study of the use of biometric, tamper- resistant, machine-readable passports and creation of a worldwide traveler history database so that we can better track those who may pose a potential threat to our Nation," said Hyde.<br><br>Included in Hyde's proposal is an increase in the number of airports worldwide, from 14 to 39, that pre-screen travel documents of passengers bound for the United States. In addition, the Immigration Security Initiative, designed to aid airport personnel in identifying fraudulent documents and assessing potential threats, will be expanded to include 50 airports worldwide.<br><br>Over the next five years, the proposal mandates 600 additional consular officers at U.S. embassies abroad to help monitor nonimmigrant visa applicants. Along with these additional consular officers, antifraud specialists will be assigned to the 100 embassies and consulates which have reported the greatest occurrences of travel document fraud.<br><br>"America has already seen what can happen at the hands of terrorists," said Hyde. "We must be proactive in the establishment of more strict security measures and be pioneers in the research of future technologies to ensure that the United States is a safer place for all of us and for the next generation of Americans."<br><br>-- 9-11 Commission Report Findings and Proposed Implementing Legislation within the Jurisdiction of the House International Relations Committee --<br><br>-- Proposal authored by Chairman Hyde addresses specific legislative provisions outlined by the 9-11 Commission to improve the Nation's ability to deal with the threat of terrorism in the 21st Century -- <br><br>Curbs use of bogus U.S. visas and passports <br><br>-- Establishes new criminal penalties for possession and transfer of fraudulent visas and passports.<br><br>-- Establishes an Office of Visa and Passport Security within the Department of State to develop and implement a strategic plan targeting those involved in document fraud.<br><br>-- Expands the Immigration Security Initiative to include 50 airports worldwide to assist more airline personnel in identifying fraudulent travel documents. <br><br>-- Requires full implementation of an Entry-Exit System at U.S. ports of entry.<br><br>-- Urges the President to lobby for improved international standards for translation of names into the Roman alphabet for international travel documents and name-based watch lists. <br><br>-- Requires a feasibility study on the introduction of biometric, tamper-resistant machine-readable passports and travel history database.<br><br>-- Expands from 14 to 39 the number of airports worldwide now undertaking pre-inspection of U.S.-bound passengers.<br><br>-- Requires an addition of 600 consular officers at U.S. embassies worldwide by 2009; limits use of foreign nationals to screen nonimmigrant visa applicants at U.S. embassies and consulates.<br><br>-- Requires the assignment of antifraud specialists to the 100 embassies and consulates worldwide with the greatest incidences of fraud. <br><br>-- Identifies and halts the growth of terrorist sanctuaries. <br><br>-- Amends the Export Administration Act to regulate trade in dual-use technology with nations that tolerate terrorist sanctuaries.<br><br>-- Encourages the development of an International Terrorism Interdiction Initiative to secure multilateral support for attacks on terrorists.<br><br>Tightens U.S. law to prevent proliferation of weapons technologies worldwide<br><br>-- Mandates a review of U.S. nonproliferation policies by independent, nongovernmental experts to identify gaps, ineffective measures, and unexploited opportunities for the development of remedial policies.<br><br>Reinvigorates U.S. diplomacy, particularly ongoing efforts to reach out to a broader worldwide population, to explain and defend U.S. foreign policy <br><br>-- Requires the Secretary of State to develop annually a public diplomacy strategy and to evaluate the effectiveness of its efforts to explain U.S. policies to foreign audiences. <br><br>-- Requires Foreign Service officers to accept a tour of duty in a public diplomacy position as a condition for promotion into the senior ranks of the Department.<br><br>-- Requires the State Department to seek individuals with applicable public relations and language skills to enhance the Department's public diplomacy capabilities.<br><br>-- Provides grants to American-sponsored schools in Arab and other predominantly Muslim countries.<br><br>-- Requires the State Department to include the promotion of free press and development of professional journalists in the U.S. public diplomacy program strategy.<br><br>-- Requires additional efforts against biased or false foreign media coverage of the United States. <br><br>Builds ties to key Muslim states <br><br>-- Makes our assistance program for Afghanistan more effective, and urges greater coordination among agencies of the U.S. Government and allies to tackle the growing problem of narcotics, a major source of terrorist financing and political instability.<br><br>-- Enables additional support to be provided to Pakistan.<br><br>-- Requires a strategy to be implemented which will reverse the trend toward extremism in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the Middle East. <br><br><A HREF="http://www.usnewswire.com/"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=http://www.usnewswire.com/></A><br><br><br><br>
