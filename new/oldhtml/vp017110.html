It broadcasts on terrestrial airwaves to Iraq, as well as via satellite.<br><br> <br> The purpose of the channel is to present the viewpoints of the Islamic world and counter the monopolisation of news channels by western countries <br><br>Hasan Beheshtipur<br>Al-Alam's managing director  <br><br><br><br>The transmissions are believed to be broadcast from a TV relay station on high ground in Iran overlooking parts of Iraq.<br><br>There are reports from Baghdad that sales of aerials have soared in the capital - and that might boost the popularity of Al-Alam. Satellite dishes are banned in Iraq.<br><br>The station is also available on the internet and can be received in the Middle East, Europe, Asia-Pacific and America.<br><br>Al-Jazeera lookalike<br><br>A BBC Monitoring media analyst has noted a similarity between Al-Alam's format and that of the Qatar-based Al-Jazeera satellite TV. <br><br>An "Exclusive Al-Alam" caption comes up when the station shows its own reports and their logo Al-Alam in Arabic script appears on the right-hand side of the screen.<br><br>The station broadcasts in Arabic with a news ticker in English updating the news on the war from international news agency reports.<br><br>Al-Alam's managing director Hasan Beheshtipur has said that the purpose of the channel is to present the viewpoints of the Islamic world and "counter the monopolisation of news channels by western countries".<br><br>He said "the network plans to fill the existing vacuum in news dissemination in today's world".<br><br>BBC Monitoring, based in Caversham in southern England, selects and translates information from radio, television, press, news agencies and the Internet from 150 countries in more than 70 languages.<br><br> <br><br><br>
