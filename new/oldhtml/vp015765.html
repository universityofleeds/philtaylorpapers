He was bundled up in netting suspended from the fork-lift which was driven by a British soldier, said the best-selling tabloid.<br><br>It is believed the prisoner was alive when the pictures were taken in southern Iraq as the aggression was running, said the British paper.<br><br>The MoD confirmed that a soldier was being held in military custody while the Special Investigations Branch of the Royal Military Police launched an inquiry, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported.<br><br>"We confirm an investigation is under way into allegations of photos depicting maltreatment of Iraqi PoWs," a ministry spokeswoman said.<br><br>If the pictures are found to show real Iraqis, and have not been stage-managed, such treatment would be a breach of the Geneva Convention which governs the treatment of POWs, she admitted.<br><br>"We cannot comment further. But if there is any truth in these allegations the MoD is appalled. We take responsibility to PoWs extremely seriously."<br><br>The MoD refused to confirm the soldiers' identity, unit or hometown.<br><br>But the BBC News Online said the pictures are believed to have been taken by a soldier serving with the 1st Royal Regiment of Fusiliers in southern Iraq at the time of the events.<br><br>The Sun said the soldier was arrested by civilian police at his home in the English Midlands, where he was on leave following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.<br><br>Britain contributed 45,000 military personnel, a naval task force and more than 100 aircraft to the war, and British forces currently occupy the southern part of Iraq.<br><br>An investigation is already underway into charges that a colonel in the Royal Irish Regiment, Tim Collins, abused Iraqi PoWs and civilians.<br><br>The charges were made by a U.S. army reservist tongue-lashed by Collins for handing out lollipops to Iraqi children.<br><br>The 1st battalion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers -- part of the 7th Armoured Brigade, nicknamed the Desert Rats -- is based in Celle, Germany.<br><br>The Fusiliers were also involved in Gulf War I in 1991 - and lost nine men when American jets strafed their armoured personnel carriers.<br><br>Cluster Bombs Used<br><br>The investigations into torturing Iraqi PoWs come as British Defense Minister Adam Ingram admitted that the Anglo-American forces did use cluster bombs in densely populated areas during the Iraq invasion.<br><br>Seventy-five Labor MPs are calling for cluster bombs, which can leave unexploded "bomblets", to be banned because of the threat they pose to civilians, the BBC News Online reported.<br><br>British Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon on April 3 told lawmakers that cluster bombs were used only when it was "absolutely justified" because it would "make the battlefield safer for our armed forces". <br><br><br>
