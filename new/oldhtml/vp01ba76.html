Thank you very much for going to all this trouble on a Sunday morning to come and join us. I suppose you are watching with a mixture of emotions this war beginning to happen, because you are not going to be covering it."  <br>Kate Adie:<br>  " Oh I will be. And what actually appalls me is the difference between twelve years ago and now. I've seen a complete erosion of any kind of acknowledgment that reporters should be able to report as they witness."<br><br>" The Americans... and I've been talking to the Pentagon ...take the attitude which is entirely hostile to the free spread of information." <br><br>" I was told by a senior officer in the Pentagon, that if uplinks --that is the television signals out of... Bhagdad, for example-- were detected by any planes ...electronic media... mediums, of the military above Bhagdad... they'd be fired down on. Even if they were journalists ..' Who cares! ' said.. [inaudible] .." <br>Tom McGurk: "...Kate ...sorry Kate ..just to underline that. Sorry to interrupt you. Just to explain for our listeners. Uplinks is where you have your own satellite telephone method of distributing information." <br>Kate Adie: " The telephones and the television signals." <br>Tom McGurk: " And they would be fired on? "  <br>Kate Adie: " Yes. They would be 'targeted down,' <br>said the officer."  <br>Tom McGurk: " Extraordinary ! "  <br><br><br>Listen full Gulf Media Freedom segment Audio<br><br>26 minutes[ Realplayer] <br><br> Kate Adie: " Shameless! " <br><br>He said: <br>' Well... they know this ...<br>they've been warned.' <br><br>This is threatening freedom of information, before you even get to a war.<br><br>The second thing is there was a massive news blackout imposed.<br><br>In the last Gulf war, where I was one of the pool correspondents with the British Army. We effectively had very, very light touch when it came to any kind of censorship.<br><br>We were told that anything which was going to endanger troops lives which we understood we shouldn't broadcast. But other than that, we were relatively free.<br><br>Unlike our American colleagues, who immediately left their pool, after about 48 hours, having just had enough of it.<br><br>And this time the Americans are: a) Asking journalists who go with them, whether they are... have feelings against the war. And therefore if you have views that are skeptical, then you are not to be acceptable.<br><br>Secondly, they are intending to take control of the Americans technical equipment ...those uplinks and satellite phones I was talking about. And control access to the airwaves.<br><br>And then on top of everything else, there is now a blackout (which was imposed, during the last war, at the beginning of the war), ...ordered by one Mr. Dick Cheney, who is in charge of this.<br><br>I am enormously pessimistic of the chance of decent on-the-spot reporting, as the war occurs. You will get it later.<br> <br><br><br>
