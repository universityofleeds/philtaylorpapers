WMR's State Department sources report that the recent transfer of David Denehy from his job as Senior Adviser to the Assistant Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy Karen Hughes to the Office of the Vice President is another sign that the Bush administration is gearing up to attack Iran. Denehy also headed up the State Department's new Office of Iran Affairs, which was carved out of the Office of Arabian Peninsular Affairs for the sole purpose of creating the environment for a U.S. military attack on Iran. Denehy coordinated his activities with Farsi-speaking Iran Affairs Office personnel in Europe and Dubai, Iranian expatriates in Europe and Washington, DC, as well as with U.S. and Israeli intelligence officers.<br><br>Denehy, who once worked for the International Republican Institute (IRI) and is a committed neo-con, was closely associated with the Iraq invasion. Denehy's promotional climb at State was quick. He joined the department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research as an Iraq and Iran intern-analyst shortly after George W. Bush's inauguration in 2001. In 2003, Denehy was promoted to be Jerry Bremer's Deputy Director of Democracy and Governance in the Coalition Provisional Authority. In 2004, he became Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor and was again promoted to be Director of the Office of Strategic and External Affairs -- a State Department version of the Pentagon's Office of Special Plans. Denehy was a close associate of Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Elizabeth Cheney, the daughter of Vice President Cheney.<br><br>
