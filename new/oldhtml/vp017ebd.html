I can be silent no longer. All day long you<br>     muttered to yourself, gibbered, dribbled, moaned and bat your head<br>     against the wall, yelling "I want to die". Now you may say I'm<br>     leaping to conclusions but you're not *completely* happy, are you?<br>     It's mother, isn't it?<br>F:   No, it is not.<br>K:   You're brooding over her death, aren't you?<br>F:   Kate, for the final time, your mother is not dead. She's run off<br>     with your uncle Henry.<br>K:   Dear father, I know you only say such things to comfort me.<br>F:   Your mother is alive and well and living in Droitwich. It is not her<br>     I brood over. I'm sad because, my darling, our poverty has now<br>     reached such extremes that I can no longer afford to keep us. I must<br>     look to my own dear tiny darling to sustain me in my frail dotage.<br>K:   But father, surely...<br>F:   Yes Kate, I want you to become a prostitute.<br>K:   Father!<br>F:   Do you defy me?<br>K:   But indeed, I do. For it is better to die poor than to live in shame<br>     and ignominy.<br>F:   No, it isn't.<br>K:   I'm young and strong and clever. My nose is pretty. I shall find<br>     another way to earn us a living.<br>F:   Oh, please... go on the game. It is a steady job and you'd be<br>     working from home.<br>K:   Goodbye father. I shall go to London, disguise my self as a boy and<br>     seek my fortune!<br>F:   But why go all the way to London when you can make a  fortune lying<br>     on your back?<br><br>In the house of Edmund Blackadder.<br>[Baldrick holds a dartboard over his head, while Edmund practises the bow]<br>B:   Ah, very good shot, my lord.<br>E:   Thank you, Baldrick.<br>[Percy walks in]<br>S:   Sorry I'm late.<br>E:   No, don't bother apologizing. I'm sorry you're alive.<br>S:   Oh good, I see the target is ready. [Picks up the bow]<br>     I'd like to see the Spaniard who could make his way past me.<br>E:   Well, go to Spain. There're millions of them.<br>S:   I'll advise them to stay there then. Keep their hands off our women.<br>E:   Oh God, who is she this time?<br>S:   I don't know what you mean. Aah, ouch, aah.<br>[Edmund succeeds in pilfering a letter from Percy]<br>E:   Aah, and who is Jane?<br>S:   I'm sworn to secrecy. Torture me, kill me, you shall never know.<br>     Ooh, ouch... Jane Herrington.  We're very much in love, my lord.<br>E:   This is *the* Jane Herrington?<br>S:   Yes.<br>E:   Jane - burry-me-in-a-wide-shaped-coffin - Herrington.<br>S:   I.., I think maybe there are two Jane Herringtons.   <br>E:   No... Tall, blond, elegant?<br>S:   Right, that's right.<br>E:   Goes like a privy door when the plague is in town?<br>     Come on, get on with your shot. You'll get over her.<br>... [Percy aims]<br>E:   I did.<br>... [Percy aims again]<br>E:   So did Baldrick actually. [Percy's shot ends up way too low]<br>S:   Damned!<br>E:   You see, she's got this thing about beards apparently.<br>S:   Well, in that case I'm going to shave!<br>[Percy leaves]<br>E:   Bad luck, Boulders.<br>B:   Not to worry my lord, the arrow didn't in fact enter my body.<br>E:   Oh good.<br>E:   No, by a thousand to one chance my willy got in the way.<br>E:   Extraordinary.<br>B:   And I only just put it there. But now, I will leave it there<br>     forever.<br>E:   That so Baldrick? It can be your lucky willy.     <br>B:   Yes, my lord. Years from now I'll show it to my grandchildren.<br>E:   No Baldrick, I think that grandchildren may now be out of the<br>     question.<br>     Poor old Pee Brain, eh? Ha! Never catch me falling in love, that's<br>     for damned sure as mustard[?]. <br>[Knock on the door]<br>E:   Come in.<br>[Kate enters, dressed in boys clothes]<br>b:   Good day to you, Lord Blackadder!<br>E:   Ah, good day to you... boy?!. What is it brings you here?<br>b:   I'm an honest hard working lad, but poor and I must support my<br>     father who is stark raving mad. Therefore I come to London to seek a<br>     servants wage.<br>E:   Yes, indeed. Unfortunately I already have a servant.<br>b:   The word is that your servant is the worst servant in London.<br>E:   Hmm, that's true. Baldrick you're fired. Be out of the house in ten<br>     minutes. Well young man you've got your self a job. What do they<br>     call you?<br>b:   Kate.<br>E:   Isn't that a bit of a girls name?<br>b:   Oh..it's..euh... short for... Bob!<br>E:   Bob?!<br>b:   Yes.<br>E:   Well, Bob, welcome on board.<br>     Sorry Baldrick, any reason why you are still here?<br>B:   Euh .. I've got nowhere to go, my lord.<br>E:   O surely you will be allowed to starve to death in one of the royal<br>     parks.<br>B:   I've been in your service since I was two and a halve, my lord.<br>E:   Well that is the why I am so utterly sick of the sight of you.<br>B:   Couldn't I just stay here and do the same job but for no wages?<br>E:   Well, you know where you will have to live.<br>B:   In the gutter.<br>B:   Yes.<br>E:   And you'll have to work a bit harder too.<br>B:   Of course, my lord.<br>E:   All right. Go and get Bob's stuff in and chuck your filthy muck out<br>     into the street.<br>B:   God bless you, sweet master.<br>[Baldrick leaves, Percy enters again, without beard]<br>E:   Oh Bob, this is Percy, a dimwit I don't seem to be able to shake<br>     off.<br>S:   Ah, hello there Bob, you young roister-doister, you. Ah, you look a<br>     likely sort of lad for tricks and sports and all sorts of jolly,<br>     rosy cheap capering, eh. Of course you do, and more besides, I<br>     warrant thee, young scamp.<br>b:   Thank you so much for letting me stay Lord Blackadder.<br>E:   Oh not at all Bob. I'm looking forward to having you... Euh, having<br>     another man about the house instead of that animal Baldrick. Excuse<br>     me, I must go into the lavatory.<br>b:   [to the camera] How little he knows and how much I would have him<br>     know.<br>S:   I say Bob, I think this calls for a celebration. How about a game of<br>     cup and ball and a slab of tea at Mrs. Miggins pie shop?<br>b:   Get lost, creep!<br>S:   Euh, euh, I like you young Bob. You've got balls.<br><br><br>In the court of Queen Elizabeth.<br><br>Q:   Nice try Melchy, but it is no use. I'm still bored!<br>M:   I'm very sorry madam. Your royal father used to be very amused by my<br>     impersonation of Columbus.<br>Q:   You don't surprise me. He used to laugh at these people with the<br>     funny faces and the bells.<br>M:   Ah, jesters ma'm.<br>Q:   No, lepers. Where is Edmund these days?<br>M:   Ah well, the whisper on the underground grapevine, ma'm, is that<br>     Lord Blackadder is spending all his time with a young boy in his<br>     service.<br>Q:   Oh. Do you think he would spend more time with me if I was a boy?<br>M:   Surely not madam.<br>N:   You almost were a boy, my little cherrypit.<br>Q:   What?<br>N:   Yeah. Out you popped, out of your mummies pumpkin and everybody<br>     shouting : "It's a boy, it's a boy!". And somebody said "but it<br>     hasn't got a winkle!". And then I said "A boy without a winkle? God<br>     be praised, it is a miracle. A boy without a winkle!" And then Sir<br>     Thomas More pointed out that a boy without a winkle is a girl.<br>     Anyway, I was really disappointed.<br>M:   Oh yes, well you see, he was a very perceptive man, Sir Thomas More.<br>Q:   Oh, what *has* happened about Edmund? There is something very odd<br>     about someone who spends all his time with a servant.<br><br>[Romantic interlude with Edmund and Bob walking in the countryside to the<br>tunes of "Greensleeves", "The Rain it Raineth Every Day", "Hey Nonny, I<br>Love You", "My Love is a Prick (On a Tudor Rose)", "Hot Sex Madrigal in the<br>Middle of my Tights" and "Many, many more..."] <br><br>E:   Well Bob. We're a couple of fine lads together, aren't we? Let's get<br>     retted and talk about girls eh? Yes we could sink to really dirty<br>     songs and... oh God, I find you curiously pleasant company, young<br>     Bob.<br>b:   I'm honoured and for my part want nothing more than to be with<br>     you... old man.<br>E:   Well absolutely. I mean there is nothing more healthy and normal<br>     than having a good chum.<br>b:   What think you my lord of love?<br>E:   You mean rumpy pumpy?<br>b:   What would you say my lord if I were to say "I love you".<br>E:   Eum, well of course it depends entirely on whom you said it to. If<br>     you said it to a horse I would presume you were sick, if you said it<br>     to Baldrick I would presume you were blind and if you said it to me,<br>     well...<br>b:   Yes, my lord?<br>E:   Well, well I'd naturally assume we were having a big lads joke about<br>     back-tickle as the way we healthy fellows often do and I'd probably<br>     grab you for a friendly wrestle and then we'd probably slap each<br>     others sides like jolly good chums and laugh at what it would be<br>     like if we really did fancy each other.<br>b:   In that case my lord... I love you!<br>[Bob and Edmund engage in friendly wrestling, just when the mood changes,<br>Baldrick enters the room]<br>B:   Don't worry Bob. He used to try and kill me too.<br>E:   Why didn't you go Baldrick? Mighty glad to see you[?] What do you<br>     want?<br>B:   Bah, I was wondering if I might sleep on the roof sir? Earlier the<br>     towns bailiff says that if I lie in the gutter I will be flushed<br>     into the Thames with all the other turds.<br>E:   Yes, certainly Baldrick. Help your self. I was just off to bed<br>     anyway. Euh.. good night Baldrick. Good night Bob.<br>b:   Good night my lord.<br>E:   Yes. Oh God...<br><br><br>At the doctors.<br><br>D:   Now then what seems to be the trouble?<br>E:   Well, it is my man servant.<br>D:   I see. Well don't be embarrassed if you got the pocks. Just pop your<br>     man servant on the table and we'll take a look at him.<br>E:   No, I mean, it is my real man servant.<br>D:   Ah, ah. And what is wrong with him?<br>E:   There is nothing wrong with him. That is the problem. He's perfect<br>     and last night I almost kissed him.<br>D:   I see. So you started fancying boys then, have you?<br>E:   Not boys. A boy.<br>D:   Yes, well let's not split hairs. It is all rather disgusting and<br>     naturally you're worried.<br>E:   Of course I'm worried.<br>D:   Well, of course you are. It isn't every day a man wakes up to<br>     discover he's a screaming bender with no more right to live on Gods<br>     clean earth than a weazle. Ashamed of your self?<br>E:   Not really, no.<br>D:   Bloody hell! I would be. But still why should I complain? Just<br>     leaves more rampant totty for us real men, eh?<br>E:   Look, am I paying for this personal abuse or is it extra?<br>D:   No, it's all part of the service. I think you're in luck though. An<br>     extraordinary new cure has just been developed for exactly this kind<br>     of sordid problem.<br>E:   It wouldn't have anything to do with leeches, would it?<br>D:   I had no idea you were a medical man.<br>E:   Never had anything you doctors didn't try to cure with leeches. A<br>     leech on my ear for ear ache, a leech on my bottom for constipation.<br>D:   They're marvellous, aren't they?<br>E:   Well, the bottom one wasn't. I just sat there and squashed it.<br>D:   You know the leech comes to us on the highest authority?<br>E:   Yes. I know that. Dr. Hoffmann of Stuttgart, isn't it?<br>D:   That's right, the great Hoffmann.<br>E:   Owner of the largest leech farm of Europe.<br>D:   Yes. Well, I cannot spend all day gossiping. I'm a busy man. As far<br>     as this case is concerned I have now had time to think it over and I<br>     can strongly recommend a course of leeches. [in chorus]<br>E:   Yes. I 'll pop a couple down my codpiece before I go to bed.<br>D:   No, no, no, no. Don't be ridiculous. This isn't the dark ages. Just<br>     pop four in your mouth in the morning and let them dissolve slowly.<br>     In a couple of weeks you 'll be beating your servant with a stick,<br>     just like the rest of us.<br>E:   You're a sale[?] quack, aren't you?<br>D:   I'd rather be a quack than a ducky. Good day.<br><br><br>At the house of lord Blackadder.<br><br>B:   Anything to follow my lord? There is this lovely fat spider I found<br>     in the bath. I was saving it for my self but if you fancy it...<br>E:   Shut up Baldrick. I don't eat invertebrates for fun you know. This<br>     is doctors orders.<br>B:   Oh, I don't hold with this new fangle doctoring. Any  problems, I go<br>     to the Wise woman!<br>E:   Yes Baldrick. I am long past on trusting my self to some deranged<br>     druid who gives her professional address as 1, Dunghill Mansions,<br>     Putney.<br><br><br>In Putney.<br><br>E:   Tell me Young crone, is this Putney?<br>C:   That it be, that it be.<br>E:   "Yes it is". Not "that it be". You don't have to talk in that stupid<br>     voice to me. I'm not a tourist. I seek information about a<br>     Wisewoman.<br>C:   Ah, the Wisewoman.. the Wisewoman. <br>E:   Yes, the Wisewoman.<br>C:   Two things, my lord, must thee know of the Wisewoman. First, she is<br>     ... a woman, and second, she is ...<br>E:   .. wise?<br>C:   You do know her then?<br>E:   No, just a wild stab in the dark which is incidentally what you'll<br>     be getting if you don't start being a bit more helpful. Do you know<br>     where she lives?<br>C:   Of course.<br>E:   Where?<br>C:   Here. Do you have an appointment?<br>E:   No.<br>C:   Well, you can go in anyway.<br>E:   Thank you Young crone. Here is a purse of moneys... which I'm not<br>     going to give to you.<br><br>W:   Hail Edmund, lord of Adders Black.<br>E:   Hello.<br>W:   Step no nearer, for already I see thy bloody purpose. Thou plot is,<br>     Blackadder: thou wouldst be king and drown Middlesex in a butt of<br>     wine. Ah, ah, ah, ah.<br>E:   No, no, no, no. it is far worse than that. I'm in love with my man<br>     servant.<br>W:   Oh well, I'd sleep with him if I were you.<br>E:   What?<br>W:   When I fancy people, I sleep with them. Oh, I have to drug them<br>     first of course! Being so old and watty.<br>E:   But what about my position, my social life?<br>W:   Very well then. Three other paths are open to you. Three cunning<br>     plans to cure thy ailment.<br>E:   Oh good.<br>W:   The first is simple. Kill Bob!<br>E:   Never.<br>W:   Then try the second. Kill your self!<br>E:   Neu. And the third?<br>W:   The third is to ensure that no one else ever knows.<br>E:   Ha, that sounds more like it. How?<br>W:   Kill everybody in the whole world. Ah, ha, ha ...<br><br><br>At the house of Lord Blackadder.<br><br>E:   Now look here Bob. I've got something very important to say to you<br>     and I want you to listen very carefully.<br>b:   Yes.<br>E:   Look Bob. I've decided that you are to leave my service.<br>b:   Oh no, my lord! My father will starve and I'll have to become a..<br>     male prostitute. And besides, I thought we were friends.<br>E:   Oh we are friends Bob. Of course, of course.. In fact that's the<br>     reason I want you to leave my service and become my live-in[?] chum.<br>b:   Oh my lord!<br>E:   Now. I want to make definitely clear that I am in no way interested<br>     in the contents of your tights.<br>b:   You might be, my lord, if you knew what I kept in them.<br>E:   Euh, ah.. I've learned of my self, well.. that I know what a<br>     gentleman keeps in his tights. Thank you very much.<br>b:   But my lord, I have a great secret.<br>E:   What?<br>b:   Prepare to be amazed. [Bob starts unbuttoning her blouse]<br>E:   Oh no. You haven't got one of these birthmarks shaped like a banana,<br>     have you?<br>b:   No.<br>E:   Or, or, or a tattoo saying "Get it here"?<br>b:   No.<br>E:   Oh God. You've got one of those belly buttons that sticks outward,<br>     haven't you?<br>b:   No my lord.<br>E:   Now what can it possibly be?<br>[Mysterious music on a flute] <br>E:   Aah... good Lord!<br><br>[Two minutes later, Bob and Edmund chatting at the table]<br>E:   What was all that Bob's stuff about then?<br>b:   Because you would have just used me and cast me aside like you have<br>     so many women before.<br>E:   Would I?<br>b:   Yes. But now you have a chance to grow to love me for what I really<br>     am.<br>E:   Yes, that's true and now I want to marry you, Bob.<br>b:   Kate!<br>E:   Then come, kiss me Kate!<br><br><br>In the Court of Queen Elizabeth.<br><br>M:   I bring grave intelligence of your former favourite Lord Blackadder.<br>Q:   Oh good.<br>M:   It appears he wishes to marry a girl called Bob.<br>Q:   It is a very odd name for a girl, isn't it? Girls are normally<br>     called Elizabeth or Mary.<br>N:   And Donald...<br>Q:   Mouth is open Nursie, should be shut.<br>N:   Thing is true, sweet one. I had three sisters and they were called<br>     Donald, Eric and Basil.<br>Q:   Then why is your name Nursie?<br>N:   That ain't my real name.<br>Q:   Isn't it?<br>N:   No.<br>Q:   No, what is your real name then?<br>N:   Bernard.<br>Q:   Suites you, actually.<br>[Edmund enters the room]<br>E:   Your Majesty.<br>Q:   Oh, hello stranger.<br>E:   I seek your permission to wed.<br>Q:   So I hear. Melchie, what do you think of all this?<br>M:   Oh, but I must confess madam, that I'm astonished that Blackadder<br>     could possibly have eyes for any other woman than your self.<br>Q:   Good point. Though slightly grovely.<br>E:   Very well. When I fell in love I didn't know she was a woman. I<br>     thought she was a boy.<br>M:   But of course that makes it perfectly acceptable, doesn't it?<br>Q:   Oh all right, go on and marry her.<br>E:   Thank you, ma'm.<br>Q:   Just tell me one thing. Is her nose as pretty as mine?<br>E:   Oh, no, no.. ma'm.<br>Q:   Oh good, because otherwise I would have cut it off. And then you<br>     would have to marry someone without a nose and that wouldn't be very<br>     nice, would it?<br>E:   No ma'm.<br>Q:   Imagine the mess when she's got a cold! Yuck!<br>E:   Well, quite ma'm.<br>Q:   All right, off you go then.<br>[Edmund leaves]<br>Q:   Everyone seems to get married except me.<br>N:   And me, Ma'm.<br>Q:   Oh shut up, Bernard.<br><br><br>At Blackadders residence.<br><br>K:   You'll make a lovely bridesmaid Baldrick. Pity me that I have no<br>     actual girl chums because we were so poor in our house we couldn't<br>     afford friends.<br>E:   It is strangely in keeping with the manner of our courtship that<br>     your maid of honour should be a man.<br>B:   Thank you very much my lord.<br>E:   Well, I use the word man in an as broad as possible sense because we<br>     all know God made man in his own image. It would be a sad look out<br>     for christians around the globe if God looked any like you,<br>     Baldrick.<br>K:   Ignore old Mister Grumpy. There you are, Boulders. Hmm, you look<br>     sweet as a little pie.<br>E:   Kate, he looks like what he is: a dung ball in a dress.<br>[Percy enters]<br>S:   Oh Edmund... [sees the bridesmaid]<br>     Hello there... Edmund, you didn't tell me we were expecting guests.<br>     And such a pretty one too.<br>E:   Oh God...<br>S:   Now you're a little cuty to be hiding your self away all these<br>     years. Tell me gorgeous, what is your name?<br>E:   He's called Baldrick.<br>S:   Baldrick.. that's a pretty name. Edmund used to have a servant<br>     called Baldrick. But anyway, away with such small-talk. Lady.. a<br>     kiss!<br>b:   What?<br>S:   And so modest too. Come on you little tease. You know you want to.<br>     Give us a kiss.<br>b:   All right, if you say so. [kisses Percy heavily]<br>S:   Ohghw...he.. what an original perfume.<br>E:   That is our Baldrick. He's wearing a dress.<br>S:   Ourgh..<br>E:   Anyway, what do you want?<br>S:   Ourgh... well euh.. [deep voice] Edmund, there has been some<br>     discussion around the Court on the subject of who's going to be your<br>     best man and I thought it might be the moment to bring the subject<br>     to a conclusion.<br>E:   Ah yes, Percy. I would like you...<br>S:   Oh, I'm so proud!<br>E:   Please let me finish. I would like you to take this letter to Dover<br>     where is recently docked the galleon of my old school friend and<br>     adventurer Lord Flashheart. He shall be my best man.<br>S:   Lord Flash Heart. The best sword, the best shot, the best sailor and<br>     the best kisser in the kingdom.<br>E:   Even he. To Dover at once!<br>S:   Yes. Actually I was going to suggest Lord Flash Heart as the best<br>     man my self.<br>E:   Were you?<br>[S leaves, crying his eyes out]<br><br>In front of the church.<br><br>[Wedding bells]<br>K:   Edmund I cannot believe it is really happening.<br>E:   It is, my sweet.<br>K:   Before we go in I want you to meet my father.<br>E:   Oh fine!<br>E:   [to the old man standing near them] Excuse me, could you move along<br>     please. Look, I'm waiting for my father in law. Last thing I want is<br>     some scruffy old beggar blocking the church door, smelling of<br>     cabbage.<br>F:   I am your father in law.<br>E:   Oh no... All right, how much you want to clear off?<br>K:   Edmund, how could you? He's my father, my only living relative.<br>F:   Ten pounds should do the trick.<br>K:   Father!<br>E:   All right, there we go.<br>K:   Edmund, you mustn't!<br>E:   No, don't worry, I'll get Baldrick to beat him up after the<br>     ceremony. We'll get the money back. Come on, we're late.<br><br><br>In the court of Queen Elizabeth.<br><br>Q:   Ah Edmund. Could we get on do you think? I want to get to the<br>     reception so I can get squiffy and seduce someone.<br>E:   Yes.. oh.. unfortunately ma'm, my best man still has not arrived.<br>Q:   Well, get another one.<br>E:   Ma'm, there is no one else I can really think of.<br>S:   Euh.<br>E:   Sorry Percy?<br>S:   Nothing my lord, just clearing my throat.<br>E:   Don't. I don't want you coughing all the way through the ceremony.<br>Q:   Oh, come on Edmund. You must be able to think of another best man. <br>E:   Well, I suppose I could ask Percy. Percy! <br>S:   My lord! <br>E:   Can you think of another best man?<br>S:   Well my lord. One name does spring to mind.<br>E:   Yes. But I can't ask Baldrick. He's a bridesmaid and besides, I need<br>     a friend, an equal, an old and trusty companion.<br>S:   I think there is one person in the room who fits the description.<br>E:   Of course... Nursie! How do you fancy putting on a pair of hose and<br>     being my best man?<br>Q:   Edmund, don't be so naughty. You know perfectly well whom Percy is<br>     referring to.<br>E:   All right, I'm sorry. Melchard! [squeak] All right! All right! As<br>     ashamed as I am and contradiction in terminus though it is, Percy,<br>     you can be the best man.<br>S:   Oh, my lord! Noble cause, oh what an honour. I brought along a ring,<br>     just...<br>E:   I really did think old Flash would have turned up.<br><br>[Lord Flashheart enters in spectacular fashion]<br>F:   It's me, Flash! Flash by name, Flash by nature. Hurrah!<br>E:   Where have you been?<br>F:   Where haven't I been! ..Waugh!!!.. But I'm here now.<br>F:   Who is that?<br>E:   I don't know, but he is in your place.<br>F:   Not for long. Hold that.<br>[Hands his sword to Baldrick, then throws Percy through the door]<br>F:   Thanks bridesmaid, like the beard. Gives me something to hang on to.<br>F:   So me old mate Eddie is getting hitched, hey? What's the matter?<br>     Can't stand the pace of the mmmm [grabs Edmund's tights].<br>     Hey queeny. You look sexy. Listen, wear your hair long, I prefer it<br>     that way.<br>Q:   [to the camera] I've got such a crush on him.<br>F:   Hey Melchie! Still worshipping God? Last thing I heard He started<br>     worshipping ME...<br>     Ah Nursie, I like it firm and fruity. Am I pleased to see you or did<br>     I just put a canoe in my pocket? Down boy, down. And now... where is<br>     this amazing bird? The one who stopped my old pall Eddie doing<br>     exactly whatever he wants, ten times a night.<br>E:   Ah yes Flash, let me introduce my... my fiancee Kate.<br>F:   Hi, baby! [Flash kisses the bride]<br>F:   She's got a tongue like an electric eel and she likes the taste of a<br>     man's tonsils. You don't want to marry this jerk baby? Meet me on my<br>     horse in eight seconds. <br>K:   But I can't run in this frock. You see, I found I actually preferred<br>     wearing boys clothes.<br>F:   Weird. I always feel more comfy in a dress. I got a plan and it's as<br>     hot as my pants.<br>E:   What a man Flash is, eh? Things will certainly liven around here,<br>     now he's back. Flash. Flash??<br>[Flash (in dress) and Kate (in boys clothes) on a horse, about to depart]<br>F:   So long, suckers! Next time you get bored with your lives just give<br>     me a call and I'll come round and kill you.<br>K:   Bye Edmund and thanks for everything. Hurrah!<br>[Flash leaves in the same style as he arrived]<br><br>M:   It is customary on these occasions for the groom to marry the<br>     bridesmaid. I presume you intend to honour this.<br>B:   I do.<br><br><br>[Song]<br><br>So Flash Heart tweaked the Adders beard,<br>from now he always shall be single.<br>To fall in love with boys is weird,<br>especially boys without a tingle.<br>Blackadder, Blackadder. His taste is rather odd.<br>Blackadder, Blackadder a randy little sod.<br>Lord Flash Heart, Lord Flash Heart, I wish you were the star.<br>Lord Flash Heart, Lord Flash Heart, you're sexier by far.<br><br>BBC MCMLXXXV  AD.<br>[The end]<br><br><br><br>
