He suggested the report may be revised to reflect the government's "positive" view of the station. <br><br>Meanwhile, a US government public diplomacy commission has recommended that the BBG's request for increased funding be approved. <br><br>Democratic Senator Joseph Bidden praised Sawa and Al-Hurra for reaching 27m Arab speakers, a 13-fold audience increase over two years. <br><br>"They have set a new standard for innovation in US international broadcasting. We are doing a much better job of broadcasting to the people of the Middle East." <br><br><br>Story from BBC NEWS:<br><A HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/middle_east/3743624.stm"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/middle_east/3743624.stm></A><br><br>Published: 2004/10/14 18:12:53 GMT<br><br><br>
