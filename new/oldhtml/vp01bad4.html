Managing Terrorism After 9/11: the War On Terror<br>The Media, and the Imagined Threat*<br>Cristina Archetti and Prof. Philip M. Taylor<br><br><br>The paper argues that, in the post -9/11 world, managing the imagined threat of terrorism<br>is as much, if not more, important than dealing with its real threat. This is not only due to<br>the peculiar nature of the global War On Terror, a struggle for "hearts and minds" and for<br>the moral high ground, but also to the relevance of perceptions within an increasingly<br>media-saturated international environment. Starting from the analysis of the<br>government/media interactions in a range of terrorist alerts in the UK, the paper identifies<br>a series of problem areas in successfully countering the imagined threat. They not only<br>apply to the UK, but to the whole Euro-Atlantic context and span from defining (framing)<br>the threat in "manageable" terms to approaching the media as a different kind of actor<br>than normally regarded by politicians. The research suggests that, if these problems are<br>not addressed, they could not only contribute to a heightened sense of society's<br>vulnerability, but also to a weakening of trust in authorities and the information they<br>provide the public with. This would, in turn, erode our democratic institutions and<br>ultimately raise the question of whether we can really win the war on terrorism.<br>Argument & Overview<br>The paper's main line of argument is that managing the imagined threat of terrorism is an<br>essential part of dealing with the terrorist danger and that the media, willingly or not, play<br>a vital role within this context. What the report argues is neither that counter-terrorist<br>policies are not useful or necessary, nor that the threat of terrorism is "imaginary". Of<br>course the threat is real and needs to be dealt with through a variety of measures. What<br>the research want to draw the attention on is the fact that the way we think about the<br>terrorist threat may not necessarily reflect its reality. In other words the way we perceive<br>the terrorist threat is constructed (framed) through the way social actors, especially<br>politicians and the media, talk about it. This framing, although occurring in the abstract<br>world of perceptions, has far reaching consequences in the real world, including the way<br>we practically deal with terrorism and our sense of vulnerability as a society. This paper<br>looks at how the perception of the terrorist threat is shaped through language and rhetoric<br>* The research for this paper was undertaken as part of the ESRC-funded project on the Domestic Management of Terrorism led by<br>King's College, London in 2002-03.<br>2<br>by governmental actors and the media. It specifically looks at a range of case studies<br>represented by terrorist alerts occurred in the UK in the period 2003 to 2004.<br>The argument will unfold in five steps:<br>1. An Introduction explains why perceptions are particularly relevant in the context of<br>the War on Terrorism<br>2. The section Theoretical Debate, Method and Case Studies describes how the<br>framing analysis fits into the wider context of International Relations studies about<br>security and provides some information about the research methodology and the case<br>studies that have been analysed<br>3. Findings illustrates the observations concerning the case studies<br>4. Interpreting the Data is an attempt at drawing some lessons out of the material. What<br>do the results suggest us on how to deal with the terrorist threat?<br>5. The Conclusions explore the challenges ahead<br>1. INTRODUCTION<br>The WOT and Public Perceptions: the Struggle for the Information<br>Space<br>President Bush has defined the War on Terrorism (WOT) 'a new kind of war', a kind of<br>conflict that has never been fought before. The WOT is a struggle being waged on several<br>fronts, including the law enforcement, legislative and financial fronts as well as the world<br>of secret intelligence. There have been military confrontations with the terrorists in<br>Afghanistan and Iraq, but the real nature of the WOT seems to be laying elsewhere. As<br>illustrated by the intense rhetorical debate preceding the Iraq war, but perhaps even more<br>by the recent release of pictures about the torture of Iraqi detainees at the Abu Ghraib<br>prison, the WOT appears as a propaganda war, a "struggle for hearts and minds". The<br>WOT is, from this point of view, a war to win the moral high ground in the global public<br>domain. This really defines the peculiar nature of the WOT and is underlined by Western<br>politicians' acknowledgement of the need to explain the Arab world that this 'war' is not<br>a clash of civilizations. In Tony Blair's words, it is necessary to bridge a 'gulf of<br>misunderstanding'. This requires the use of perception management or, less<br>euphemistically, propaganda.<br>Information needs to be deployed to explain the reasons and objectives of the WOT to<br>domestic and foreign audiences, but also as an offensive weapon to counter terrorists'<br>moves. The terrorist global network, in fact, uses propaganda as a key weapon in its<br>asymmetric struggle against the West. This is illustrated by the fact that most damage to<br>the West seems currently to be inflicted by fear deriving from a heightened sense of<br>vulnerability of our society rather than by actual attacks. In this perspective the WOT is a<br>3<br>struggle to shape public perceptions as well as an international conflict which, far from<br>being confined to a physical battleground, extends to a global 'information space'.<br>This is the context in which the media become crucial. On the one hand they carry the<br>terrifying images of successful attacks delivering worldwide audiences a message of<br>terror. The media are exploited by terrorists who know how to maximise their publicity.<br>This is exemplified by the very 9/11 attacks' spectacular choreography or, more recently,<br>by the decapitation of an American businessman, Nicholas Berg, in front of the cameras<br>(May 12th 2004). Especially the last example suggests a sophisticated use of the media by<br>the terrorists. In fact, beside the obvious horror of the murder, the orange suite worn by<br>the victim and reminding of the detainees at Guantanamo Bay was most probably meant<br>to deliver an additional message. The images evoked the anti-American arguments about<br>Bush administration's double standards, particularly its hypoc ritical rhetoric of respect<br>for human rights and freedom vs. illegal imprisonment. On the other hand media play a<br>role within governmental measures against terrorism. In fact Governments need to be<br>able to inform the public to make it aware of the terrorist threat. This serves both to create<br>support for the authorities' anti-terrorist action and to insulate the public from terrorists'<br>attempt to spread panic and destabilize society. This strategy has to be deployed when<br>communicating with the public and necessarily has to go through the media filter.<br>Is this an overstating the role of perceptions and rhetoric? Does what politicians or the<br>media say matter that much? Isn't it what social actors actually do that counts at the end<br>of the day when dealing with security issues and in trying to counter terrorists who,<br>ultimately, want to inflict physical harm?<br>2. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK, METHOD AND CASE<br>STUDIES<br>2.1. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK<br>The research's understanding of the role of language reflects one of the recent<br>developments in International Relations theory. This is the attempt at integrating the<br>growing role and impact of communications technology on international politics into<br>traditional studies. Here I refer to the approach of the Copenhagen School, mainly<br>represented by Barry Buzan, Ole Waever, Jaap de Wilde and to their concept of<br>'securitization' and 'societal threat'. 1<br>1 Buzan, B., O. Waever, et al., Eds. (1998). Security: A New Framework for Analysis. London, Lynne Rienner Publishers.<br>4<br>The theorists of the Copenhagen school regard the very issue of security as constructed<br>through speech-acts. Which issues belong to the 'security' box cannot be determined a<br>priori, but it is the result of rhetorical choices. In other words how issues are constructed<br>and perceived is the result of a process involving a selection of language, which is not<br>just seen as describing reality but as creating it. This can be applied, as an example, to the<br>WOT. We all talk about a WOT, politicians refer to it, media mention it. The WOT,<br>however, before the 9/11 attacks, did not exist. It came about because someone, the U.S.<br>Government, started to talk about it. This also applies to the shift in foreign policy<br>priorities after 9/11 and terrorism becoming the number one security issue on the global<br>political agenda.2<br>The Copenhagen School theorists also talk about the concept of "societal threat".<br>Differently from traditional Realist or Neo-realist approaches this is a threat to security,<br>interestingly an 'existential threat', that is not conceived in exclusive military terms, just<br>aiming at undermining the territorial integrity of the state. In this concept the very<br>identity of a group is undermined 'by dynamics as diverse as cultural flows, economic<br>integration, or population movements'.3 The concept can again be applied to the WOT,<br>especially the idea that terrorism is far more than a physical threat to life. It is a threat, as<br>PM T. Blair or President G. Bush put it, 'to our civilization' and 'our way of life', to the<br>very stability and 'survival' of our societies. T. Blair actually referred to it using the very<br>word 'existential'.4<br>This is the broader theoretical framework for the analysis of a range of case studies in the<br>UK.<br>2.2. CASE STUDIES<br>Heathrow airport alert (February 11-13 2003): 450 troops, 1000 extra police and light<br>armoured vehicles are dispatched to Heathrow airport following intelligence warnings<br>about a possible terrorist attack on the occasion of the end of the Muslim festival of Eid<br>(February 15th). Heightened security measures are adopted in other airports around the<br>country and in the proximity of government build ings in London.<br>Istanbul bombing (November 20 2003): 2 bombs directed at British targets, the British<br>Consulate and a branch of the HSBC bank, explode in Istanbul killing 28 people, 3 of<br>which British.<br>Flight delays (December 2003 to February 2004): a series of delays involving<br>transatlantic flights to the U.S. over the Christmas period and the beginning of 2004. The<br>2 Williams, M. C. (2003). "Words, Images, Enemies: Securitization and International Politics." International Studies Quarterly (47):<br>511-531.<br>3 'Even further from an exclusively military-territorial focus is the concept of "societal" security, in which the identity of a group is<br>presented as threatened by dynamics as diverse as cultural flows, economic integration, or population movements', Ibid. p. 513.<br>4 'the nature of the global threat we face in Britain and round the world is real and existential', PM Warns of Continuing Global Terror<br>Threat, March 5 2004, <A HREF="http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page5461.asp"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page5461.asp></A><br>5<br>case study includes the media coverage of, among the rest, the grounding of Air France<br>flight 68 from Paris to Los Angeles on Christmas Eve , BA flight 223 from Heathrow to<br>Washington (cancelled several times at beginning of January), BA flight 263 from<br>Heathrow to Riyadh (Saudi Arabia) on December 31 2003.<br>Madrid bombing (March 11 2004): short after 7.30 local time four bombs explode on a<br>train approaching Atocha station, the main train station in Madrid. Minutes later two<br>more bombs detonate at El Pozo and one at Eugenia stations. The attacks left 192 people<br>dead and more than 1,200 injured. The Spanish Government first blamed the Basque<br>separatist terrorist group ETA for the attacks. Another lead in the investigation about who<br>was behind the bombing started to develop when, a few hours after the attacks, a van<br>containing detonators and tapes with verses of the Koran was found in the outskir ts of<br>Madrid. A letter purporting to come from al-Qaida and addressed to the London-based<br>Arabic newspaper al-Quds also claimed responsibility for the train bombing.<br>The range of cases studies selected gives the opportunity of analysing how both officials<br>and the media dealt with events of a different nature. The case studies include simple<br>alerts and actual attacks, both in the run up to the war in Iraq and afterwards. The Istanbul<br>bombing throws light on the coverage of an attack on British interests on foreign soil,<br>while the Madrid bombing provides some information about the way both the British<br>press and authorities reacted to an attack abroad.<br>2.3. METHOD<br>The research is based on a multidisciplinary approach combining a tool of political<br>communication, framing, with discourse analysis within a comparative research design.<br>Framing essentially refers to the construction of issues through language by means of<br>selection and saliency. According to R. Entman 'To frame is to select some aspects of a<br>perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as<br>to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation,<br>and/or treatment recommendation for the item described'.5<br>Taking Entman's definition as a starting point I have explored the frames related to the<br>terrorist threat through qualitative content analysis of both politicians' and media<br>discourses. The analysis has been carried out through the methodological tools of<br>discourse analysis.<br>I have essentially compared the political and media discourses in order to identify the<br>interactions between media and politicians and find out which source is effectively<br>5 Entman, R. M. (1993). "Framing: Toward Clarification of a Fractured Paradigm." Journal of Communication 43(4), p. 52.<br>6<br>shaping the perceptions of the terrorist threat and where media contents actually come<br>from. This procedure allows capturing the information exchanges among social actors to<br>identify the mechanisms that operate within the information space.<br>Sample<br>Governmental/officials' statements constitute the "political discourse": speeches given by<br>the Prime Minister, official briefings and press conferences, parliamentary debates,<br>information available on governmental websites. 6<br>The "media discourse" is represented by both text and video sources:<br>1. The Press coverage by 6 national newspapers: The Guardian/The Observer, The<br>Times/The Sunday Times, The Independent/The Independent on Sunday, The Daily<br>Mirror/Sunday Mirror, The Daily Mail/Mail on Sunday, The Sun/News of the World.7<br>2. TV coverage on 4 channels' evening news programmes: News at Ten (BBC1) ,<br>Newsnight (BBC2), ITV News (ITV), Channel 4 News (CHANNEL 4) and weekend<br>political programmes such as Breakfast with Frost (Saturday morning BBC1) and<br>Jonathan Dimbleby (Sunday morning? ITV). 8<br>Objectives of the Analysis<br>The analysis aimed at:<br>1. Identifying the extent to which the way political authorities framed the problem of<br>terrorism and the war against it (i.e. the language they used to describe these aspects) had<br>an impact on the media and on public perceptions of the threat<br>2. Defining the role of the media as a mediator between the Government and the public.<br>This last question particularly refers to testing the widespread claim that the media tend<br>to sensationalise, create hype and, possibly, encourage panic/alarmism.<br>6 The material has been retrieved from a variety of sources: 10 Downing Street - <A HREF="http://www.number-10.gov.uk/"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=http://www.number-10.gov.uk></A> , The United<br>Kingdom Parliament - <A HREF="http://www.parliament.uk/"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=http://www.parliament.uk/></A>, The Home Office Website- <A HREF="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/terrorism/index.html"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/terrorism/index.html></A> ,<br>The MET Police Website - <A HREF="http://www.met.police.uk/"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=http://www.met.police.uk/></A><br>7 Newspapers' sources - Sample:<br>The sample for the content analysis is made up by articles retrieved from the Lexis-Nexis database through the search-words<br>""terrorist OR terrorism OR terror". This allows retrieving all articles dealing with the topic of terrorism, the "war on terrorism" (also<br>called "war on terror") and related issues. All articles mentioning the keywords have been considered. The time span of the analysis<br>covers every day from the first mention of the of the events considered in each case study (for example the dispatch of troops to<br>Heathrow airport on February 11th is first mentioned on February 12th's newspapers) until no more references are made to it (but no<br>longer than 14 days afterwards).<br>8 Video footage - Sample:<br>The TV coverage sample is made up of the daily evening news (BBC's1 News at Ten, BBC2's Newsnight, ITV's ITV News, Channel<br>4's Channel 4 News) and weekend political programmes such as BBC1's Breakfast with Frost and ITV's Jonathan Dimbleby. The<br>time span considered extends from the day the events considered by each case occurred (the Heathrow airport alert, for example, is<br>reported on the same day it occurred, February 11th) to the following 3 days.<br>7<br>3. FINDINGS<br>The research has led to three main findings: the first is about politicians' framing of the<br>terrorist threat having an effect on media coverage's contents. The second concerns the<br>nature of the media, while the third challenges the myths about the role of politicians, the<br>media and their relationship.<br>3.1. POLITICIANS' FRAMING AND ITS EFFECT ON MEDIA<br>COVERAGE<br>A comparison between statements by political sources and the content of media coverage<br>reveals that the way politicians define the problem of terrorism and describe it has a<br>substantial impact on media performance. This refers, above all, to the contents of the<br>coverage and the amount as well as depth of criticism expressed against the<br>Government's messages. This will be illustrated by comparing official rhetoric's changes<br>over time and corresponding media coverage in three of the case studies: the Heathrow<br>airport alert, the Istanbul bombing and the Madrid attacks. They highlight how the<br>political context created by politicians' rhetoric shapes the ove rall understanding of the<br>media and the way they convey official messages to the wider public.<br>3.1.1. THE SHIFT IN THE U.K. GOVERNMENT'S RHETORIC<br>While the U.S. Government's portrayal of what the WOT is about has been extremely<br>consistent, starting from the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the U.K.<br>Government's framing of the terrorist threat has evolved over time.<br>This is what President Bush declared the day following the WTC and Pentagon attacks.<br>'The deliberate and deadly attacks which were carried out yesterday<br>against our country were more than acts of terror. They were acts of war.<br>This will require our country to unite in steadfast determination and<br>resolve. Freedom and democracy are under attack.<br>The American people need to know that we're facing a different enemy<br>than we have ever faced. This enemy hides in shadows, and has no regard<br>for human life. This is an enemy who preys on innocent and<br>unsuspecting people, then runs for cover. But it won't be able to run for<br>cover forever. This is an enemy that tries to hide. But it won't be able to<br>hide forever. This is an enemy that thinks its harbors are safe. But they<br>won't be safe forever.<br>8<br>This enemy attacked not just our people, but all freedom-loving people<br>everywhere in the world. The United States of America will use all our<br>resources to conquer this enemy. We will rally the world. We will be<br>patient, we will be focused, and we will be steadfast in our determination.<br>This battle will take time and resolve. But make no mistake about it: we<br>will win.<br>'America is united. The freedom-loving nations of the world stand by our<br>side. This will be a monumental struggle of good versus evil. But good<br>will prevail.'9<br>The interpretation of the 9/11 events is very clear: the attacks are as an 'act of war' on<br>civilization (problem definition) by evil terrorists (moral evaluation) motivated by hate<br>for human life (causal interpretation) against which the world should unite to defeat<br>barbarity and defend freedom (treatment recommenda tion). This frame has not been<br>changed since the attacks and has helped the U.S. Government placing both domestic and<br>international events that have followed 9/11 (such as terrorist alerts, counter-terrorist<br>measures, military operations in Afghanistan or in Iraq, but also restrictions of civil<br>liberties) into a solid context.<br>The U.K. Government, by contrast, did not provide a similarly strong post-9/11 frame. If<br>we compare the Lord Major Speech (November 11th 2002), regarded as the<br>Government's blueprint for its anti-terrorist strategy to another speech held with G. Bush<br>in occasion of his state visit to Britain at the time of the Istanbul bombings (November<br>20th 2003), it is possible to notice a huge change in rhetoric. The second speech marks a<br>clear move towards the U.S. Government's frame. This is even more obvious in a speech<br>by the PM on March 5th 2004.<br>But let's have a closer look at how the shifting rhetoric changed the points of reference<br>for the media's understanding of terrorist alerts and attacks.<br>3.1.2. THE ORIGINS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S ANTI-TERRORIST<br>STRATEGY<br>The first speech:10<br>'WMD is but one aspect of the new dangers we face. The Cold War has<br>ended. The great ideological battle between Communism and Western<br>liberal democracy is over. Most countries believe both in markets and in<br>a necessary role for Government. There will be thunderous debates inside<br>9 President G. W. Bush, Remarks by the President in Photo Opportunity with the National Security Team, September 12 2001,<br><A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010912-4.html"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010912-4.html></A>.<br>10 PM speech at the Lord Mayor's Banquet, November 11 2002, <A HREF="http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page1731.asp"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page1731.asp></A>.<br>9<br>nations about the balance, but the struggle for world hegemony by<br>political ideology is gone.<br>What preoccupies decision-makers now is a different danger. It is<br>extremism driven by fanaticism, personified either in terrorist groups or<br>rogue states.'<br>'So: these are new times. New threats need new measures. The simplest<br>act of fanaticism carried out in a state thousands of miles from us is of<br>significance on the streets of London or in the villages of County Durham.<br>The interdependence of the modern world has never been clearer; the<br>need for a common response never greater; the values of freedom, justice<br>and tolerance of our diversity never more relevant; and the need to apply<br>them fairly across the world never more urgent.'<br>The Government describes here the terrorist threat in very vague terms. Tony Blair says<br>that we are living in 'new times' in which 'new threats' required 'new measures'. 'These<br>dangers', identified in a not better-defined connection among 'WMD', 'extremism' and<br>'rogue states' 'can strike at any time, across any national boundary and in pursuit of a<br>cause with which there can be little or no rational negotiation'. No mention was made of<br>a "war against terrorism".<br>The Heathrow Alert: Government's "Mistakes" and Public Scepticism<br>The Heathrow airport alert is particularly interesting in highlighting the tight interlink<br>between the media and official sources and how the mismanagement of information by<br>authorities can translate into a failure of the 'informing, but not alarming the public'<br>strategy. The lack of background information concerning what the very threat of<br>terrorism, let alone a whole "war on terrorism", was about represents the main reason<br>behind the Government's lack of success in handling the situation. In very short terms<br>this was the mechanism that led to such an outcome: the information vacuum about the<br>very nature of the threat or Government's engagement in a WOT translated into the<br>absence of mentions of a WOT in the media coverage. In this context the attempt of the<br>Government at informing the public did not contribute to any better public knowledge of<br>the situation. Officials' messages appeared just empty repetition of soundbites. By then<br>the general perception was that the threat was not real, let alone imminent, as the<br>Government had encouraged the public to believe. 11 The presence of some slight<br>inconsistencies in Government's words and deeds amplified public and media's initial<br>scepticism into outright cynicism and allegations that the sending of light armoured<br>vehicles to Heathrow was a "PR stunt".<br>11 This is the statement by the Metropolitan Police announcing the despatch of troops at Heathrow airport: 'The current strengthening<br>of security is precautionary and is related to action being taken in other countries and the possibility that the end of the religious<br>festival of Eid may erroneously be used by Al Qaida and associated networks to mount attacks. The strengthened security, which is<br>likely to be most visible to the public at Heathrow Airport, relates to a potential threat to the capital' MET Police Website, Heightened<br>Levels of Security in London, February 11 2003, <A HREF="http://www.met.police.uk/pns/DisplayPN.cgi?pn_id=2003_0028"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=http://www.met.police.uk/pns/DisplayPN.cgi?pn_id=2003_0028></A>.<br>10<br>Let's have a closer look at each of the above-mentioned stages and at how the crisis<br>unfolded.<br>No War On Terrorism<br>Although the WOT is assumed by the Government as a "naturally understood"<br>framework for the antiterrorist measures adopted during the airport alert, there is no<br>evidence of the media perceiving its relevance. The "official WOT" did not exist in the<br>media's perspective. And if it did, it was not clear what it referred to. This will be<br>illustrated by some examples.<br>In the coverage of the events the expressions "War on Terrorism" and "War on Terror"<br>are used interchangeably and often replaced by 'fight against terror',12 'fight against<br>terrorism' 13 or 'battle against terrorism' 14 that, in their respective contexts, simply refer to<br>a generalised idea of taking measures against terrorism. This is the emerging trend in the<br>broadsheets.<br>The War on Terrorism and the War on Terror, when mentioned at all, are referred to<br>within an official context, usually within a quote from officials or in some way related to<br>state policies. An example of WOT mentioned by an official comes from The Times<br>covering the calling off of a military air show in a RAF airbase in Suffolk. Colonel<br>Donald Lustig explains in an interview: 'Some of our men and aircraft have already been<br>deployed as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. The unpredictability of the ongoing<br>war on terrorism has increased the operations tempo here and on other bases'.15<br>The Independent offers another case:<br>'&France is convinced that a US-led invasion - however short and<br>surgical - will compound hatred of the West in the Islamic world and<br>make the "war on terror", which should take precedence, harder to win'.16<br>When not mentioned within an official context, the WOT appears to be often completely<br>misunderstood. This is particularly evident in The Independent. The War on Terrorism<br>or the War on Terror are portrayed more as a reality belonging to President George W.<br>Bush's policy and U.S foreign policy, not involving Britain. In other words, it is not<br>Britain's War on Terrorism, but America's.<br>'The Israeli authorities have repeatedly sought to present their conflict<br>with the Palestinians as equivalent to president George Bush's "war on<br>terror".17<br>12 For example The Times, Army man to help firms fight terror, May 18, 2003 and The Guardian, We are going to France where race<br>relations are a lot worse than in Britain, February 16 2003.<br>13The fight against terrorism has increased the number of little indignities at airport security checks', The Independent, BAA could<br>still fly high in a war, February 15 2003.<br>14 The Independent, Patience will be a vital weapon in the long battle against terrorism, February 14 2003.<br>15 The Times, Suffolk military air show is called off, February 14 2003.<br>16 The Independent, Irreconcilable differences of opinion? A tale of two world views great gulf fixed between UK and France,<br>February 12 2003.<br>11<br>Some articles very clearly reveal basic misunderstandings about the meaning of the<br>WOT:<br>'This is becoming like a dark Peter Sellers farce in which the main players<br>pursue a complicated red herring while the more dangerous villains make<br>hay. Mr Blair is fighting for his political future over a likely war with Iraq.<br>President Bush, addressing troops heading for the Gulf, crudely conflates<br>the looming conflict with the war against terrorism. The rest of the UN<br>agonises over Hans Blix, under pressure to contrive a unity that does not<br>exist. While the world looks away, the terrorists prepare to strike'. 18<br>The following quote reveals a lack of understanding of the WOT within U.S. foreign<br>policy's objectives:<br>'When Mr Blair expressed unqualified support for the US in the aftermath<br>of the Twin Towers, he had a choice. He could sign up for the campaign<br>against terrorism or he could sign up for the whole voyage. By choosing<br>the latter, he sought to maximise his influence but, in truth, irretrievably<br>circumscribed his freedom of action. Mr Blair's bargain with George Bush<br>is truly Faustian'.19<br>This article interprets the 'campaign against terrorism' as something different from what<br>is currently occurring, as if the WOT had finished with the war in Afghanistan. This last<br>point is confirmed by the following:<br>'When we fought the war against terrorism by invading Afghanistan, one<br>of the arguments made to justify the war was that the Taliban was a harsh<br>and immoral regime'. 20<br>Other interesting examples of misunderstanding of the WOT come from The Sun. This is<br>the only newspaper having a section specifically called "War On Terror". This is absent<br>in the rest of the press, usually placing articles related to the airport alert under the label<br>"The Threat of War" (The Guardian) or "Iraq Crisis" (The Times). The Sun's WOT<br>section, however, contains a variety of questionable contents such as articles on asylum21<br>(which implies an association of the terrorist threat with asylum seekers) as well as news<br>that has no clear connection with actual terrorism. An example of an unrelated article<br>appears on 17 February - 'US troop jets forced back to Shannon in engine scares'.22 This<br>17 The Independent, Israeli army seals borders after exceptional number of terrorist attack warnings, February 12 2003.<br>18 The Independent on Sunday, Tighter airport security would do more than a second UN resolution, February 16 2003.<br>This point is also made by the following quote:<br>'the Prime Minister ought to know, that the numbers on the streets today [anti-war protest] will have been swelled by two things.<br>One was the bellicosity of President Bush in addressing sailors on the USS Philippines Sea this week. His conflation of the war on<br>terror with that on Iraq was unstatesmanlike: "The terrorists brought this war to us - and now we're taking it back to them." Of course,<br>we know the link of logic, in that if Iraq possesses chemical and biological weapons they could come into terrorist hands. But the<br>implication that invading Iraq is the counterpunch to 11 September is dishonest. And the gloating over the deaths of 3,000 suspected<br>terrorists in Afghanistan - "they're not a problem any more" - was offensive'18 The Independent, Mr. Blix has spoken. Today, vast<br>numbers of Britons will speak up. Mr. Blair must listen, February 15 2003.<br>19 The Independent on Sunday, Quick march to war. Whatever happened to Britain's third way? February 16 2003.<br>20 The Independent, The harsh truth about Taliban asylum rights, February 20 2003.<br>12<br>is very interesting because it reports two U.S. troop-carrying jets forced to make an<br>emergency landing at Shannon during the weekend after one of the planes, just returned<br>from duty in the Gulf, started 'suffering engine trouble'. The problem with one of the<br>aircraft's engines is not even attributed to a possible terrorist attack or sabotage (the pilot,<br>according to the article, 'did not declare an emergency and did not seek assistance').<br>There would therefore be no reason to include this article in the section on WOT. This<br>proves that, at least in this tabloid, anything loosely linked to U.S., airplanes, war and<br>their mixture is almost automatically associated to the WOT.<br>The greatest misunderstanding is perhaps failing to see the connection between the Iraq<br>war and the WOT. The Mirror, from this point of view, does not refer to the WOT at all.<br>Repetition of Uninformative Messages<br>The government's communication during the crisis saw the almost obsessive repetition of<br>the same messages. They could have probably been more informative if the public had<br>been adequately prepared to understand them. Given the information vacuum in which<br>they were sent, however, they sounded as empty soundbites. As proof of the extent to<br>which they were repeated, almost always with the same words, is the fact that they are<br>referred to by the media on more than one occasion as the government's 'mantra'.23<br>Apart from the omnipresent recommendation for the public to be "alert but not alarmed",<br>the most recurrent soundbites (the majority of them already present in the Lord Major<br>Speech) were:<br>- the threat from 'international terrorism' is 'real' and 'serious'<br>- the government has to make 'fine judgements' 24 about taking action that is<br>both 'necessary and proportionate';25 'this could never be an exact<br>science'26<br>- the government is taking 'whatever action' 27 it believes necessary 'to<br>protect the public'28<br>- we should not do the terrorists' 'job for them'29<br>- 'people had to get used to the idea that as the threat level rose and fell at<br>different times and in different circumstances, so the security would rise<br>and fall in parallel.'30<br>21 Examples : The Sun, Plug leaks at borders, February 17 2003 and The Sun, Taliban No2 given asylum in Britain, February 17 2003.<br>22 The Sun, US troop jets forced back to Shannon in engine scares, February 17 2003.<br>23 Mark Mardell, News at Ten, BBC1, Feb 11 2003. Also an article on The Times reports that in occasion of the alert 'ministers<br>repeated their mantra that the public should be 'alert but not alarmed'.

We<br>had to take whatever security measures we could consistent with the desire<br>for people to lead normal lives. Given the terrorist threat was real, people<br>had to get used to the idea that the response to it would rise and fall<br>accordingly. This could never be an exact science. There was no rulebook<br>to deal with such things. The guiding principles were to protect the<br>security of the people of this country consistent with the desire to ensure<br>as best [as] we could that we did not do the terrorists' job for them. That<br>was exactly what we were doing'.31<br>That was all that was going to be said. While limiting the release of new information<br>could have been justified on the grounds that, as explained by all officials, it was not safe<br>to give details about an ongoing operation, the authorities actually gave the public the<br>impression tha t they were annoyed by media requests for more information. In fact the<br>Government overestimated the public's capacity to understand the situation.<br>Inconsistencies<br>The combination of the terrorist threat's framing with the course of action actually taken<br>by the government in dealing with the terrorist threat generated a series of inconsistencies<br>that undermined the credibility of the government's strategy. A crude example of this<br>during the airport alert is the contrast between the statements that the threat is 'real',<br>'serious' and specific' and the government's decision not to close any infrastructure.<br>Heathrow remained open and flights continued to operate. 32 Another example is offered<br>by the government's commitment to informing the public clashing with its reluctance,<br>even irritation, to elaborate about the nature of the threat when asked for more details.33<br>Again, contrast the rhetoric that 'we should be "alert but not alarmed"' in the 'new<br>normality after 9/11' with the adoption, as acknowledged by the PM's official<br>spokesman, of exceptional measures.

The Independent, Travellers cancel<br>flights as Blunkett calls for calm, February 14 2003. On The Independent on Sunday, Weariness and fear that haunt ministers,<br>February 16 2003, it is also said that the Home Secretary 'could not hide his exhausted irritation at being summoned to the House of<br>Commons to make a statement on the security threat'.<br>14<br>the biggest security operation on mainland British soil since the 1991 Heathrow terrorist<br>alerts.34<br>As a last example: if, as the government maintained, the threat is everywhere and can<br>strike at any time, that there is no rationality behind the terrorists' aims and that their<br>objective is to kill and cause disruption, how was it that, on this occasion, special security<br>measures including the dispatch of armoured vehicles (whose usefulness in this context<br>would soon be questioned) were taken at specific locations such as Heathrow, other<br>airports and some government building in London?<br>An Unreal Threat<br>The threat, in this perspective, appeared so unconvinc ing as to lead to the interpretation<br>of the tanks' presence at Heathrow mainly as a 'public relations exercise',35 a PR stunt to<br>convince people that it was necessary to support the decision to go to war in Iraq, which<br>even supported the allegation by the Daily Mail that the alert could have been a 'hoax'.36<br>Scepticism is particularly well illustrated by CARTOONS [see report specifically about<br>Heathrow alert for examples. I did not copy them to keep the size of the file small]<br>This is an indicator of how "unreal" the threat appeared to some media. It cannot be ruled<br>out the fact that this may have created more confusion in the public and fostered a sense<br>of uncertainty on what was to be believed. The general impression, however, given the<br>fact that humour was a characteristic of the coverage of most newspapers, is that the<br>media recorded a public mood.<br>3.1.3 THE SECOND SPEECH AND THE ISTANBUL BOMBINGS<br>Here is an excerpt from the PM's second speech on the topic of terrorism. 37 It provides a<br>more sophisticated narrative on how to interpret international events. This includes a<br>description of the terrorists' identity, their motives, our identity as 'people who believe in<br>freedom' and what we can do to counter the global threat of terrorism.<br>'Here is where we have got to. We have got to see what this struggle<br>[against terrorism] is about, because you can see it clearer and clearer<br>day by day. This is a struggle between fanaticism and extremism on the<br>one hand, and people who believe in freedom and intolerance on the<br>34 There are references made by the PMOS to the dispatch of troops in 1994: 'He [PMOS] was not pretending today that the fact the<br>army had been deployed in this capacity for the first time since 1994 was not newsworthy.

And these attacks have been building for years, they came to their<br>height OK on September 11, but that actually wasn't the first attack that al<br>Qu'eda was perpetrating against America and other countries, and you<br>look round the world today and I tell you in virtually every place there is<br>trouble and difficulty, these terrorists are making it worse, whether it is<br>Kashmir, whether it is Palestine, whether it is Chechnya, wherever it is,<br>and they are prepared to kill anyone, they are prepared to shed any<br>amount of bloodshed, because they know how important this battle is. And<br>here is why Iraq is important in this, because in the end their case, which<br>is based on dividing people, the Arab world and the western world, the<br>Muslim world and the Ch ristian world and other religions, their case is<br>that we are in Iraq to suppress Muslims, steal their oil, to spoil the<br>country. Now we know, you know, that all those things are lies. They<br>know therefore that if we manage to get Iraq on its feet as a stable,<br>prosperous, democratic country, the blow we strike is not just one for the<br>Iraqi people, it is the end of that propaganda and that is why they are<br>fighting us. And when you say is this attack today directed at our alliance,<br>it is directed at anybody who stands in the way of this fanaticism. And<br>that is why our response has got to be to say to them as clearly as we<br>possibly can, you are not going to defeat us because our will to defend<br>what we believe in is actually in the end stronger, better, more determined<br>than your will to inflict damage on an innocent people. Now that is what<br>this whole thing is about. That is why when I hear people talking about<br>the alliance between our two countries, this is not an alliance that is based<br>on simply Britain and America and the ties that go back in history and all<br>the rest of it, this is a real living alliance about the struggle going on<br>today in the early 21st century, and if we don't win this struggle, it is not<br>just Britain and America that is going to suffer, people everywhere are<br>going to suffer, and that is why it is important. And if they think that when<br>they go and kill people by these terrorist attacks they are going to<br>somehow weaken us or make us think well let's shuffle to the back of the<br>queue and hide away from this, they are wrong, that is not the tradition of<br>my country and it is not the tradition of the British people or the American<br>people.'38<br>The occasion of a joint press conference with the U.S. President also contributes to a coordination<br>of the UK Government's message with its U.S. counterpart which, as the<br>analysis confirms, proves to be very successful in terms of media management, for the<br>purpose of getting official messages reproduced in the media coverage.<br>38 Press Conference: PM Tony Blair and President George Bush, November 20 2003, <A HREF="http://www.number/"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=http://www.number></A>-<br>10.gov.uk/output/Page5004.asp.<br>16<br>The Istanbul Bombings: Improved Communication<br>The fact that the Government elaborates on the broader context in which the threat should<br>be understood, does change the media coverage. The first observation emerging from the<br>comparison of how the media report about the Heathrow alert and the Istanbul bombing<br>is the media's improved understanding of the terrorist threat. The seriousness and reality<br>of the danger are no longer questioned. Media talk confidently about a WOT and seem to<br>be more "familiar" with it.<br>It cannot be excluded that this outcome is due to a long exposure to the issue of terrorism<br>and the WOT over time. In fact the Istanbul bombing takes place nine months after the<br>Heathrow alert, after the Iraq war, a period in which media coverage was saturated by<br>discussions about terrorism, WMD and ways to deal with threats to security. At the end,<br>this must also be considered, the Heathrow airport alert and the Istanbul bombings are<br>two different kinds of event and no full comparison can be established between them.<br>The analysis seems to suggest, however, that when messages are consistent and they<br>"make sense" within a wider explanatory picture they are reported by the media in the<br>same form as they are issued. Also the media do not feel the need to question or<br>challenge them as much as when they are issued in an information vacuum. It could be<br>argued that the lack of criticism could be explained by the increased deference of the<br>media due to the presence of casualties, some of which British citizens. This does not<br>mean, howeve r, that the media do not criticize the Government at all. Media coverage<br>contained many critical pieces, some of them openly challenging Government's policies.<br>Within the criticism, however, the media did not seem to disagree any longer on the<br>sources of the threat or its nature. Such interpretations actually followed the lines traced<br>by the Government's frame.<br>Let's have a look at a few examples illustrating the reproduction of the basic aspects of<br>the Government's frame, even within critical stands:<br>Frame Reproduction Within Criticism<br>The Daily Mail:<br>'This time, the attack on Britain's consulate and the HSBC bank in<br>Istanbul coincided with President Bush's state visit to this country, thereby<br>achieving the maximum possible impact worldwide.<br>But for what? There is no reason in any of this savagery. This is killing for<br>killing's sake, an insane eruption of hatred and rage not only against<br>America and its allies, but also the principles of Western civilisation itself.<br>And now there are intelligence warnings that an Al Qaeda strike in Britain<br>is inevitable.<br>Tony Blair's response is admirable: 'In the face of this terrorism, there<br>17<br>must be no holding back, no compromise, no hesitation in confronting this<br>menace<br>and defeating it utterly'.<br>Indeed. Such resolution clearly shared by Mr Bush is indispensable in the<br>face of a remorseless evil. But it isn't enough by itself. And the bleak truth<br>is that the mistaken policies of Prime Minister and President have made<br>the defeat of terrorism that much more difficult.'39<br>The Independent:<br>'The terrorists are vile, and their crimes appalling. Yet there are reasons<br>why they are supported and why they flourish in some parts of the world.<br>The war against terrorism is complex and multi-layered. It will be long,<br>arduous and dangerous. There will be no final, climactic victory, just the<br>hope of halting its progress. That hope would be increased if Bush and<br>Blair displayed a greater insight, and a more subtle vision, of the challenge<br>that faces them.' 40<br>The Guardian:<br>'Mr Bush and Mr Blair have made many mistakes since 9/11. There is an<br>urgent need for a radical review of policy. But in the teeth of such terror,<br>there must also be solidarity. Yesterday was Britain's day to mourn, to<br>grieve for our diplomats, our citizens and those many others so cruelly<br>victimised in Istanbul - and grieve we do. But tomorrow, or next week, or<br>next month, if this goes on unchecked, it will be somebody else's awful<br>turn. A candid admission of western failings does not imply submission to<br>barbarity. There is no case for surrender. But there is a very strong case for<br>a more intelligent, less confrontational, combined east-west approach to an<br>intensifying global crisis.'41<br>These are statements from an article by Jason Burke, expert on Islamic militancy:<br>'JACK STRAW was right to say last week that increased security can<br>never make us safe against terrorists of the sort we now face. This is a<br>battle of visions, of perceptions, for hearts and minds, as much as a battle<br>of guns, forensic detection and intelligence. Making progress in the latter,<br>which it is possible we are doing, is nothing without progress in the<br>former. There are now fewer terrorist leaders, but more followers.<br>39 The Daily Mail, Victims of a mindless hate, November 21 2003.<br>40 The Independent on Sunday, We need subtler vision to defeat the terrorists, November 23 2003.<br>41 The Guardian, Istanbul bombs: Reaping the whirlwind, November 21 2003.<br>18<br>Of course a 'war on terror' requires a military component. But we need to<br>eliminate our enemies without simply creating more. Last week al-Qaeda<br>said that 'the cars of death will not stop'. If we fail to counter their warped<br>world-view then their threat will not be idle.'42<br>The Mirror:<br>'JACK Straw looked understandably shocked while touring the rubble of<br>the Istanbul atrocities.<br>But that does not excuse the nonsense the Foreign Secretary talked<br>afterwards.<br>Most ridiculously, he insisted that people believed September 11 happened<br>six months after military action began in Iraq.<br>What people? What circles can Mr Straw possibly move in to think that?<br>The charitable explanation of the Foreign Secretary's words is that he is<br>desperate to support the Bush-Blair approach to the war on terrorism.<br>But that is not the way to win the argument. Not the way to persuade the<br>millions who believe that the attack on Iraq has made things worse.<br>Mr Straw - like President Bush and Tony Blair the previous day - insists<br>that the war on terrorism must be pursued with absolute vigour. We<br>agree.<br>But they also say Iraq is central to it, even though there is not a shred of<br>evidence that al-Qaeda had any presence in that country or contact with<br>Saddam Hussein.<br>A sensible, intelligent debate is essential. From both sides. That means not<br>making wild statements or relying on misinformation.<br>If the Foreign Secretary says the sort of things he did yesterday, those who<br>disagree with the Government's actions will claim it is because he knows<br>he has no valid case.<br>Mr Straw saw for himself the horrors of terrorism. Surely we should be<br>united and honest in finding the best way to deal with it.'43<br>42 The Observer, Where terror begins, November 23 2003.<br>43 The Mirror, Jack's case is clutching at straws, November 22 2003.<br>19<br>Most of media criticism is focused on the perceived lack of a link between 9/11's<br>terrorism and Iraq. This connection is particularly questioned, among the newspape rs, by<br>the Mirror and on TV coverage. Such disagreement is explained by the fact that,<br>contrarily to what happened in the US, the UK Government justified the war in Iraq by<br>focusing its rhetoric on the danger to security represented by Saddam Hussein's WMD.<br>Repetition of Official Soundbites<br>Another aspect that can be observed is the extensive reporting of several governmental<br>soundbites. The following excerpts, especially the second, were reported by virtually all<br>media sources. They were widely interpreted, together with President Bush's coordinated<br>messages, as an expression of a unity of purposes between the American and<br>British fronts as well as a firm determination by both Administrations to fight against<br>terrorism:<br>'First of all I would wish to express my deepest sympathy and<br>condolences to the families of the victims, some will be British, many will<br>be Turkish citizens, I would like to express my condolences also to the<br>government and to the people of Turkey. And once again we are reminded<br>of the evil these terrorists pose to innocent people everywhere, and to our<br>way of life, once again we must affirm that in the face of this terrorism,<br>there must be no holding back, no compromise, no hesitation in<br>confronting this menace, in attacking it wherever and whenever we can,<br>and in defeating it utterly.'<br>'And let me make it absolutely clear for our position as well. We stay until<br>the job gets done. And what this latest terrorist outrage shows us is that<br>this is a war, its main battleground is Iraq. We have got to make sure that<br>we defeat these terrorists - the former Saddam people - in Iraq and we<br>must do that because that is an essential part of defeating this fanaticism<br>and extremism that is killing innocent people all over our world today.<br>And I can assure you of one thing, that when something like this happens<br>today, our response is not to flinch, or give way or concede one inch. We<br>stand absolutely firm until this job is done, done in Iraq, done elsewhere in<br>the world.' 44<br>44 Press Conference: PM Tony Blair and President George Bush, November 20 2003, <A HREF="http://www.number/"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=http://www.number></A>-<br>10.gov.uk/output/Page5004.asp.<br>20<br>3.1.4. THE THIRD SPEECH AND THE MADRID BOMBING 45<br>This speech contributes to further refine the existing narrative by developing the idea of<br>pre-emptive strike as the way for dealing with the current threat from terrorism. The<br>speech received wide TV coverage and was described by Gavin Esler on BBC2's<br>Newsnight as outlining 'almost a "Blair Doctrine"', as 'a statement on what to do about<br>the problems of the world right now and in the future'.<br>'September 11th was for me a revelation. What had seemed inchoate<br>came together. The point about September 11th was not its detailed<br>planning; not its devilish execution; not even, simply, that it happened in<br>America, on the streets of New York. All of this made it an astonishing,<br>terrible and wicked tragedy, a barbaric murder of innocent people. But<br>what galvanised me was that it was a declaration of war by religious<br>fanatics who were prepared to wage that war without limit. They killed<br>3000. But if they could have killed 30,000 or 300,000 they would have<br>rejoiced in it. The purpose was to cause such hatred between Moslems<br>and the West that a religious jihad became reality; and the world engulfed<br>by it.'<br>'Here is the irony. For all the fighting, this threat cannot be defeated by<br>security means alone. Taking strong action is a necessary but insufficient<br>condition for defeating. Its final defeat is only assured by the triumph of<br>the values of the human spirit.<br>Which brings me to the final point. It may well be that under international<br>law as presently constituted, a regime can systematically brutalise and<br>oppress its people and there is nothing anyone can do, when dialogue,<br>diplomacy and even sanctions fail, unless it comes within the definition of<br>a humanitarian catastrophe (though the 300,000 remains in mass graves<br>already found in Iraq might be thought by some to be something of a<br>catastrophe). This may be the law, but should it be?<br>We know now, if we didn't before, that our own self interest is ultimately<br>bound up with the fate of other nations. The doctrine of international<br>community is no longer a vision of idealism. It is a practical recognition<br>that just as within a country, citizens who are free, well educated and<br>prosperous tend to be responsible, to feel solidarity with a society in<br>which they have a stake; so do nations that are free, democratic and<br>benefiting from economic progress, tend to be stable and solid partners in<br>45 PM Warns of Continuing Global Terror Threat, March 5 2004, <A HREF="http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page5461.asp"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page5461.asp></A> .<br>21<br>the advance of humankind. The best defence of our security lies in the<br>spread of our values.<br>But we cannot advance these values except within a framework that<br>recognises their universality. If it is a global threat, it needs a global<br>response, based on global rules.<br>The essence of a community is common rights and responsibilities. We<br>have obligations in relation to each other. If we are threatened, we have a<br>right to act. And we do not accept in a community that others have a right<br>to oppress and brutalise their people. We value the freedom and dignity<br>of the human race and each individual in it.<br>Containment will not work in the face of the global threat that confronts<br>us. The terrorists have no intention of being contained. The states that<br>proliferate or acquire WMD illegally are doing so precisely to avoid<br>containment. Emphatically I am not saying that every situation leads to<br>military action. But we surely have a duty and a right to prevent the<br>threat materialising; and we surely have a responsibility to act when a<br>nation's people are subjected to a regime such as Saddam's. Otherwise,<br>we are powerless to fight the aggression and injustice which over time<br>puts at risk our security and way of life.'<br>Let's explore more in depth how these changes have practically affected the coverage.<br>The Madrid Bombings: Understanding the Threat<br>What emerges from the analysis of the Madrid case study is, again, a wide reproduction<br>of many elements of the Government's frame, especially the ideas that terrorists are evil,<br>have no sensible aim but to kill innocents and that "we are all targets now".<br>The Guardian<br>'Cities have become our battlegrounds; where once they were places of<br>safety to which countryfolk retreated in times of war, they are now where<br>the war is conducted. After 3/11 every citizen of a western European city,<br>of Paris, Rome, Berlin or London, nervously enters the packed tube, the<br>busy commuter train or the high-rise office block. Fear could empty the<br>city and cauterise the mass transit systems that are its lifeblood. One is<br>haunted by an image of shut-down tube stations, of empty streets where<br>weeds break up the Tarmac and everyone retreats home to their laptops,<br>and we look back on the conviviality of the era before mass terrorism with<br>nostalgic disbelief.<br>What's at stake is a long history of the city, that exchange point for trade<br>22<br>and ideas that has been the crux of all civilisations. The city orders how<br>large numbers of human beings live in close proximity. In so doing, it<br>civilises and turns strangers into citizens who belong to a civil society in<br>which they treat each other with (more or less) civility. All these words<br>have the same Latin root, civitas<br>What the demonstrations in Spain remind us is that civility - the measure<br>of goodwill from one stranger to another - is ultimately what makes a<br>city's spirit. It is the accumulation of tiny, daily interactions with bus<br>conduc tors, fellow commuters, newspaper sellers and coffee-shop<br>waitresses - the humour, the greetings, the gestures of help that smooth the<br>rough edges of urban living.'46<br>The Daily Mail:<br>'The sheer scale of the inhumanity which targeted so many Spanish<br>innocents for death demonstrated what we understood on 9/11: that we are<br>up against an enemy of a kind we have not seen before.<br>This is not the IRA-style terrorism with which we are wearily familiar. In<br>Al Qaeda and its associates, we are dealing with a death cult, enemies of<br>life and of humanity itself, who have said: 'We are not fighting for you to<br>offer us something, but to eliminate you.' Indeed, it is vital to grasp that -<br>despite the tape's claims over Iraq and Afghanistan - those who say<br>Madrid was targeted only because Spain supported America are<br>grievously mistaken.'<br>'Too many people, though, still don't grasp the nature of what we are all<br>up against.<br>Instead, they complain we are no safer than before - which is a bit like<br>blaming the Blitz on the fact that we went to war against Germany.<br>Despite the obvious differences, we are in a war now.<br>It was declared upon us and we must defend ourselves. It is not possible to<br>sit it out on the sidelines.<br>It can and must be won; but that will only happen if we all stand shoulder<br>to shoulder, not just with the people of Spain but those of all countries and<br>all faiths who are now under attack.'47<br>46 The Guardian, Terror in Madrid: Europeans must tell the United States where Washington is going wrong in its war on terror,<br>March 13 2004.<br>47 The Daily Mail, We are at war - and it must be won, March 15 2004.<br>23<br>The Mirror:<br>'The war on terrorism is just that - a war. For the terrorists have declared<br>war on us, on the civilised world, on everything that is decent.<br>They don't even have a basic sense of humanity. But that is why they will<br>be beaten.<br>They do appalling things, but we are stronger than them. Not just because<br>we have right on our side but because we are united agains t them.'48<br>The following example from the same newspaper underlines how the acceptance<br>of the Government's frame can coexist with harsh criticism:<br>'"We will not defeat it [terrorism] by hoping it will leave us alone or by<br>hiding away," said Mr Blair. True. But nor will we defeat it by fighting the<br>wrong battles, for the reasons, in the wrong place against the wrong people<br>with the wrong intelligence.<br>That is what we did in Iraq.'49<br>The Media and the Government's "Dilemma"<br>The content analysis confirms the understanding by the media not only of the terrorist<br>threat, but also of the problems of dealing with terrorism. The media clearly understand<br>the Government's "dilemma" of "informing, but not alarming the public" and seem to<br>produce a great amount of constructive criticism, especially in the broadsheets.<br>The Times:<br>'Of course, September 11 did not mark the end of terrorist attacks on<br>military targets around the world. Ask the coalition troops in Iraq. But the<br>twin towers attacks mark a turning point, since when terrorists of many<br>kinds appear to think it legitimate -and fruitful -to attack civilians.<br>That presents governments with new problems. They have the practical<br>problem of trying to protect their citizens from the kind of attack that is<br>almost impossible to prevent. They have legal problems of balancing<br>pursuit of terrorists with civil liberties. And they have a political dilemma<br>-which President Bush has conspicuously not solved -of whether it is in<br>their interests to inflame people's fears that they are living in an era of<br>great danger.'<br>[&]<br>48 The Mirror, These vile killers must not prevail, March 13 2004.<br>49 The Sunday Mirror, Time to target the real enemy, March 14 2004.<br>24<br>'So governments will, no doubt, deploy a mixture of the techniques that<br>have become familiar since September 11. There will be a few, scattered,<br>precise warnings or interventions, such as flights from London to<br>Washington or Riyadh suspended. Then there will be generalised<br>exhortations to be alert, because of a heightened but unspecified -security<br>risk. However, that last tactic is a dangerous political tool. If people are<br>not told what they can do to avoid the threat, or what the government is<br>doing, they may well resent being frightened. As Bush's soaring poll<br>ratings showed after September 11, people are willing to give political<br>leaders credit for rushing to defend them. But if, down the road, they fail<br>to feel safer, they may hold against those leaders any new cause to feel<br>afraid.'50<br>Another example from the same newspaper:<br>'Madrid has confirmed, yet again, that terrorism is the enemy of<br>democracy and all that we stand for. It is a thre<br><br>
