Bush came to power, limiting its ability to influence international crises, an annual survey from a well-regarded British security think-tank concluded yesterday.<br><br>The 2007 strategic survey from the non-partisan International Institute for Strategic Studies picks the decline of US authority as one of the most important security developments of the past year - but suggests the fading of American prestige began earlier, largely due to its failings in Iraq.<br><br>John Chipman, the institute's director-general, said the "authority, prestige and reputation of the US is not what it might have been four or five years ago".<br><br>The deterioration of American power had led to a "non-polar" world in which other actors, such as Russia, had been able to assert themselves.<br><br>The report says the US failure in Iraq had meant the Bush administration suffered from a much-reduced ability to hold sway in both domestic and international affairs.<br><br>This was evident, it says, from the president's failure to push through a new immigration bill, to the scant regard paid to US efforts to influence Israeli-Palestinian developments and Mr Bush's sudden acceptance of the need for action on climate change.<br><br>But a more fundamental loss of clout occurred at a strategic level. "It was evident that exercise of military power - in which, on paper, America dominated the world - had not secured its goal," the survey says. The failings in Iraq created a sense around the world of American power "diminished and demystified", with adversaries believing they will prevail if they manage to draw the US into a prolonged engagement.<br><br>In the Middle East, the survey says, the loss of US influence encouraged some countries - notably Iran - to flex their muscles in the region; it provided ammunition for radical groups seeking to discredit the leaders of countries maintaining solid links with the US; and it encouraged some countries to hedge their diplomatic relations with the US by strengthening their links with other regional powers.<br><br>Washington's ability to act as an honest broker in the world had declined; and Iraq meant the US had failed to pay as much attention as it should have to other parts of the world.<br><br>The report concludes that "the restoration of American strategic authority seemed bound to take much longer than the mere installation of a new president".<br><br>Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2007<br><br><br>
