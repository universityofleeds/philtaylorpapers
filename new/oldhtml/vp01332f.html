Tomlinson, chairman of the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), which operates all of the government's nonmilitary international broadcasting. <br><br>An administration official said the increases were pushed aggressively by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is an ex-officio member of the BBG. <br><br>"The '06 budget and supplemental requests reflect the Bush administration's commitment to international broadcasting, our most effective means of public diplomacy abroad and a critical component of the global war on terror," Mr. Tomlinson said. <br><br>"It's important to remember that in the decade following the end of the Cold War, U.S. spending for international broadcasting was slashed a very real 40 percent," he said. "Now, thanks to President Bush and key supporters in Congress, we are rebuilding from a depleted base and working to get back to where we should be." <br><br>According to VOA plans for the coming year, the supplemental-funding bill will allow its Persian-language satellite-TV programs to expand from daily half-hour broadcasts to one hour "News and Views" newscasts that will be repeated and updated throughout the day, similar to U.S. cable network news programming. <br><br>Funding from the supplemental and next year's budget will result in a significant expansion of VOA's broadcasting to Muslim countries, including Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan, though Iran was expected to be "the chief focus," a VOA official said. <br><br>One of VOA's major antiterrorism broadcasting initiatives that also will benefit from the increased funding is Alhurra, a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week news and feature programming channel beamed into Arab countries across the Middle East. Begun last February, the all-Arab-language service has added a second channel specifically aimed at Iraqi audiences. <br><br>The BBG is an independent federal agency that operates VOA; Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty; Alhurra; Radio Free Asia; Radio and TV Marti, which broadcasts to Cuba; and Radio Sawa, which broadcasts to Arab countries. <br><br><br>
