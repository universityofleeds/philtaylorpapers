At the end of October 2003 immediately before the Self-Defense Forces were dispatched to that country, the government provided the popular TV drama "Oshin" with Arabic subtitles to a local TV station.<br><br>The broadcasting of another popular TV drama, "Project X," started in January. Water trucks given to Musanna State have stickers of the soccer comic Captain Tsubasa (wing), which is popular among Iraqi children.<br><br>Last summer immediately before the Athens Olympic Games, the government invited Iraqi judoka to Japan for intensive training by the Japan Judo Federation. Although Iraq was defeated in the first match, some of its judoka thanked Japan in an interview.<br><br>Seiichi Kondo, director in charge of cultural exchange at the Foreign Ministry, said, "An improved Japanese image will lead to active personal and commodity exchanges."<br><br>Although something similar to the explosive popularity in Japan of Korean TV dramas cannot be expected, Kondo wants to gradually expand the "Japan boom" overseas to narrow the distance between the world and Japan.
