"It was pretty grim stuff. There was mental and physical abuse." <br><br>He added: "It makes you wonder what happens to ordinary Iraqis." <br><br>The US military has so far refused to apologise and has bluntly told Reuters to "drop" its complaint. Major General Charles Swannack, the commander of the 82nd Airborne Division, claimed that two US soldiers had provided sworn evidence that they had come under fire. He admitted, however, that soldiers sometimes had to make "snap judgments". <br><br>"More often than not they are right," he said. <br><br>On January 2 Reuters' Baghdad-based cameraman Salem Ureibi, Falluja stringer Ahmed Mohammed Hussein al-Badrani and driver Sattar Jabar al-Badrani turned up at the crash site where a US Kiowa Warrior helicopter had just been shot down, killing one soldier. <br><br>The journalists were all wearing bulletproof jackets clearly marked "press". They drove off after US soldiers who were securing the scene opened fire on their Mercedes, but were arrested shortly afterwards. <br><br>The soldiers also detained a fourth Iraqi, working for the American network NBC. No weapons were found, the US military admitted. <br><br>Last night the nephew of veteran Reuters driver and latterly cameraman Mr Ureibi said that US troops had forced his uncle to strip naked and had ordered him to put his shoe in his mouth. <br><br>"He protested that he was a journalist but they stuck a shoe in his mouth anyway. They also hurt his leg. One of the soldiers told him: 'If you don't shut up we'll fuck you.'" <br><br>He added: "His treatment was very shameful. He's very sad. He has also had hospital treatment because of his leg." <br><br>Last August a US soldier shot dead another Reuters cameraman, Mazen Dana, after mistaking his camera for a rocket launcher while he filmed outside a Baghdad prison. <br><br>An internal US investigation later cleared him of wrongdoing. During the war last April another of the agency's cameramen, Ukrainian Taras Protswuk, was killed after a US tank fired a shell directly into his room in the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad, from where he had been filming. <br><br>Last night Simon Walker, a spokesman at Reuters head office in London, confirmed that the agency had made a formal complaint to the Pentagon last Friday. <br><br>He said: "We have also complained to the US military. We have complained about the detention [of our staff] and their treatment in detention. We hope it will be dealt with expeditiously." <br><br>A spokeswoman for the US military's coalition press and information centre in Baghdad hung up when the Guardian asked her to comment. <br><br>The top US military spokesman in Iraq, Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt, later admitted that they had received a formal complaint and that there was an on-going investigation into the incident. <br><br>Journalists based in Baghdad have expressed concern that the US military is likely to treat other media employees in Iraq as targets. <br><br><br><br>
