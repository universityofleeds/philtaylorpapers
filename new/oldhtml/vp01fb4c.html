The road to safety begins by ending the aggression. <br><br>Reciprocal treatment is part of justice. <br><br>The incidents that have taken place since the raids on New York and Washington up until now - like the killing of Germans in Tunisia and the French in Karachi, the bombing of the giant French tanker in Yemen, the killing of marines in Failaka [in Kuwait] and the British and Australians in the Bali explosions, the recent operation in Moscow and some sporadic operations here and there - are only reactions and reciprocal actions. <br><br>These actions were carried out by the zealous sons of Islam in defence of their religion and in response to the order of their God and prophet, may God's peace and blessings be upon him. <br><br>White House 'criminals' <br><br>What [US President George] Bush, the pharaoh of this age, was doing in terms of killing our sons in Iraq, and what Israel, the United States' ally, was doing in terms of bombing houses that shelter old people, women and children with US-made aircraft in Palestine were sufficient to prompt the sane among your rulers to distance themselves from this criminal gang. <br><br><br><br>Do your governments not know that the White House gangsters are the biggest butchers of this age? <br> <br>Our kinfolk in Palestine have been slain and severely tortured for nearly a century. <br><br>If we defend our people in Palestine, the world becomes agitated and allies itself against Muslims, unjustly and falsely, under the pretence of fighting terrorism. <br><br>What do your governments want by allying themselves with the criminal gang in the White House against Muslims? <br><br>Do your governments not know that the White House gangsters are the biggest butchers of this age? <br><br>[US Defence Secretary Donald] Rumsfeld, the butcher of Vietnam, killed more than two million people, not to mention those he wounded. <br><br> <br>"If you were distressed by the killing of your nationals in Moscow, remember ours in Chechnya"<br> <br>[US Vice-President Dick] Cheney and [US Secretary of State Colin] Powell killed and destroyed in Baghdad more than Hulegu of the Mongols. <br><br>What do your governments want from their alliance with America in attacking us in Afghanistan? <br><br>I mention in particular Britain, France, Italy, Canada, Germany and Australia. <br><br>We warned Australia before not to join in [the war] in Afghanistan, and [against] its despicable effort to separate East Timor. <br><br>It ignored the warning until it woke up to the sounds of explosions in Bali. <br><br>Its government falsely claimed that they [the Australians] were not targeted. <br><br>'You will be killed' <br><br><br><br>Why should fear, killing, destruction, displacement, orphaning and widowing continue to be our lot, while security, stability and happiness be your lot? <br> <br><br>If you were distressed by the deaths of your men and the men of your allies in Tunisia, Karachi, Failaka, Bali and Amman, remember our children who are killed in Palestine and Iraq everyday, remember our deaths in Khowst mosques and remember the premeditated killing of our people in weddings in Afghanistan. <br><br>If you were distressed by the killing of your nationals in Moscow, remember ours in Chechnya. <br><br>Why should fear, killing, destruction, displacement, orphaning and widowing continue to be our lot, while security, stability and happiness be your lot? <br><br>This is unfair. It is time that we get even. <br><br> <br>The message threatened more attacks from supporters of al-Qaeda<br> <br>You will be killed just as you kill, and will be bombed just as you bomb. <br><br>And expect more that will further distress you. The Islamic nation, thanks to God, has started to attack you at the hands of its beloved sons, who pledged to God to continue jihad, as long as they are alive, through words and weapons to establish right and expose falsehood. <br><br>In conclusion, I ask God to help us champion His religion and continue jihad for His sake until we meet Him while He is satisfied with us. And He can do so. Praise be to Almighty God. <br><br>BBC Monitoring, based in Caversham in southern England, selects and translates information from radio, television, press, news agencies and the Internet from 150 countries in more than 70 languages. <br><br><br>
