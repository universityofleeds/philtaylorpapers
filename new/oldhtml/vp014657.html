<A HREF="http://www.internews.org/mediainconflict/media_peace_full_report.pdf"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=http://www.internews.org/mediainconflict/media_peace_full_report.pdf></A><br><br>About the Report<br>Across the globe, media have been used as tools to inflame grievances and accelerate the escalation towards violent conflict. In Rwanda radio was used to lay the groundwork for genocide. In Serbia television was manipulated to stir ethnic tensions prior to civil war. In the former Soviet republic of Georgia territorial disputes were exacerbated by the propagation of nationalist mythology in the media. <br><br>In light of this historical evidence, Internews Network, which works in 38 countries and fosters pluralistic independent media in emerging democracies and focuses its media development efforts on reducing conflict within and between countries, undertook an analysis of media abuse by actors intent on inciting conflict. The resulting framework, published here, is intended to help media assistance organizations direct media interventions to where they are most needed and can be most beneficial in combating the use of media in promoting conflict. It is based on the belief that robust independent media can play a critical watchdog role in societies vulnerable to civil conflict, but that the capacity of underdeveloped media to resist insidious abuse and manipulation is often limited.<br><br>The analysis was conducted by Mark Frohardt, Internews Network Regional Director for Africa, and Jonathan Temin, Internews Network Program Associate.<br><br>Briefly<br>Conventional media - radio, television and newspapers - usually play a positive and informative role in society. However, there are many documented cases of media being manipulated by actors intent on instigating violent conflict. <br><br>This framework analyzes the role of media in vulnerable societies, defined as societies highly susceptible to movement towards civil conflict and/or repressive rule. <br><br>The framework is designed to enable policymakers to identify societies that may be particularly vulnerable to media abuse while concurrently informing decisions on the most appropriate type and timing of media interventions. <br><br>The authors assert that a number of "clues to conflict" can be observed in the media landscape, clues that suggest a society is vulnerable to abuse by actors intent on instigating conflict, or simply that poor journalism may play a role in precipitating conflict. <br><br>These "clues to conflict" are divided into two categories. "Structural indicators" concern media outlets, media professionals or government institutions concerned with media; they can include media variety and plurality, degree of journalist isolation, and the legal environment for media. "Content indicators" concern content designed to create fear (such as a focus on past atrocities and history of ethnic hatred) or content designed to create a sense of inevitability and resignation to conflict (such as discrediting alternatives to conflict). <br><br>In response to the clues to conflict, a number of "opportunities for intervention" are suggested. These media interventions fall into three categories: "structural interventions," such as strengthening domestic and international journalist networks; "content specific interventions," such as issue-oriented training; and "aggressive interventions," such as radio and television jamming. <br><br>Early interventions are less expensive and more effective than later interventions, because by the time media abuse is widespread there may be little or no recourse. <br><br>Four recommendations to the international community are made: media in vulnerable societies should be monitored; there should be greater collaboration between media organizations and conflict resolution organization; media organizations need to build a better case for monitoring and early intervention and encourage appropriate donor support; and a systematic review of media behavior in vulnerable society should be conducted to enhance the international community's understanding of this important dynamic. <br>Annotated Bibliography<br>Article 19, Broadcasting Genocide: Censorship, Propaganda & State-Sponsored Violence in Rwanda 1990-1994 (London: Article 19, 1996)<br>Thorough account of media behavior prior to genocide, meticulously researched.
