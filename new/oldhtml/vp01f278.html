"No evidence of any Iraqi effort to transfer weapons of mass destruction or weapons to terrorists," Mr Cordesman wrote of Mr Kay's briefing. <br><br>According to the report, details of which were published in the Washington Post yesterday, Mr Kay said that Iraq "did order nuclear equipment from 1999 on, but no evidence [has turned up] of [a] new major facility to use it." <br><br>Mr Kay added that he had located Iraqi biological work "under cover of new agricultural facility" that indicated "advances in developing dry storable powder forms of botulinum toxin". <br><br>The report concluded that 95% of current attacks on coalition forces came from former Saddam loyalists, with some assistance from fighters from Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iran. <br><br>Money looted from the central bank in Iraq in the regime's dying days may be financing the attackers' activities, the report suggested. "At least $1bn [was] still unaccounted for," it said. <br><br>The briefings indicate that Saddam is "cut off, isolated, moving constantly [and has] no real role in control." <br><br>Mr Bremer also told CNN that there was no evidence that Saddam was coordinating the attacks. <br><br><br><br>
