<A HREF="http://www.unicef.org/newsline/super.htm"><img src="link.gif" width=24 height=12 border=0 alt=http://www.unicef.org/newsline/super.htm></A><br><br><br>Superman raises landmine awareness <br><br><br><br>          Monday, 21 October 1996: It's a bird,<br>          it's a plane, it's Superman to the rescue<br>          of children threatened by landmines!<br>          United States First Lady Hillary<br>          Rodham Clinton launched Superman:<br>          Deadly Legacy at a White House<br>          ceremony today featuring the Man of<br>          Steel promoting landmine awareness in<br>          Bosnia and Herzegovina. <br><br>          "Landmines have inflicted death and<br>          enormous pain and suffering on<br>          hundreds of thousands of children over<br>          the last several decades," says UNICEF<br>          Executive Director Carol Bellamy.<br>          "We must do everything in our power to<br>          protect them from these deadly<br>          weapons."<br><br>          DC Comics published the comic book<br>          in cooperation with the US Department<br>          of Defense and UNICEF.<br><br>          Closer to the ground and smaller,<br>          children suffer greater injury and are<br>          more likely to be killed by mines than<br>          adults. Such devices as the 'butterfly'<br>          mine lure children with their attractive,<br>          toy-like appearance. In 68 countries,<br>          where an estimated 110 million<br>          landmines are lodged in the ground,<br>          often long after hostilities have ended,<br>          children pick up or step on the devices<br>          every day while herding animals,<br>          working in the fields or just playing.<br><br>          "I know they look like fun," says<br>          Superman as he sweeps up two boys<br>          before they can pick up a couple of<br>          mines. "But even if they haven't gone<br>          off doesn't mean they won't -- at any<br>          time!" <br><br>          And they do, with appalling frequency.<br>          About 800 people are killed by<br>          landmines every month, 30-40 per cent<br>          of them children. "A landmine is a<br>          perfect soldier," the UNICEF State of<br>          the World's Children 1996 report<br>          quotes a Khmer Rouge general as<br>          saying. "Ever courageous, never sleeps,<br>          never misses." <br><br>          Once laid, an anti-personnel mine can<br>          remain active for as long as 50 years.<br>          And clearing them is no easy task. It's a<br>          laborious, expensive process, with<br>          each mine costing between $300 and<br>          $1,000 a day to clear. Trained workers<br>          have to crawl their way along, probing<br>          the soil inch by inch. <br><br>          Between four and six million land<br>          mines were laid in Bosnia and<br>          Herzegovina and Croatia during the<br>          recent conflict in the former<br>          Yugoslavia.<br><br>          The White House event also highlighted<br>          another project aimed at improving the<br>          lives of children and people of Bosnia<br>          and Herzegovina. A new US Agency<br>          for International Development (USAID)<br>          hospital partnership will link the<br>          Buffalo General Hospital in Buffalo,<br>          New York, with the Tuzla Clinical<br>          Centre in Tuzla, Bosnia and<br>          Herzegovina, for the exchange of<br>          information on effective medical<br>          strategies.<br><br>          The message of Superman: Deadly<br>          Legacy, available in English as well as<br>          in the local scripts of Cyrillic and<br>          Latin, is simple, yet forceful: Children<br>          must learn how to avoid danger zones<br>          where anti-personnel mines are hidden<br>          -- and they don't need Superman to keep<br>          them safe.<br><br>          "They still can be heroes, even without<br>          superpowers," the Man of Steel tells a<br>          crowd of adults and children in the last<br>          frame of the comic book, as he lifts off<br>          for adventures unknown. "The only<br>          superpower they need is the power of<br>          knowledge."<br><br>
