Don't let it take you".<br><br>But critics believe the council's response to the crisis has been slow and fragmented, and that it has been too keen to take orders from the White House rather than developing its own strategy.<br><br>The new team will create campaigns "to inform, involve and inspire" Americans' support for the fight against terrorism, said Mr Sennott.<br><br>The British government is also having to shore up waning public support for the bombing campaign in Afghanistan.<br><br>In a speech today, Tony Blair urged the British people not to forget the sight of the planes flying into the World Trade Centre and the "gloating menace" of Osama bin Laden.<br><br><br><br><br>
