<br>Al-Jazeera goes it alone
<br>
<br> 
<br>Critics say the TV is too loyal to its parent state, Qatar
<br>
<br>By BBC Monitoring's Suzanne Lidster and Mike Rose 
<br>Al-Jazeera (The Peninsula), the popular Arab satellite TV channel, has played a key role in the conflict between the US-led coalition and Afghanistan's ruling Taleban. 
<br>
<br>It is the only foreign broadcaster permitted in Afghanistan. 
<br>
<br>On Sunday, the station aired an exclusive filmed statement by Osama Bin Laden in response to air strikes on Afghanistan. 
<br>
<br>The interview was pre-recorded. 
<br>
<br>And on Friday, it also showed "recent footage" of Bin Laden in Afghanistan. 
<br>
<br> 
<br>The station has also won a following for its coverage of the Palestinian uprising
<br> 
<br>Since 19 September, when the Taleban evacuated the last foreign journalist from the capital Kabul, only two al-Jazeera correspondents and three Afghan reporters working for the Reuters, AFP and AP news agencies have been allowed to stay. 
<br>
<br>The station has a reputation for outspoken, independent reporting - in stark contrast to the Taleban's views of the media as a propaganda and religious tool. Yet it clearly has its uses. 
<br>
<br>For in a country where watching TV or surfing the internet is banned, the Taleban has used al-Jazeera as one way of communicating with the world. 
<br>
<br>Taleban Foreign Ministry officials have spoken via satellite link to the al-Jazeera headquarters in the Gulf state of Qatar. 
<br>
<br>Exclusives 
<br>
<br>The station has scored numerous exclusives. It broadcast the only video pictures of Afghan demonstrators attacking and setting fire to the US embassy on 26 September. 
<br>
<br>And it grabbed international headlines again a few days later with a report that three US special forces troops and two Afghan US citizens had been captured by Bin Laden's al-Qaeda group near the border with Iran. 
<br>
<br>Despite a Taleban denial, al-Jazeera stood by its report, saying that a member of al-Qaeda had called its bureau in Pakistan to announce the capture. 
<br>
<br>Al-Jazeera prides itself on reporting on the Middle East from an Arab perspective while drawing on the professional experience of staff who have worked in the Western media. 
<br>
<br>It has consistently topped viewer ratings in the Middle East and claims 35m viewers. 
<br>
<br>Funding 
<br>
<br>Since its launch in 1996, the channel has relied on funding from the Qatari emirate, advertising and viewer revenue and deals with other broadcasters. It recently signed a deal to broadcast on Sky Digital to the UK and Europe. 
<br>
<br>The channel's popularity stems from its news coverage and lively talk shows on sensitive political, social and even sexual issues. 
<br>
<br> 
<br>The channel says its guiding principles are "diversity of viewpoints and real-time news coverage" 
<br> 
<br>
<br>Al-Jazeera's journalistic scoops have turned the spotlight on the channel. There has been talk of privatisation, but if such a move proceeds, the station could face pressure from commercial sponsors in the Gulf, from where there has often been criticism of its output. 
<br>
<br>However, although state subsidies are expected to end next month, analysts predict that Qatar will continue bankrolling the channel as its controversial reporting could scare off advertisers or shareholders. 
<br>
<br>Despite its independent stance, al-Jazeera has been labelled by some UK newspapers as a "mouthpiece" of Osama Bin Laden and al-Qaeda, and US officials have expressed concern at what it sees as the anti-Western tone of much of its reporting.
