<br>
<br>Chains
<br> 
<br>E: Edmund Blackadder
<br>M: Lord Melchett
<br>Q: Queen Elizabeth I
<br>N: Nursie
<br>B: Baldrick
<br>P: Lord Percy
<br>G(2): German guard(s)
<br>T: Spanish Torturer
<br>L: Prince Ludwig the Indestructible
<br> 
<br> 
<br>The Queen's Chamber
<br> 
<br>E: Get out! Get out, libidinous swine! And take that horse-slut painted
<br>   strumpet with you, where you'll both rot in the filth of your own
<br>   fornication!
<br> 
<br>Q: ...and what did you say to *him*?
<br> 
<br>E: Say, Madam? I said nothing. I simply pulled up my tights and jumped out the
<br>   privy window.
<br> 
<br>Q: Oh, Edmund! You're so naughty!
<br> 
<br>E: Well, I try, Madam. And ten minutes later, when I've got my breath back,
<br>   I try again...  (sticks his tongue out of his grinning mouth)
<br> 
<br>M: Perhaps now we can turn to more important matters of state.
<br> 
<br>Q: Oh, must we?
<br> 
<br>M: I fear so, Ma'am. It's a tragic case -- my old tutor, Lord Forest. His son
<br>   has been kidnapped, and he begs you to help pay the ransom.
<br> 
<br>Q: Edmund, what would you say?
<br> 
<br>E: Well, as you know, Madam, I've had experince of this dreadful situation.
<br>   Only last year my aunt came to me to beg for help in the ransom of my 
<br>   Uncle Ozrick.
<br> 
<br>M: Well, then, you know something of the dreadful pain involved.
<br> 
<br>E: Indeed I do, and can suggest no better answer than the one I gave to 
<br>   her.
<br> 
<br>Q: Which was?
<br> 
<br>E: `Get stuffed.'
<br> 
<br>M: Blackadder, you would jest over a young man's life?
<br> 
<br>E: For `young man' read `young idiot'. Look, anyone stupid enough to let some  
<br>   mustachioed dago come up to them in a corridor, say, `Excuse me Meester,'
<br>   and hit them over the head with a big stick deserves everything they get.
<br>   (leaves)
<br> 
<br>In the Corridor
<br> 
<br>B: Oh, hallo, you're in good fooling this morning.
<br> 
<br>E: Thank you, Baldrick.
<br> 
<br>B: I heard quite an amusing story myself the other day...
<br> 
<br>E: Oh, good. (leaves)
<br> 
<br>(Edmund comes out of the next set of doors and meets a pair of German guards)
<br> 
<br>G: Excuse me, Meister...
<br> 
<br>E: Yes, what is it?
<br> 
<br>(G motions Edmund to G2. Edmund leans over to hear what G2 has to say.
<br> G2 points to the back of Edmund's head, where G hits Edmund over the
<br> head with a big stick)
<br> 
<br>E: I said `What is it?' -- not `Hit me hard on the head wi--' (collapses)
<br> 
<br> 
<br>In the Queen's Chamber
<br> 
<br>Q: You know, Melchy, I've completely changed my mind about that Forest bloke.
<br>   I mean, he's obviously very stupid, but we can't go around punishing
<br>   people for that, can we?
<br> 
<br>M: Certainly not, Ma'am.
<br> 
<br>Q: No -- if we went around punishing people for being stupid, Nursie would
<br>   have been in prison all her life.
<br> 
<br>M: A very piquant observation, Majesty.
<br> 
<br>Q: So I *will* sign this ransom, but it must be the last. (as she writes the
<br>   order) Absolutely the last. Final. Full stop. Never again. Cross my heart
<br>   and hope to die.
<br> 
<br>M: Surely not `hope to die', Majesty.
<br> 
<br>Q: Er, oh, alright, I'll cross that out... Er, here you are. Sorry about the
<br>   smudge.
<br> 
<br>M: Thank you, Ma'am. (leaves)
<br> 
<br>In the Corridor
<br> 
<br>G: Excuse me, Meister...
<br> 
<br>M: Yes?
<br> 
<br>(G motions Melchett to G2. Melchett leans to G2. G2 points. G hits.)
<br> 
<br> 
<br>In a Prison
<br> 
<br>(Edmund wakes up; Melchett is with him. They are tied back-to-back.)
<br> 
<br>E: Oh, God, God, God. What on Earth was I drinking last night? My head feels
<br>   like there's a Frenchman living in it. (looks around) Where am I?
<br> 
<br>M: (groans) Ooohhhh...
<br> 
<br>E: Who's there?
<br> 
<br>M: It is I: Melchett.
<br> 
<br>E: Melchett! You really ought to get this house of yours cleaned up, you know.
<br>   It's a real mess!
<br> 
<br>M: This is no time for jokes, Blackadder! We've been kidnapped!
<br> 
<br>E: Oh, God... How incredibly embarrassing!
<br> 
<br>M: As private parts to the gods are we! They play with us for their sport!
<br> 
<br>(insane laughter of Spanish Torturer)
<br> 
<br>E: (as though he's about to meet someone stupid) Oh, God, who's that?
<br> 
<br>T: (leans to Melchett, says something in Spanish)
<br> 
<br>E: Just wait a minute! If anyone is going to be spoken to around here, it's
<br>   going to be me, alright? Tell him, Melchy.
<br> 
<br>M: Certainly.  (points behind him, to Edmund, as he and Edmund wiggle around
<br>   so Edmund faces T)  Parlo con lui -- no mio (something) -- parlo con lui.
<br> 
<br>T: Ah, bueno. (looks at Edmund) El Je'fe! (Says same thing he said to
<br>    Melchett)
<br> 
<br>E: Ah, that's better. (pause) Now, what's he saying?
<br> 
<br>M: He says he would like a word with you.
<br> 
<br>E: Uh huh. Anything else?
<br> 
<br>M: Yes. He says he would like to torture you as well.
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Later.  Edmund, in a small box with his head, arms and legs sticking out
<br>(legs shackeled as well), is alone in the prison with T.  T is turning
<br>a key in the box presumably to move spikes into Edmund's body.
<br> 
<br>E: Right. Now, am I, by any chance, addressing a senior dignitary of the
<br>   Spanish Inquisition?
<br> 
<br>T: Te gusta, la (??) de la Inquisicion!
<br> 
<br>E: (not understanding a word)  Good... Because, if I am, I wish to make it
<br>   quite clear that I am prepared to tell you absolutely *anything*.
<br> 
<br>T: Habla puer(??)
<br> 
<br>E: No speako dago. I demand to see the British ambassador, *understand*?
<br> 
<br>T: (winding some more) Necesito silencio para comesa.
<br> 
<br>E: Oh for God's sake! Look, how can you question me if you don't speak English?
<br> 
<br>T: No! *Yo* pregunto las questionnes!
<br> 
<br>E: Alright, let's start with the basics. English is a non-inflected
<br>   Indo-European language derived from dialects of....
<br> 
<br> 
<br>In the corridor outside Queen's Chamber
<br> 
<br>(Queenie and Percy are playing frisbee)
<br> 
<br>P: (catches, holds the disc up triumphantly) How's that!
<br> 
<br>Q: Percy, who's Queen?
<br> 
<br>P: (drops disc) Whoops! Butterfingers! 
<br> 
<br>Q: Ah, so I win again.
<br> 
<br>P: Yes. Well done, Your Majesty!
<br> 
<br>(They enter the throne room. Nursie is feeding Baldrick by hand.)
<br> 
<br>Q: There's definitely been no sign of Edmund.
<br> 
<br>P: I fear not, Ma'am.
<br> 
<br>Q: Why (??) he vanished? Simply vanished...
<br> 
<br>P: Like an old oak table...
<br> 
<br>Q: *Vanished*, Lord Percy -- not *varnished*.
<br> 
<br>P: Forgive me, My Lady, but my Uncle Bertram's old oak table completely 
<br>   vanished. 'Twas on the night of the great Stepney fire. And on that
<br>   same terrible night, his house and all his other things completely
<br>   vanished too. So did he, in fact. It was a most perplexing mystery.
<br> 
<br>Q: Lord Percy?
<br> 
<br>P: Yes?
<br> 
<br>Q: It's up to you: either you can shut up, or you can have your head cut off.
<br> 
<br>P: (squints, thinks very long and hard about it) I'll shut up.
<br> 
<br> 
<br>In the Prison
<br> 
<br>(Edmund and Torturer play charades in an attempt to communicate)
<br> 
<br>T: Bastardo!
<br> 
<br>E: Baa-taar-do...  Barrister.
<br> 
<br>T: Bastardo!
<br> 
<br>E: Embarrassing. You're embarrassing. *I'm* embarrassing.
<br> 
<br>(T clenches his fist, and curls his left arm underneath his right, and
<br> points it straight up in a familiar gesture.)
<br> 
<br>E: Er, er, rogering!
<br> 
<br>(T makes a very-fat gesture over his abomen.)
<br> 
<br>E: Er, pregnant!
<br> 
<br>(T acts like he's cradling a baby, and makes little baby noises.)
<br> 
<br>E: Baby! Baby!
<br> 
<br>(T acts like he has tossed the baby.)
<br> 
<br>E: Bathwater!
<br> 
<br>(T shakes his head, then holds his ear.)
<br> 
<br>E: Sounds like... oh! `Bastard'!
<br> 
<br>T: (excited at Edmund's correct guess) Si'! Si'!! No este terminado. Hijo.
<br>    Hijo!
<br> 
<br>E: (not knowing that `hijo' is a word, guesses by the sound of it) Donkey.
<br> 
<br>(T shakes his head, puts his head in his hand.)
<br> 
<br>T: (holds his hand horzontally above his head) Padre.
<br> 
<br>E: Big bastard...
<br> 
<br>T: (lowers the hand to a very short height) Hijo.
<br> 
<br>E: Little bastard.
<br> 
<br>T: (walking masculinely, speaks deeply) Padre...
<br> 
<br>E: Man...
<br> 
<br>T: (bends his knees as he walks and makes baby-like noises again) Hijo.
<br> 
<br>E: Boy.  Man, father... Oh! `Son'! I'm a bastard's son.
<br> 
<br>T: (gets on his hands and knees) Perra! (pants)
<br> 
<br>E: Thirsty... Thirsty bastard.
<br> 
<br>(T barks)
<br> 
<br>E: Thirsty barking bastard. Oh, `dog'! Dog. Right, dog.
<br> 
<br>(T, on his knees, moves his hands to indicate breasts.)
<br> 
<br>E: Woman.
<br> 
<br>(T goes back on his hands and knees.)
<br> 
<br>E: Dog. 
<br> 
<br>(T does the breast gesture again.)
<br> 
<br>E: Woman, dog...*bitch*! I'm a bastard son of a bitch!
<br> 
<br>T: Si'!!! Si'!!! (shakes Edmund's hand)
<br> 
<br>E: In that case, you are a fornicating babboon.
<br> 
<br>T: Que?
<br> 
<br>E: Oh dear. Er, *you*...
<br> 
<br>T: (points to Edmund) Tu? (sees Edmund is pointing at him, so he points
<br>    at himself) Yo...
<br> 
<br>E: You, er, fornicating... Yes... I can't really do it in this box...
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Later...
<br> 
<br>T: ...tus testiculos.
<br> 
<br>E: My, um, ah yes, those, yes...
<br> 
<br>T: ...sobre un fuego grande.
<br> 
<br>E: ...over a large...
<br> 
<br>T: Fuego, fuego. (makes fire motion with his hands, then blows on the tips
<br>    of his fingers)
<br> 
<br>E: Oh, fire, fire. Ah good, so let's recap. Um...if I admit that I'm in love--
<br> 
<br>T: (interjects) No! No! (rolls onto his back)
<br> 
<br>E: Sorry -- head-over-heels in love -- (T makes various motions to indicate
<br>   each thing) with Satan and all his little wizards, then you will remove my
<br>   testicles with a blunt instrument--
<br> 
<br>T: Una (polan~a?), una polan~a.
<br> 
<br>E: ...resembling some kind of gardening tool but we can't quite (obscured by
<br>   laughter). Um, and roast them over a large fire.
<br> 
<br>T: Si', si'.
<br> 
<br>E: Whereas if I don't admit that I'm in love with Satan and...and...all his...
<br>   his little wizards, (T again is making appropriate gestures for each item)
<br>   you will hold me upside down in a vat of warm marmalade.
<br> 
<br>T: (holds his hands out, expecting more) ...*y*...
<br> 
<br>E: *And* remove my testicles with a blunt...oh I see. Well, well, in that case,
<br>   I love Satan.
<br> 
<br>T: (excited) Ohh ho ho! (produces instrument)
<br> 
<br>E: Oh, it's a *scythe*...
<br> 
<br> 
<br>In the Queen's Chamber
<br> 
<br>Q: Oh, I don't know, I've looked everywhere.
<br> 
<br>P: (with a finger to his temple as though he's being psychic)
<br>   Perhaps...they're not...hiding...at all! Perhaps...they've been...
<br>   kidnapped!
<br> 
<br>Q: Nonsense! ...what Edmund said: `Only real idiots get kidnapped'.
<br> 
<br>P: (frightened) Do they?! (looks around nervously for kidnappers)
<br> 
<br> 
<br>In the Prison
<br> 
<br>(T is holding his scythe, ready to have a go at Edmund. Prince Ludwig
<br> enters, shouts `Stop!' and whips T down, who screams a bit and remains
<br> cowering.)
<br> 
<br>L: Forgive me, Herr Blackadder. I have been neglecting my duties as a host.
<br>   Please accept my appoloaggies.
<br> 
<br>E: I accept nothing from a man who imprisons his guests in a commode.
<br> 
<br>L: I hope this scum (T burbles a bit) has not inconweenienced you.
<br> 
<br>E: It takes more than a maniac trying to cut off my goolies to inconweenience
<br>   *me*. 
<br> 
<br>L: Good. If he had inconweenienced you, I was going to offer you his tongue.
<br> 
<br>E: Believe me, sir: if he had inconweeniened me, you would not have a tongue
<br>   with which to make such an offer.
<br> 
<br>L: Let me assure you, Herr Blackadder: if I no longer had a tongue with which 
<br>   to make such an offer, you would no longer have a tongue with which to tell 
<br>   me that, if I had inconweenienced you, I would no longer have a tongue with 
<br>   which to offer you his tongue.
<br> 
<br>E: Yes, well, enough of this banter. Who the hell are you, sausage breath?
<br> 
<br>L: You do not remember me then, Herr Blackadder?
<br> 
<br>E: I don't believe I had the pleasure.
<br> 
<br>L: Oh, on the contrary. We have met many times, although you knew me by
<br>   another name. Do you recall a mysterious black marketeer and smuggler
<br>   called Otto with whom you used to dine and plot and play the biscuit game
<br>   at the Old Pizzle in Dover?
<br> 
<br>E: My God!
<br> 
<br>L: Yes! I was the waitress.
<br> 
<br>E: (shocked) I don't believe it! *You*? Big Sally?
<br> 
<br>L: (falsetto) `Will you have another piece of pie, My Lord?'
<br> 
<br>E: ...but I went to bed with you, didn't I?
<br> 
<br>L: For my country, I am willing to make any sacrifice.
<br> 
<br>E: Yes, but I'm not! I must have been paralytic!
<br> 
<br>L: Indeed you were, Mr. Floppy...
<br> 
<br>E: Yes, alright, alright (obscured by laughter). Now, would you mind--
<br> 
<br>L: (again falsetto) `Such a disappointment for a girl...'
<br> 
<br>E: Yes, alright, you've had your little joke.
<br> 
<br>L: `It really doesn't matter -- we'll try again in a few minutes. Have a look
<br>   through these naughty parchments.'
<br> 
<br>E: Oh, yes, we *are* proud of our comic serving-wench voice, aren't we? Just
<br>   because we can say `Zur' instead of `Sir', (??) sense at all social
<br>   gatherings the tedious little turd who keeps putting on amusing voices. 
<br> 
<br>L: (angered, shouts) Be quiet!
<br> 
<br>E: What else have you got in your outstandingly inventive repertoire, I 
<br>   wonder...  Aaah, a brilliant drunk Glaswegian, no doubt.  An hilarious 
<br>   black man: `See you, Jimmy, where am dat watty-melon'. (obscured by
<br>   laughter) I can't wait for your side-splitting poof and that funny little
<br>   croaky one who isn't anyone in particular, but he's such a scream. And
<br>   most of all, I like the one you do all the time, that fatheaded German
<br>   chamberpot standing in front of me.
<br> 
<br>L: You know, you talk too much, Blackadder. I think it's a case of werbal
<br>   diarrhoea that you are having. I should, perhaps, tell you that I have
<br>   given the Queen only a week to reply to my ransom demand. Unless she
<br>   pays up, you die. Howwibly.
<br> 
<br>E: She will pay up. And then within a week, you die. Howwibly howwibly.
<br> 
<br>L: You find yourself amusing, Blackadder.
<br> 
<br>E: I try not to fly in the face of public opinion.
<br> 
<br>L: You know, I think, I think that a week from now, you'll be less in the 
<br>   mood for being amusing.
<br> 
<br>E: At least when I *am* in the mood, I *can* be amusing.
<br> 
<br>L: Then choose your next witticism carefully, Herr Blackadder; it may be
<br>   your last.  Guards, fetch his friend.
<br> 
<br>Gs: (enter with Melchett) Ein, zwei, ein, zwei...
<br> 
<br>M: (crying, expecting to be thrown into a very deep pit)
<br>   Oh no, please! (they throw him down) oooohhh! (he lands on the lower
<br>   level, about three feet below, and looks rather surprised)
<br> 
<br>L: Lord Melchett, we meet again.
<br> 
<br>M: No, I don't think we've had the pleasure...
<br> 
<br>L: You do not recognise me, then?
<br> 
<br>M: No...
<br> 
<br>L: Let me refresh your memory. You remember when you were in Cornwall; at the
<br>   monastery, there was an old shepherd with whom you used to talk.
<br> 
<br>M: Good Lord! Dimkins?
<br> 
<br>L: Yes! I was one of his sheep.
<br> 
<br>M: One of his sheep?  Not...?
<br> 
<br>L: Yes!
<br> 
<br>M: Flossy?
<br> 
<br>L: Yes!
<br> 
<br>M: But didn't we...?  (waves his hands in an exchanging fashion)
<br> 
<br>L: Yes, Lord Melchett! BBBAAAAA!
<br> 
<br>M: Oh my God!
<br> 
<br>L: But enough of such pleasant reminiscences, eh? The guard has found an
<br>   interesting document in your clothing.
<br> 
<br>M: Oh, I shouldn't pay much attention to that if I were you.
<br> 
<br>L: The Queen says that she will pay only one ransom, `But it must be the 
<br>   last. Absolutely the last. Final. Full stop. Never again. Cross my 
<br>   heart and hope to be spanked until my bottom goes purple.' She has a
<br>   difficult choice in front of her, has she not?
<br> 
<br>E: Not really. Bad luck, Melchers. Still... Life -- huh! -- overrated,
<br>   I reckon.
<br> 
<br>L: Yes, gentlemen. Well, if you excuse me, I have work to do. Evil plots
<br>   don't just make themselves you know. (exits laughing, the guards join
<br>   in)
<br> 
<br> 
<br>In the Queen's Chamber
<br> 
<br>P: (reading a note from Ludwig; oddly, as he reads it, he has an accent like
<br>    Ludwig's)
<br>      Dear Qveen, 
<br>      I, evil Prince Ludvig the Indestructible, have your two friends, and you
<br>      must shoose between zem. The ransom is one million crona. Many many
<br>      appoloaggies for the inconweenience.
<br> 
<br>Q: Oh, my goodness! What a difficult choice!
<br> 
<br>N: But it isn't the first difficult choice you've ever had to make, my little
<br>   tadpole.
<br> 
<br>Q: No, that's true.
<br> 
<br>N: In the old days, it was all difficult choices. Should you have Nursie
<br>   Milk or Moo Cow Milk? Of course, it was always Nursie milk, ha-ha.
<br>   But then left breasty-dumpling or right breasty-dumpling? Of course, it
<br>   was always both breasty-dumplings, ha-ha. Aah, but then which one first?
<br> 
<br>Q: Shut up, Nursie! Ahh, this is very confusing. Lord Percy, play a while 
<br>   to calm my spirits.
<br> 
<br>P: (holding a lute) Certainly, Ma'am.  (gives the lute to Baldrick)
<br>   Patty-cake, patty-cake, baker's man. Ah-ha, you're it! Ring-a-ring o'
<br>   rosey, all fall down.  (appropriate movements accompany all those)
<br> 
<br>(Queen is speechless; shakes her head.)
<br> 
<br> 
<br>In the Prison
<br> 
<br>M: What say you, Blackadder, I sing a song to keep our spirits up?
<br> 
<br>E: That all depends on whether you want the slop-bucket over your head or not.
<br> 
<br>M: Well, perhaps some pleasant word game.
<br> 
<br>E: Yes, alright. Make a sentence out of the following words: face, sodding,
<br>   your, shut.
<br> 
<br>M: For God's sake, man! We must do something to relieve our minds of the 
<br>   terrible fate that awaits us!!
<br> 
<br>E: Awaits you, Melchy -- not me. How's my beard looking?
<br> 
<br>M: Alas! Shall I ever see England more? Her rolling fields, Her swooping
<br>   swallows...
<br> 
<br>E: ...and Her playful sheep.
<br> 
<br>(enter Ludwig)
<br> 
<br>E: Ah, about time, too!
<br> 
<br>L: Gentlemen, the answer has arrived.
<br> 
<br>E: Well, thank God; I'm sick of this place. The conditions are just
<br>   disgraceful! Why, it's like a prison in here!
<br> 
<br>L: I shall read it to you.
<br> 
<br>E: Ah, typical master criminal -- loves the sound of his own voice...
<br> 
<br>L: After long and very careful deliberation, the Queen has decided to extend
<br>   the ransom money on....
<br> 
<br>(cut to Queen writing this very letter)
<br> 
<br>Q: ...a big party. Just impossible to decide between my two faves, so I've
<br>   decided to keep the cash, have a whizzy-jolly time and try to forget both
<br>   of you. Hope you're not too miffed. Byeeeeee!
<br> 
<br>(cut to prison)
<br> 
<br>E: WHAT?!
<br> 
<br>L: `Hope you're not too miffed. Byeeeeee!' Well, as you can imagine, my
<br>   friends, this makes me very unhappy.
<br> 
<br>E: (sarcastically) Oh, I am sorry.
<br> 
<br>L: But if you gentlemen were to tell me a way to, let us say, gain access to 
<br>   your queen, I might just be able to commute your deaths to a life sentence.
<br> 
<br>E: Are you suggesting we betray her?
<br> 
<br>L: Oh yes.
<br> 
<br>E: Alright.
<br> 
<br>M: Blackadder! What are you saying? What of loyalty? honour? self-respect?
<br> 
<br>E: What of them?
<br> 
<br>M: Nothing...
<br> 
<br>L: So you will both play ball?
<br> 
<br>M & E: Yep.
<br> 
<br>L: Oh, what joy. See how you collapse before me you great and incorruptible
<br>   English knobs. So proud of your great big stiff upper lips, hmm?
<br> 
<br>E: Gloating is a sign of insecurity, Ludwig -- shove it. Now, do you want to
<br>   know how to get to the Queen or not?
<br> 
<br>L: Yes, I thought some kind of disguise. You know, I do a very good Mary,
<br>   Queen of Scots. (turns away, rustles his hair, raises his shoulders and
<br>   turns back to them, speaking in falsetto very thick Scottish dialect
<br>   (actually this voice is not that of the actor, but is a woman's voice))
<br>   `Hoots, mon! Whar's me heid?'
<br> 
<br> 
<br>In the Queen's Chamber (Baldrick is eating from a dog dish that Queen holds.)
<br> 
<br>Q: What sort of party should it be?
<br> 
<br>P: Oh, fancy dress. I love fancy dress.
<br> 
<br>Q: Nursie?
<br> 
<br>N: I think it should be one of those ones where everybody comes with 
<br>   nothing on at all.
<br> 
<br>Q: Shut up, then. (to Percy) I agree with you, Acting Lord Chamberlain.
<br>   If we're really to forget our woes, then we should have as much fun 
<br>   as possible. And what can be more fun than a party where people come
<br>   dressed as frogs and rabbits and nuns? 
<br> 
<br>N: ...and bits of wood!
<br> 
<br>Q: You're not going to come as a bit of wood.
<br> 
<br>N: Aren't I?
<br> 
<br>Q: No!
<br> 
<br>N: Ah. Well, how about a pencil, then? Should I come as a pencil?
<br> 
<br>Q: Don't be silly, Nursie. You always talk like this and you always end
<br>   up coming as the same thing.
<br> 
<br>N: Do I?
<br> 
<br>Q: Yes, you know-- of co-- everybo-- (gives up. addresses Baldrick) Lassie,
<br>   what does Nursie always come to fancy-dress parties dressed as?
<br> 
<br>B: I thought everybody knew.
<br> 
<br>Q: Yes -- everybody, apparently, except Nursie.  Tell her.
<br> 
<br>B: She always comes as a cow.
<br> 
<br>N: Yes, that's right! A lovely lovely cow with great big lovely udders.
<br>   I swiggle around going `Mmmoooooo! Come to Nursie Cow, you lovely 
<br>   little heifers!' (Percy doesn't find this very appealing)
<br>   Oh yes! What fun! Oh, I want to be a cow again, please?
<br> 
<br>Q: Shut up. (to Percy) Isn't Nursie stupid?
<br> 
<br>P: She certainly is, Ma'am. (forced laugh)
<br> 
<br>Q: You see? We're having a good time already! We've completely forgotten about
<br>   those chaps in prison, haven't we?  (spoken in a tone with which -- and she
<br>   looks around like -- no one should dare disagree)
<br> 
<br>P: (gets a joke in his head; seems rather pleased; puts on a fake curious face)
<br>   What chaps?
<br> 
<br>all: Pbbbbffffff!!!!!!!
<br> 
<br> 
<br>In the Prison
<br> 
<br>(Guards enter with Ludwig)
<br> 
<br>Gs: Ein, zwei, ein zwei...
<br> 
<br>L: My friends, I come to bid you farewell. These guards will eventually
<br>   die of old age, but their sons will, I'm sure, go on attending to your
<br>   needs.
<br> 
<br>E: Thank you for your concern, but, in fact, we intend to escape.
<br> 
<br>L: With your information, gentlemen, I intend to bring down your Queen and 
<br>   country. The Master of Disguise will become the Master of the World!
<br>   (turns to leave, laughing maniacally)
<br> 
<br>E: Yes, er, one thing, Ludwig, just before you go...
<br> 
<br>L: What?
<br> 
<br>E: Were you ever bullied at school?
<br> 
<br>L: (a bit defensive) What do you mean?
<br> 
<br>E: Well, all this ranting and raving about power -- there must be some reason
<br>   for it.
<br> 
<br>L: Nonsense! No, er, at my school, having dirty hair and spots was a sign of
<br>   maturity!
<br> 
<br>E: I thought so... and I'll bet your mother made you wear shorts right up to
<br>   your final year!  (the guards look at each other for a moment in reaction)
<br> 
<br>L: Shut up! Shut up! When I am King of England, no one will ever dare call 
<br>   me Shorty-Greasy-Spot-Spot again!  (the guards again look up a bit
<br>   surprised at this news. Ludwig and guards leave)
<br> 
<br>E: Touched a nerve there, I think...
<br> 
<br>M: What good is it going to do us if we're doomed to rot here until we die?
<br> 
<br>E: Nah, don't worry, I've got a plan.
<br> 
<br>M: Really?
<br> 
<br>E: Yes. Now that Ludwig's gone, we should no trouble overcoming the guards.
<br>   Germans are sticklers for efficiency and I've been watching their routine.
<br>   I've selected the moment when they're at their most vulnerable. That is
<br>   when we will attack them.
<br> 
<br>M: Brilliant! How?
<br> 
<br>E: That is the most cunning bit... (sticks his tongue out slyly)
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Later
<br> 
<br>(Guards approach)
<br> 
<br>Gs: (in background) Ein, zwei, ein zwei...
<br> 
<br>E: Right, now this is it. Don't forget, when they are at their most *vulner-
<br>   able*.
<br> 
<br>Gs: Ein, zwei...Halt! Jingle the keys: (keys jingle) Open the door! 
<br>    (door opens) Greetings to the prisoners: (they take one step in, and
<br>    wave) Guten abend, Englander-scum! March to the table: Ein
<br>    zwei, ein zwei, ein zwei...Halt! Food on the table: ein zwei! (they
<br>    put down a loaf of bread and a sausage). Spit on the food: ein zwei!
<br>    Insulting further gestures to the prisoners: ein zwei, ein zwei! (they
<br>    do pelvic thrusts)
<br> 
<br>E: Now! (E & M hit their groins)
<br> 
<br>Gs: OOOOHHH!
<br> 
<br>E: (shaking out his hand) Trust me to get the hard one! (They head for the
<br>   stairs. Edmund grabs Melchett and throws him off the stairs, so he can
<br>   leave first.)
<br> 
<br> 
<br>In the Queen's Chamber
<br> 
<br>Q: (dressed as Henry VIII, complete with beard; speaks as deeply as she can)
<br>   Yo ho ho! Off with their heads!
<br> 
<br>P: Ma'am, it is brilliant! Your father is born again!
<br> 
<br>Q: Bally well hope not, or else I won't be Queen anymore! Er, yours is a
<br>   pretty good, too. What is it?
<br> 
<br>P: It's nothing, Ma'am -- just a mere trifle I threw together.
<br> 
<br>Q: Doesn't look much like a trifle. Looks more like a fruit salad to me.
<br> 
<br>P: I see Nursie's really excelled herself.
<br> 
<br>N: MMMMMOOOOOOOOOO!
<br> 
<br>Q: Yes, she has. (looks down at Baldrick, who has a pencil up each nostril)
<br>   I'm not sure about this, though.  What are you meant to be?
<br> 
<br>B: A pencil case.
<br> 
<br>Q: (ecstatically) Yes! Oh, it's just like parties I had when I was tiny.
<br>   We had tea and cakes and venison, and then a trip with a couple of little 
<br>   friends to the executions!
<br> 
<br>P: How sweet.
<br> 
<br>Q: ...if I *wanted* my little friends executed, that is. Oh, how I do wish
<br>   Edmund could be here. He always loved parties, and always always wore
<br>   very very tight tights.
<br> 
<br>P: (thinking the same dumb joke can work twice)  Edmund who?
<br> 
<br>(Edmund enters)
<br> 
<br>E: Edmund Blackadder!
<br> 
<br>Q: Oh!
<br> 
<br>E: Majesty...
<br> 
<br>Q: (removing her beard) Oh, Edmund! But...
<br> 
<br>E: Did you ever know me to miss a party?
<br> 
<br>Q: (excited, then serious) But what about Lord Melchett?
<br> 
<br>E: Yes... Unfortunately, Ma'am, he made it too.
<br> 
<br>(Melchett enters)
<br> 
<br>P: Rapture! Joy beyond measure! Bliss (kisses her hand) which cannot
<br>   be counted on one's fingers!
<br> 
<br>E: (softly) Bbaaaaa...
<br> 
<br>Q: Sorry, Edmund?
<br> 
<br>E: Nothing...
<br> 
<br>Q: Yes, um, unfortunately, apart from my nose getting a little prettier,
<br>   nothing much has changed around here. (motions to Baldrick, who is gnawing
<br>   on a large bone) Your animal still isn't house-trained, Percy's still
<br>   unemployed, and Nursie's one stick short of a bundle.
<br> 
<br>N: MMMMOOOOOOOOO!
<br> 
<br>E: Ah, yes. Thank you for reminding me. (takes his sword out and stabs
<br>   the cow)
<br> 
<br>Q: Nursie! (to Edmund) You killed Nursie! (downplayed) Oh, that's horrid...
<br>   (shouts again) Guards! Guards! Take him away and execute him! He's killed
<br>   Nursie!
<br> 
<br>N: (entering from the hall, wearing a multi-uddered, horrible cow costume;
<br>   not wearing the head) Can anyone help me with my udders?
<br> 
<br>Q: Nursie?
<br> 
<br>N: Yes?
<br> 
<br>E: Yes, and may I introduce you to our erstwhile captor, Prince Ludwig
<br>   the Indestructible! (removes the cow head from Ludwig in the good cow
<br>   costume)
<br> 
<br>(all gasp)
<br> 
<br>L: Ah, Queen Elizabeth, we meet again. 
<br> 
<br>Q: Er, no, I don't think so, actually.
<br> 
<br>L: Yes -- you remember when you were young; your father used to take you 
<br>   riding on a magnificent grey pony that you used to kiss and fondle
<br>   in the stable yard. (Queen is embarrassed and motions for him to pass
<br>   that bit.)  *I*, I was the tall and attractive German stable lad who
<br>   held him.
<br> 
<br>Q: No!
<br> 
<br>L: Yes!
<br> 
<br>Q: You?
<br> 
<br>L: Uh-huh.
<br> 
<br>Q: Shorty-Greasy-Spot-Spot??
<br> 
<br>L: (stands, shouts) No! No, no, no! You will -- all of you -- regret the day
<br>   that you have mocked my complexion. (rushes to the hallway)
<br>   I shall return and vreak my rewenghee! (laughs maniacally, sets about
<br>   opening the outer doors)
<br> 
<br>E: No -- you will die and be buried. (Edmund throws a large knife into the
<br>   hallway. There is a thunk, and a brief scream from Ludwig.)
<br> 
<br>all: Hurray!
<br> 
<br>E: (calmly) ...strange man.
<br> 
<br>Q: But how did you know it was him?
<br> 
<br>E: This was the information with which we bought our lives. We told him 
<br>   that, if the Queen was having a party, Nursie always goes as a cow.
<br>   From that moment, he was doomed. All we had to do was escape, return,
<br>   and kill the cow.
<br> 
<br>Q: How could you be sure it was not Nursie?
<br> 
<br>E: Because, My Lady, Ludwig was a master of disguise, whereas Nursie is a 
<br>   sad, insane old woman with a udder fixation. All we had to do was kill
<br>   the one that *looked like* the cow. That was the mistake I knew that
<br>   Ludwig would make. His disguise was too good!
<br> 
<br>Q: Gosh, Edmund! How brilliant! Welcome home.
<br> 
<br>E: Well, I must say, Ma'am, it's good to be back. 
<br> 
<br>P: Welcome, Edmund. Did you...miss me?
<br> 
<br>E: I certainly did. Many was the time, Percy, I said to myself, `I wish Percy
<br>   was here--
<br> 
<br>(Percy embraces Edmund)
<br> 
<br>E: `...being tortured instead of me.'
<br> 
<br>P: Gah, we have missed your wit!
<br> 
<br>B: Did you miss me, My Lord?
<br> 
<br>E: Ermmm... `Baldrick', is it?
<br> 
<br>B: That's right.
<br> 
<br>E: No, not really.
<br> 
<br>Q: And me... did you miss me, Edmund?
<br> 
<br>E: Madam, life without you was like...a broken pencil.
<br> 
<br>Q: (confused) Explain...?
<br> 
<br>E: Pointless.

<br>A low-toned bell rings. We see Percy, Edmund, Queen, Nursie, Baldrick,
<br>and Melchett. All are dead with slit throats.
<br> 
<br>Prince Ludwig is disguised as Queen, and is holding a knife.
<br>(Actually using the actress with the actor's voice dubbed in).
<br> 
<br>L: (laughs) Now *this* is a disguise I'm *really* going to
<br>   enjoy!  If I can just get the voice right...
