<br>US needs to match the Chinese in diplomacy
<br>
<br>By Earl Carr
<br>
<br>Tuesday, Jan 27, 2004,Page 8 
<br>
<br>
<br>This month marks the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and the US. Because of America's global presence, China's relationship with it is, as President Hu Jintao (á&ä) put it, the "central thread in China's foreign policy strategy."
<br>
<br>The US plays an integral role in China's foreign policy. However, China has and will continue to assert its independence through other diplomatic channels. China's effective diplomatic strategy has allowed it to consolidate its influence in Asia. The US must therefore implement a new public diplomacy strategy aimed at preserving core geo-strategic and national interests in Asia.
<br>
<br>Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's («¶ö) visit to the US last month was consistent with China's foreign policy objectives: strengthening relations with the US is paramount, furthering relations with the developing world is of lesser importance. 
<br>
<br>In a highly interdependent global economy, Beijing needs the US just as the US needs China.
<br>
<br>Wen's meeting with US President George Bush was the third meeting between Chinese and US leaders last year. At Wen's arrival ceremony, Bush was in rare form, smiling and leading Wen near crowds braving freezing temperatures. 
<br>
<br>This was in stark contrast to the Bush administration threatening to slap trade sanctions on Chinese textiles, TV and iron-fitting products in November. The sudden change in relations demonstrates the importance both countries place on maintaining political and economic stability.
<br>
<br>The Chinese Communist Party has staked its legitimacy on attracting higher levels of foreign direct investment and increasing overall economic growth. To do this, Beijing must continue to improve its relations both with the US and other key economic powers.
<br>
<br>Robust economic growth, combined with effective diplomacy, has immeasurably improved China's international image. Because of this, China's diplomatic engagement has important implications for the US. 
<br>
<br>As a growing economic and military power, China is perfectly positioned in Asia. It now acts as a vital mediator between the US and North Korea. In addition, China's relations with South Korea are better than they are with the US. ASEAN now looks at China as an important economic and political lifeline.
<br>
<br>But China's diplomacy also has important implications for US interests in the region, such as Taiwan. China has prevented Taiwan from entering the UN and from obtaining observer status in the World Health Organization. Even more surprisingly, because of strong pressure from Beijing, Bush went so far as to tell President Chen Shui-bian (s4A) not to hold a referendum.
<br>
<br>The US must recognize that while China is dependent on the US for its export markets and foreign direct investment, Bei-jing has and will continue to assert its independence through diplomatic channels. 
<br>
<br>Beijing has become very effective in using this "soft power" to consolidate its influence in Asia.
<br>
<br>The US needs to embark on an aggressive public diplomacy strategy, de-emphasizing the "war on terror," and increasing state-level contact between the US and traditional Asian allies. It must also devote more resources to international student exchanges to improve trust and understanding at the grass-roots level. 
<br>
<br>Failure to improve America's image in Asia will lead to a weaker presence there and a smaller overall influence in the region.
<br>
