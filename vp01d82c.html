The others<br> hadn't been born yet. I'm not sure of the exact years of the Prince Regent.)<br> <br>(The words in the gobbledygook scene here are best guesses. Nearly all of<br> them have been looked up in dictionaries -- or at least the parts of them<br> have. Anyone with a closed-caption decoder who can help with the words,<br> though, please do.)<br> <br> <br>In Prince's House (in bedchamber)<br> <br>G: (wakes, shouts) Oh, oh, oh, Blackadder!  BLACKADDER!<br> <br>E: (enters) Your Highness.<br> <br>G: Wha--wha--what time is it?<br> <br>E: Three o'clock in the afternoon, Your Highness.<br> <br>G: Oh, thank God for that; I thought I'd overslept.<br> <br>E: I trust you had a pleasant evening, sir...?<br> <br>G: Well, no, actually. The most extraordinary thing happened. Last night,<br>   I was having a bit of a snack at the Naughty Hellfire Club, and some	<br>   fellow said that I had the wit and sophistication of a donkey.<br> <br>E: Oh, an absurd suggestion, sir.<br> <br>G: You're right, it is absurd.<br> <br>E: ...unless, of course, it was a particularly *stupid* donkey.<br> <br>G: You see? If only *I'd* thought of saying that...<br> <br>E: Well, it is so often the way, sir, too late one thinks of what<br>   one *should* have said. Sir Thomas More, for instance -- burned alive <br>   for refusing to recant his Catholicism -- must have been kicking him-<br>   self, as the flames licked higher, that it never occurred to him<br>   to say, "I recant my Catholicism."<br> <br>G: Well, yes, you see, only the other day, Prime Minister Pitt called<br>   me an "idle scrounger," and it wasn't until ages later that I thought<br>   how clever it would've been to have said, "Oh, bugger off, you old fart!"<br>   I need to improve my mind, Blackadder. I want people to say, "That George,<br>   why, he's as clever as a stick in a bucket of pig swill."<br> <br>E: And how do you suggest this miracle is to be achieved, Your Highness?<br>  <br>G: Easy: I shall become best friends with the cleverest man in England.<br>   That renowned brainbox, Dr. Samuel Johnson, has asked me to be patron<br>   of his new book, and I intend to accept.<br> <br>E: Would this be the long-awaited Dictionary, sir?<br> <br>G: Oh, who cares about the title as long as there's plenty of juicy murders<br>   in it. I hear it's a masterpiece.<br> <br>E: No, sir, it is not. It's the most pointless book since "How To Learn<br>   French" was translated into French.  (moves into living area)<br> <br>G: (follows) You haven't got anything personal against Johnson, have you<br>   Blackadder?<br> <br>E: Good Lord, sir, not at all. In fact, I had never heard of him until <br>   you mentioned him just now.<br> <br>G: But you do think he's a genius...?<br> <br>E: No, sir, I do not. Unless, of course, the definition of `genius' in his<br>   ridiculous Dictionary is "a fat dullard or wobblebottom; a pompous ass with<br>   sweatly dewflaps." (presumably a mispronunciation of `dewlaps')<br> <br>G: Oh, close shave there, then. Lucky you warned me. I was about to embrace<br>   this unholy arse to the royal bosom.<br> <br>E: I'm delighted to have been instrumental of keeping your bosom free of<br>   arses, sir.<br> <br>G: Bravo -- don't want to waste my valuable time with wobblebottoms.<br>   Er, fetch some tea, will you, Blackadder?<br> <br>E: Certainly, sir.<br> <br>G: Oh, and make it two cups, will you? That splendid brainbox, Dr. Johnson, is<br>   coming round.<br> <br> <br>In Baldrick/Blackadder's Quarters<br> <br>E: (makes noise of disgust)<br> <br>B: Something wrong, Mr. B?<br> <br>E: Oh, something's always wrong, Balders. (dumps all bottles and glasses<br>   from the drinks tray he is carrying into a barrel, where they all break)<br>   The fact that I'm not a millionaire aristocrat with the sexual capacity<br>   of a rutting rhino is a constant niggle. But, today, something's even<br>   wronger. That globulous fraud, Dr. Johnson, is coming to tea.<br> <br>B: I thought he was the cleverest man in England.<br> <br>E: Baldrick, I'd bump into cleverer people at a lodge meeting of the Guild of<br>   Village Idiots.<br> <br>B: That's not what you said when you sent him your navel.<br> <br>E: *Novel*, Baldrick -- not navel. I sent him my novel.<br> <br>B: Well, novel or navel, it sounds a bit like a bag of grapefruits to me.<br> <br>E: The phrase, Baldrick, is "a case of sour grapes," and yes it bloody well<br>   is. I mean, he might at least have written back, but no, nothing, not even<br>   a "Dear Gertrude Perkins: Thank you for your book. Get stuffed.<br>   --Samuel Johnson."<br> <br>B: Gertrude Perkins?<br> <br>E: Yes, I gave myself a female pseudonym. Everybody's doing it these days:<br>   Mrs. Ratcliffe, Jane Austen--<br> <br>B: What, Jane Austen's a man?<br> <br>E: Of course -- a huge Yorkshireman with a beard like a rhododendron bush.<br> <br>B: Oh, quite a small one, then?<br> <br>E: Well, compared to Dorothy Wordsworth's, certainly. James Boswell is the<br>   only real woman writing at the moment, and that's just because she <br>   wants to get inside Johnson's britches.<br> <br>B: Perhaps your book really isn't any good.<br> <br>E: Oh, codswallop! It's taken me seven years, and it's perfect. "Edmund:<br>   A Butler's Tale" -- a giant rollercoaster of a novel in four hundred<br>   sizzling chapters. A searing indictment of domestic servitude in the<br>   eighteenth century, with some hot gypsies thrown in. My magnum opus,<br>   Baldrick. Everybody has one novel in them, and this is mine.<br> <br>B: And this is mine (takes a small piece of paper from the front of his<br>   trousers). My magnificent octopus.<br> <br>E: (takes it) This is your novel, Baldrick? (unfolds it)<br> <br>B: Yeah -- I can't stand long books.<br> <br>E: (reads) "Once upon a time, there was a lovely little sausage<br>   called `Baldrick', and it lived happily ever after."<br> <br>B: It's semi-autobiographical.<br> <br>E: And it's completely utterly awful. Dr. Johnson will probably love it.<br> <br>(a bell rings)<br> <br>E: Oh, speak of the devil. Well, I'd better go and make the great Doctor<br>   comfortable. Let's just see how damned smart Dr. Fatty-Know-It-All<br>   really is. (goes up stairway) Oh, and prepare a fire for the Prince,<br>   will you, Baldrick?<br> <br>B: What shall I use?<br> <br>E: Oh, any old rubbish will do. Paper's quite good. Here, (crumples up<br>   Baldrick's `novel') try this for starters (throws paper at Baldrick).<br> <br> <br>In Prince's House<br> <br>(knock at door)<br> <br>G: Enter!<br> <br>E: Dr. Johnson, Your Highness.<br> <br>G: Ah, Dr. Johnson! Damn cold day!<br> <br>J: Indeed it is, sir -- but a very fine one, for I celebrated last night the<br>   encyclopaedic implementation of my pre-meditated orchestration of demotic<br>   Anglo-Saxon.<br> <br>G: (nods, grinning, then speaks) Nope -- didn't catch any of that.<br> <br>J:  Well, I simply observed, sir, that I'm felicitous, since, during the<br>    course of the penultimate solar sojourn, I terminated my uninterrupted<br>    categorisation of the vocabulary of our post-Norman tongue.<br> <br>G: Well, I don't know what you're talking about, but it sounds damn saucy,<br>   you lucky thing! I know some fairly liberal-minded girls, but I've<br>   never penultimated any of them in a solar sojourn, or, for that matter,<br>   been given any Norman tongue!<br> <br>E: I believe, sir, that the Doctor is trying to tell you that he is happy<br>   because he has finished his book. It has, apparently, taken him ten years.<br> <br>G: Yes, well, I'm a slow reader myself...<br> <br>J: (places two manuscripts on the table, but picks up the top one)<br>   Here it is, sir: the very cornerstone of English scholarship. This book,<br>   sir, contains every word in our beloved language.<br> <br>G: Hmm.<br> <br>E: Every single one, sir?<br> <br>J: (confidently) Every single word, sir!<br> <br>E: (to Prince) Oh, well, in that case, sir, I hope you will not object if<br>   I also offer the Doctor my most enthusiastic contrafribblarities.<br> <br>J: What?<br> <br>E: `Contrafribblarites', sir? It is a common word down our way.<br> <br>J: Damn! (writes in the book)<br> <br>E: Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I'm anus-peptic, phrasmotic, even compunctious to have<br>   caused you such pericombobulation.<br> <br>J: What? What? WHAT?<br> <br>G: What are you on about, Blackadder? This is all beginning to sound a bit<br>   like dago talk to me.<br> <br>E: I'm sorry, sir. I merely wished to congratulate the Doctor on not having<br>   left out a single word. (J sneers) Shall I fetch the tea, Your Highness?<br> <br>G: Yes, yes -- and get that damned fire up here, will you?<br> <br>E: Certainly, sir. I shall return interphrastically. (exits) (J writes some<br>   more)<br> <br>G: So, Dr. Johnson. Sit ye down. Now, this book of yours...tell me, what's<br>   it all about?<br> <br>J: It is a book about the English language, sir.<br> <br>G: I see! And the hero's name is what?<br> <br>J: There is no hero, sir.<br> <br>G: No hero? Well, lucky I reminded you. Better put one in pronto! Ermm...<br>   call him `George'. `George' is a good name for a hero. Er, now; what about<br>   heroines?<br> <br>J: There is no heroine, sir...unless it is our Mother Tongue.<br> <br>G: Ah, the *mother's* the heroine. Nice twist. How far have we got, then? Old<br>   Mother Tongue is in love with George the Hero. Now what about murders?<br>   Mother Tongue doesn't get murdered, does she?<br> <br>J: No she doesn't. No-one gets murdered, or married, or in a tricky situation<br>   over a pound note!<br> <br>G: Well, now, look, Dr. Johnson, I may be as thick as a whale omelette, but<br>   even I know a book's got to have a plot.<br> <br>J: Not this one, sir. It is a book that tells you what English words mean.<br> <br>G: I *know* what English words mean; I *speak* English! You must be a bit<br>   of a thicko.<br> <br>J: (stand) Perhaps you would rather not be patron of my book if you can see<br>   no value in it whatsoever, sir!<br> <br>G: (stands) Well, perhaps so, sir! As it sounds to me as if my being patron<br>   of this complete cowpat of a book would set the seal once and for all on<br>   my reputation as an utter turnip-head!<br> <br>J: Well! It is a reputation well deserved, sir! (sarcastically) Farewell!<br>   (opens door to find Edmund with tea tray)<br> <br>E: Leaving already, Doctor? Not staying for your pendigestatery<br>   interludicule?<br> <br>J: No, sir! Show me out!<br> <br>E: Certainly, sir -- anything I can do to facilitate your velocitous<br>   extramuralisation.<br> <br>J: (to Prince) You will regret this doubly, sir. Not only have you<br>   impecuniated (turns to Edmund and makes a boasting noise, then continues)<br>   my Dictionary, but you've also lost the chance to act as patron to the only<br>   book in the world that is even better.<br> <br>E: Oh, and what is that, sir? "Dictionary II: The Return of the Killer<br>   Dictionary"?<br> <br>J: No, sir! It is "Edmund: A Butler's Tale" (Edmund knocks over some of the<br>   teacups) by Gertrude Perkins -- a huge rollercoaster of a novel crammed<br>   with sizzling gypsies. (to Prince) Had you supported it, sir, it would<br>   have made you and me and Gertrude millionaires.<br> <br>E: (shocked) Millionaires!! (clears his throat as J and P look at him oddly)<br> <br>J: But it was not to be, sir. I fare you well; I shall not return.<br> <br>E: (to Prince) Excuse me, sir. (follows Johnson out) Er, Dr. Johnson...<br>   A word, I beg you.<br> <br>J: A word with you, sir, can mean seven million syllables. You might start<br>   now and not be finished by bedtime! (pauses, realised he's forgotten<br>   something) Oh, blast my eyes! In my fury, I have left my Dictionary<br>   with your foolish master! Go fetch it, will you?<br> <br>E: Sir, the Prince is young and foolish, and has a peanut for a brain. Give <br>   me just a few minutes and I will deliver both the book and his patronage.<br> <br>J: Oh, will you, sir... I very much doubt it. A servant who is an influence<br>   for the good is like a dog who speaks: very rare. <br> <br>E: I think I can change his mind.<br> <br>J: Hmpf! Well, I doubt it, sir. A man who can change a prince's mind is<br>   like a dog who speaks *Norwegian*: even rarer! I shall be at Mrs. Miggins'<br>   Literary Salon in twenty minutes. Bring the book there. (exits)<br> <br> <br>Back in the Prince's House (a fire is blazing in the fireplace)<br> <br>E: Your Highness, may I offer my congratulations?<br> <br>G: Well, thanks, Blackadder. That pompous babboon won't be back in a hurry.<br> <br>E: Oh, on the contrary, sir. Dr. Johnson left in the highest of spirits.<br> <br>G: What?<br> <br>E: He is utterly thrilled at your promise to patronise his Dictionary.<br> <br>G: I told him to sod off, didn't I?<br> <br>E: Yes, sir, but that was a joke...surely.<br> <br>G: Was it?<br> <br>E: Certainly! and a brilliant one once more.<br> <br>G: (happy at the idea he managed to pull off a joke, pretends that it was<br>   his intention all along) Yes, yes! I...er...suppose it was, rather,<br>   wasn't it...<br> <br>E: So may I deliver your note of patronage to Dr. Johnson as promised?<br> <br>G: Well, of course. If that's what I promised, then that's what I must do.<br>   ...and I remember promising it distinctly.<br> <br>E: Excellent. (to Baldrick) Nice fire, Baldrick.<br> <br>B: Thank you, Mr. B.<br> <br>E: Right, let's get the book. Now; Baldrick, where's the manuscript?<br> <br>B: You mean the big papery thing tied up with string?<br> <br>E: Yes, Baldrick -- the manuscript belonging to Dr. Johnson.<br> <br>B: You mean the baity fellow in the black coat who just left?<br> <br>E: Yes, Baldrick -- Dr. Johnson.<br> <br>B: So you're asking where the big papery thing tied up with string belonging<br>   to the baity fellow in the black coat who just left is.<br> <br>E: Yes, Baldrick, I am, and if you don't answer, then the booted bony thing<br>   with five toes at the end of my leg will soon connect sharply with the<br>   soft dangly collection of objects in your trousers. For the last time,<br>   Baldrick: Where is Dr. Johnson's manuscript?<br> <br>B: On the fire.<br> <br>E: (shocked) On the *what*?<br> <br>B: The hot orangy thing under the stony mantlepiece.<br> <br>E: You *burned* the Dictionary?<br> <br>B: Yup.<br> <br>E: You burned the life's work of England's foremost man of letters?<br> <br>B: Well, you did say "burn any old rubbish."<br> <br>E: Yes, fine.<br> <br>G: Isn't it, er...Isn't it going to be a bit difficult for me to patronise<br>   this book if we've burnt it?<br> <br>E: Yes, it is, sir. If you would excuse me a moment...<br> <br>G: Oh, of course, of course. Now that I've got my lovely fire, I'm as happy<br>   as a Frenchman who's invented a pair of self-removing trousers.<br> <br>E: Baldrick, will you join me in the vestibule?<br> <br> <br>In the Vestibule<br> <br>E: (grabs Baldrick by the lapels) *We* are going to go to Mrs. Miggins',<br>   we're going to find out where Dr. Johnson keeps a copy of that<br>   Dictionary, and then *you* are going to steal it.<br> <br>B: Me?<br> <br>E: Yes, you!<br> <br>B: Why me?<br> <br>E: Because you burnt it, Baldrick.<br> <br>B: But then I'll go to Hell forever for stealing.<br> <br>E: Baldrick, believe me: eternity in the company of Beezlebub and all his<br>   hellish instruments of death will be a picnic compared to five minutes<br>   with me -- and this pencil -- if we can't replace this Dictionary.<br> <br> <br>In Mrs. Miggins' coffee shoppe (`Literary Salon')<br> <br>(Shelley, Coleridge, and Byron are at a table. Shelley sits up holding a<br> handkerchief; Byron stands very erect, staring straight ahead at nothing;<br> Coleridge appears dead. As Shelley begins to speak, the person at the next<br> table stands and moves to a table as far away as possible.)<br> <br>S: O, Love-bourne ecstasy that is Mrs. Miggins, wilt thou bring me but one<br>   cup of the browned juicings of that naughty bean we call `coffee', ere I<br>   die...<br> <br>M: (swoons) Ooohhhh, you do have a way of words with you, Mr. Shelley!<br> <br>By: To Hell with this fine talking. Coffee, woman! My consumption grows <br>    evermore acute, and Coleridge's drugs are wearing off.<br> <br>M: Ohh, Mr. Byron, don't be such a big girl's blouse!<br> <br>(cut to outside of shoppe...dogs bark)<br> <br>E: Don't forget the pencil, Baldrick.<br> <br>B: Oh, I certainly won't, sir.<br> <br>(Edmund and Baldrick enter)<br> <br>E: Ah, good day to you, Mrs. Miggins.<br> <br>M: (swoons and giggles)<br> <br>E: A cup of your best hot water with brown grit in it -- unless, of course,<br>   by some miracle, your coffee shop has started selling coffee.<br> <br>By: Be quiet, sir. Can't you see we're dying?<br> <br>M: Don't you worry about my poets, Mr. Blackadder. They're not dead;<br>   they're just being intellectual.<br> <br>E: Mrs. Miggins, there's nothing intellectual about wandering around Italy<br>   in a big shirt, trying to get laid. Why are they *here* of all places?<br> <br>By: We are here, sir, to pay homage to the great Dr. Johnson, as, sir,<br>    should you!<br> <br>E: Oh, well, absolutely! Erm...I intend to. Er, you wouldn't happen to have a <br>   copy of his Dictionary on you, would you, so I can do some revising before<br>   he gets here?<br> <br>(Johnson enters)<br> <br>J: Friends, I have returned.<br> <br>(poets welcome him; Edmund says `Hurray')<br> <br>By: So, sir, how was the Prince?<br> <br>J: (adjusting his powdered wig) The Prince was and is an utter fool, and his<br>   household filled with cretinous servants. (his gaze then falls upon Edmund,<br>   and he does a double-take while the poets laugh)<br> <br>E: Good afternoon, sir.<br> <br>J: And you are the worst of them, sir. After all your boasting, have you <br>   my Dictionary and my patronage?<br> <br>E: Not quite. The Prince begs just a few more hours to really get to<br>   grips with it.<br> <br>J: Bah!!<br> <br>Poets: Bah!!<br> <br>E: However, I was wondering if a lowly servant such as I might be permitted<br>   to glance at a copy.<br> <br>J: COPY?!<br> <br>Poets and Johnson: COPY?! <br> <br>J: There is no copy, sir.<br> <br>E: No copy?<br> <br>J: No, sir. Making a copy is like fitting wheels to a tomato, time consuming<br>   and completely unnecessary.<br> <br>(poets laugh)<br> <br>E: But what if the book got lost?<br> <br>J: I should not lose the book, sir, (stands, coffee cup in hand, approaching<br>   Edmund menacingly) and if any other man should, I would tear off<br>   his head with my bare hands and feed it to the cat! (breaks coffee cup<br>   by squeezing)<br> <br>E: Well, that's nice and clear.<br> <br>By: And I, Lord Byron, (unsheathing a sword) would summon up fifty of my men,<br>    lay siege to the fellow's house and do bloody murder on him. (rests<br>    sword on Baldrick's shoulder)<br>     <br>C: (pointing a blade at Edmund) And I would not rest until the criminal was<br>   hanging by his hair, with an Oriental disembowelling cutlass thrust up his<br>   ignoble behind.<br> <br>E: I hope you're listening to all this, Baldrick.<br> <br> <br>In Prince's House (Prince is peeling an apple)<br> <br>E: Sir, I have been unable to replace the Dictionary. I am therefore leaving<br>   immediately for Nepal, where I intend to live as a goat.<br> <br>G: Why?<br> <br>E: Because if I stay here, Dr. Johnson's companions will have me brutally<br>   murdered, sir.<br> <br>G: Good God, Blackadder, that's terrible! (aside) Do you know any other <br>   butlers?<br> <br>E: And, of course, when the people discover you have burnt Dr. Johnson's<br>   Dictionary, they may go round saying, "Look! There's thick George. He's<br>   got a brain the size of a weasel's wedding tackle."<br> <br>G: In that case, something must be done!<br> <br>B: I have a cunning plan, sir.<br> <br>G: Hurrah! Well, that's that, then.<br> <br>E: I wouldn't get overexcited, sir. I have a horrid suspicion that Baldrick's<br>   plan will be the stupidest thing we've heard since Lord Nelson's famous<br>   signal at the Battle of the Nile: "England knows Lady Hamilton's a virgin.<br>   Poke my eye out and cut off my arm if I'm wrong."<br> <br>G: Great! Let's hear it, then.<br> <br>B: It's brilliant. You take the string -- that's still not completely<br>   burnt -- you scrape off the soot, and you shove the pages in again.<br> <br>E: Which pages?<br> <br>B: Well, not the same ones, of course.<br> <br>E: Yes, I think I'm on the point of spotting the flaw in this plan, but do<br>   go on. Which pages are they?<br> <br>B: Well, this is the brilliant bit: You write some new ones.<br> <br>E: ...some new ones. You mean rewrite the Dictionary. I sit down tonight and<br>   rewrite the Dictionary that took Dr. Johnson ten years.<br> <br>B: Yup.<br> <br>E: Baldrick, that is by far and away, and without a shadow of doubt, the<br>   worst and most comtemptible plan in the history of the universe. On the<br>   other hand, I hear the sound of disembowelling cutlasses being sharpened,<br>   and it's the only plan we've got, so if you will excuse me, gentlemen...<br> <br>G: Perhaps you'd like me to lend a hand, Blackadder. I'm not as stupid as I<br>   look.<br> <br>B: I *am* as stupid as I look, sir, but if I can help, I will.<br> <br>E: Well, it's very kind of you both, but I fear your services might be as<br>   useful as a barber shop on the steps of the guillotine.<br> <br>G: Oh, come on, Blackadder, give us a try!<br> <br>E: Very well, sir, as you wish. Let's start at the beginning, shall we?<br>   First: `A'. How would you define `a'?<br> <br>B: Ohh...`a' (continues this in background)<br> <br>G: Oh, I love this! I love this: quizzies...Errmmm, hang on, it's coming...<br>   ooohh, crikey, errmm, oh yes, I've got it!<br> <br>E: What?<br> <br>G: Well, it doesn't really mean anything, does it?<br> <br>E: Good. So we're well on the way, then. " `a'; impersonal pronoun;<br>   doesn't really mean anything." Right! Next: `A'... `A-B'.<br> <br>(Baldrick and Prince ponder over this)<br> <br>B: Well, it's a buzzing thing, isn't it. "A buzzing thing."<br> <br>E: Baldrick, I mean something that starts with `A-B'.<br> <br>B: Honey? Honey starts with a bee.<br> <br>G: He's right, you know, Blackadder. Honey does start a bee...and a flower,<br>   too.<br> <br>E: Yes, look, this really isn't getting anywhere. And besides, I've left out<br>   `aardvark'.<br> <br>G: Oh well, don't say we didn't give it a try.<br> <br>E: No, Your Highness, it was a brave start, but I fear I must proceed on my <br>   own. Now; Baldrick, go to the kitchen and make me something quick and sim-<br>   ple to eat, would you? Two slices of bread with something in between.<br> <br>B: What, like Gerald, Lord Sandwich, had the other day?<br> <br>E: Yes -- a few rounds of Geralders.<br> <br> <br>(Sometime later, it is nighttime. Edmund is sitting at desk writing the <br>dictionary. Candles flicker. Prince George and Baldrick come in)<br> <br>G: How goes it, Blackadder?<br> <br>E: Not all that well, sir.<br> <br>G: Well, let's have a look...(reads) "Medium-sized insectivore with<br>   protruding nasal implement." (pauses) Doesn't sound much like a bee to me.<br> <br>E: (shouts) It's an aardvark! Can't you see that, Your Highness? It's a <br>   bloody aardvark!!<br> <br>G: Oh dear -- still on `aardvark', are we?<br> <br>E: Yes, I'm afraid we are. And if I ever meet an aardvark, I'm going to <br>   step on its damn protruding nasal implement until it couldn't suck <br>   up an insect if its life depended on it.<br> <br>G: Got a bit stuck, have you?<br> <br>E: I'm sorry, sir. It's five hours later, and I've got every word in the<br>   English language except `a' and `aardvark' still to do. And I'm not  <br>   very happy with my definition of either of them.<br> <br>G: Well, don't panic, Blackadder, because I have some rather good news.<br> <br>E: Oh? What?<br> <br>G: Well, we didn't take `no' for an answer, and have, in fact, been working<br>   all night. I've done `B'.<br> <br>E: Really? And how have you got on?<br> <br>G: Well, I had a bit of trouble with `belching', but I think I got it<br>   sorted out in the end. (burps) Oh no, there I go again! (laughs)<br> <br>E: You've been working on that joke for some time, haven't you, sir?<br> <br>G: Well, yes, I have, as a matter of fact, yes.<br> <br>E: Since you started...<br> <br>G: Basically.<br> <br>E: So, in fact, you haven't done any work at all.<br> <br>G: Not as such, no.<br> <br>E: Great. Baldrick, what have you done?<br> <br>B: I've done `C' and `D'.<br> <br>E: Right, let's have it, then.<br> <br>B: Right. "Big blue wobbly thing that mermaids live in."<br> <br>E: What's that?<br> <br>B: `Sea'.<br> <br>E: Yes -- tiny misunderstanding. Still, my hopes weren't high. Now;<br>   what about `D'?<br> <br>B: I'm quite pleased with `dog'.<br> <br>E: Yes, and your definition of `dog' is...?<br> <br>B: "Not a cat."<br> <br>E: Excellent. Excellent! Your Highness, may I have a word?<br> <br>G: Certainly.<br> <br>E: As you know, sir, it has always been my intention to stay with you until<br>   you had a strapping son and I one likewise to take over the burdens<br>   of my duties.<br> <br>G: That's right, Blackadder, and I thank you for it.<br> <br>E: But I'm afraid, sir, that there has been a change of plan. I am off to <br>   the kitchen to hack my head off with a big knife.<br> <br>G: Oh, come on, Blackadder, it's only a book. Let's just damn the fellow's<br>   eyes, strip the britches from his backside and warm his heels to Putney<br>   Bridge! HURRAH!<br> <br>E: Sir, these are not the days of Alfred the Great. You can't just lop<br>   someone's head off and blame it on the Vikings.<br> <br>G: Can't I, by God!<br> <br>E: No.<br> <br>G: Oh, well, all right, then let's just get on with it! I mean, boil my<br>   brains, it's only a dictionary. No-one's asked us to eat ten raw pigs<br>   for breakfast. Good Lord, I mean, we're *British*, aren't we? (exits)<br> <br>E: (mutters) You're not; you're German. (to Baldrick) Get me some coffee,<br>   Baldrick. If I fall asleep before Monday, we're doomed!<br> <br> <br>(Monday morning)<br> <br>B: Mr. Blackadder, time to wake up...<br> <br>E: What time is it?<br> <br>B: Monday morning.<br> <br>E: (panics) Monday morning?! Oh my God! I've overslept! Where's the quill?<br>   Where's the parchment?<br> <br>B: I don't know. Maybe Dr. Johnson's got some with him.<br> <br>E: WHAT??!<br> <br>B: He's outside.<br> <br>E: (screams) AAAOOOOHHHH!<br> <br>(Johnson enters)<br> <br>J: Are you ill, sir?<br> <br>E: No, you can't have it. I know I said Monday, but I want Baldrick to read<br>   it, which, unfortunately will mean teaching him to read, which will take<br>   about ten years -- but time well spent, I think, because it's such a very<br>   good dictionary.<br> <br>J: I don't think so.<br> <br>E: (exclaims) Oh God! We've been burgled!! (pauses) What?<br> <br>J: I think it's an awful dicitonary, full of feeble definitions and ridiculous<br>   verbiage. I've come to ask you to chuck the damn thing in the fire.<br> <br>E: Are you sure?<br> <br>J: I've never been so sure of anything in my life, sir.<br> <br>E: I love you, Dr. Johnson, and I want to have your babies. (they embrace;<br>   Edmund notices a woman standing behind Johnson) Oh, sorry, excuse me, Dr.<br>   Johnson, but my Auntie Marjorie has just arrived. (looks at Baldrick, who<br>   has an dog's head) Baldrick, who gave you permission to turn into an<br>   Alsatian? (Baldrick waves; Edmund realises the absurdity of the scene)<br>   Oh God, it's a dream, isn't it? (Johnson, Baldrick and Auntie twirl out<br>   the door) It's a bloody dream! (sound of harps is heard) Dr. Johnson<br>   doesn't want us to burn his Dictionary at all.<br> <br> <br>(Monday morning - Take Two)<br> <br>B: Mr. Blackadder, time to wake up...<br> <br>E: What time is it?<br> <br>B: Monday morning.<br> <br>E: (panics) Monday morning?! Oh my God! I've overslept! Where's the quill?<br>   Where's the parchment?<br> <br>B: I don't know. Maybe Dr. Johnson's got some with him.<br> <br>E: WHAT??!<br> <br>B: He's outside.<br> <br>E: AA-- Now, hang on. Hang on. If we go on like this, you're going to turn<br>   into an Alsatian again.<br> <br>(Johnson and other poets bang noisily at the door)<br> <br>E: Oh my God! Quick, Baldrick, we've got to escape.<br> <br>S: (?), sir! Bring out the Dictionary at once.<br> <br>By: Bring it out, sir, or, in my passion, I shall kill everyone by giving<br>    them syphilis!<br> <br>C: Bring it out, sir, and also any opium plants you may have around there.<br> <br>J: Bring it out, sir, or we shall break down the door!<br> <br>E: (opens the door) Ah, good morning. Dr. Johnson, Lord Byron--<br> <br>J: Where is my Dictionary?<br> <br>E: And what dictionary would this be?<br> <br>J: The one that has taken eighteen hours of every day for the last ten years.<br>   My mother died; I hardly noticed. My father cut off his head and fried it<br>   in garlic in the hope of attracting my attention; I scarcely looked up from <br>   my work. My wife brought armies of lovers to the house, who worked in <br>   droves so that she might bring up a huge family of bastards. I cannot--<br> <br>E: Am I to presume that my elaborate bluff has not worked?<br> <br>J: Dictionary!<br> <br>E: Right, well, the truth is, Doctor -- now, don't get cross, don't over-<br>   react -- the truth is: we burnt it.<br> <br>J: Then you die! <br> <br>(Poets all raise their swords to Edmund; Prince George enters from his<br> sleeping quarters, carrying the dictionary)<br> <br>G: 'morning, everyone. You know, this Dictionary really is a cracking good <br>   read. It's an absolutely splendid job!<br> <br>J: My Dictionary! (to Edmund) But you said you burned it!<br> <br>E: Erm...<br> <br>G: I think it's a splendid book, and I look forward to patronising it <br>   enormously!<br> <br>J: Oh, well, thank you, sir. Well, I think I'm man enough to sacrifice the<br>   pleasure of killing to maintain the general good humour. (to poets) <br>   There's to be no murder today, gentlemen. (poets complain) But prepare<br>   to Mrs. Miggins' -- I shall join you there later for a roister you will<br>   never forget!<br> <br>(poets cheer and exit)<br> <br>J: (to George) So, ahem, tell me, sir, what words particularly interested<br>   you?<br> <br>G: Oh, er, nothing... Anything, really, you know...<br> <br>J: Ah, I see you've udnerlined a few (takes dictionary, reads): `bloomers';<br>   `bottom'; `burp'; (turns a page) `fart'; `fiddle'; `fornicate'?<br> <br>G: Well...<br> <br>J: Sir! I hope you're not using the first English dictionary to look up<br>   rude words!<br> <br>E: I wouldn't be too hopeful; that's what all the other ones will be<br>   used for.<br> <br>B: (to Edmund) Sir, can I look up `turnip'?<br> <br>E: `Turnip' isn't a rude word, Baldrick.<br> <br>B: It is if you sit on one.<br> <br>J: Really, sir, we have more important business in hand. I refer, of course,<br>   to the works of the mysterious Gertrude Perkins.<br> <br>E: Mysterious no more, sir. It is time for the truth. I can, at last, reveal<br>   the identity of the great Gertrude Perkins.<br> <br>J: Sir, who is she?<br> <br>E: She, sir, is me, sir. I am Gertrude Perkins.<br> <br>G: Good Lord!!<br> <br>E: And what's more: I can prove it. Bring out the manuscript, and I will show<br>   you that my signature corresponds exactly with that on the front.<br> <br>J: Why, I must have left it here when I left the Dictionary.<br> <br>G: This is terribly exciting!!!<br> <br>E: Baldrick, fetch my novel.<br> <br>B: Novel?<br> <br>E: Yes -- the big papery thing tied up with string.<br> <br>B: What, like the thing we burnt?<br> <br>E: Exactly like the thing we burnt.<br> <br>B: So you're asking for the big papery thing tied up with string, exactly<br>   like the thing we burnt.<br> <br>E: Exactly.<br> <br>B: We burnt it.<br> <br>E: So we did. Thank you, Baldrick -- seven years of my life up in smoke.<br>   Your Highness, would you excuse me a moment?<br> <br>G: By all means.<br> <br>(Edmund exits)<br> <br>E: (from outside) OH GOD, NO!!!!!!!!!!!! (re-enters) Thank you, sir.<br> <br>J: Burned, you say? That's most inconvenient. A burned novel is like a <br>   burned dog: You--<br> <br>E: Oh shut up!<br> <br>B: (to Johnson) Sir, I have a novel. (gives Johnson the bit of paper seen<br>   earlier)<br> <br>J: (reads) "Once upon a time there was a lovely little sausage called `B--"<br>   `Sausage'?! `SAUSAGE'?!!!!! Oh, blast your eyes! (throws paper down and<br>   exits angrily)<br> <br>B: Oh, well, I didn't think it was that bad!<br> <br>E: (looking inside the Dictionary) I think you'll find he left `sausage'<br>   out of his Dictionary, Baldrick. (shuts the Dictionary, but notices<br>   something on the first page) Oh, and `aardvark'...<br> <br>G: Oh, come on, Blackadder; it's not all that bad -- nothing a nice roaring <br>   fire can't solve. Er, Baldrick, do the honours, will you?<br> <br>B: Certainly, Your Majesty.<br> <br>(Prince and Edmund exit. Baldrick picks up Edmund's crumpled papers from<br> trying to write the Dictionary, and the real Dictionary. He thumbs through<br> the Dictionary, then tosses it into the fire.)<br> <br>(End/Credits roll)<br> <br> <br>       				 For the<br>		        BENEFIT of SEVERAL VIEWERS<br>		         MR.
