<br>
<br>Corporal Punishment
<br>(in BA's quarters; Edmund is on the phone)
<br>
<br>Edmund: You'd like to book a table for three by the window for 9.30 PM,
<br>	not too near the band, in the name of Obel-ointment Fungentula.
<br>	Yes, yes, I think you might have the wrong number. Alright.
<br>	(hangs up; enter George)
<br>
<br>George: Rather close line there, eh sir? That phone system is a shambles
<br>	no wonder we haven't had any orders!
<br>
<br>Edmund: Oh, on the contrary, George, we've had plenty of orders. We have
<br>	orders for six meters of Hungarian crushed velvet curtain material,
<br>	four rock salmon and a ha'pence of chips and a cab for a Mr. Redgrave
<br>	picking up from 14 Arnost Grove Raintop Bell.
<br>
<br>George: Rather we don't want those sort of orders, we want orders to Deck Old
<br>	Glory. When are we going to give Fritz a taste of our British spunk?
<br>
<br>Edmund: George, please. No one is more anxious to advance than I am, but until
<br>	I get these communication problems sorted out, I'm afraid we're stuck.
<br>	(phone rings) Captain Blackadder speaking.....no, I'm afraid the line's
<br>	very cclllffffhhtttt!
<br>
<br>Darling: Hello? Hello, Captain Blackadder, hello?
<br>
<br>(a German accent pops up; really Edmund. He rustles paper, pretending the re-
<br> ception's lousy.)
<br>
<br>Edmund: Schenll, schenll, Die Koppeltop, I said, there's a terrible line at my
<br>	end. You are to advance on the enemy at once. (puts on a record)
<br>	"A wandering minstral eye in the...(record goes off, Edmund speaks)
<br>	..on Gail Force Eight.
<br>
<br>George: I say, come on, sir, what's the message? I'm on tenderhooks, do tell!
<br>
<br>Edmund: Well, as far as I can tell, the message was, "he's got a terrible lion
<br>	up his end, so there's an advantage to an enema at once."
<br>
<br>George: Damn!
<br>
<br>(enter Baldrick)
<br>
<br>Baldrick: Message from HQ, sir.
<br>
<br>George: Ah, now, this should be it. A telegram ordering an advance!
<br>
<br>Edmund: Ummm yes, I'm afraid not, George, it is a telegram, it is ordering
<br>	an advance, but it seems to be addressed to 'Catpain Blackudder'. Do
<br>	you know a 'Catpain Blackudder', George?
<br>
<br>George: Well, it rings a bell, but I..
<br>
<br>Edmund: Ouhh.....nope, me neither. (throws message away)
<br>
<br>George: Oh well.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Go away George, I'm sure if they want to contact us, they'll find a
<br>	way.
<br>
<br>Baldrick: Speaking, sir, speaking, there's a pigeon in our trench!
<br>
<br>George: Ah, now, this'll be it! (goes outside) Yes, it's one of the King's
<br>	carrier pigeons.
<br>
<br>(all go outside)
<br>
<br>Baldrick: No, it isn't, that pigeon couldn't carry the King! Hasn't got a
<br>	  tray or anything.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Hands, revolver please.
<br>
<br>George: Oh now, sir, you really shouldn't do this you know!
<br>
<br>Edmund: Come on George, with 50,000 men getting killed a week who's going to
<br>	miss a pigeon?  (shoots the pigeon dead)
<br>
<br>George: Well, not you, obviously, sir.
<br>
<br>Edmund: In any case, its's scarcely a court martial offence. Get plucking,
<br>	Baldrick.
<br>
<br>Baldrick: Alright, sir. Look, it's got a little ring 'round it's leg, there's
<br>	  a novelity!
<br>
<br>George: Oh really, is there a paper hat as well?
<br>
<br>Baldrick: No, but there's a joke. Read it out, sir.
<br>
<br>George: It's a bit charred. Something something at once..PS, due to communi-
<br>	cation crisis, the shooting of carrier pigeons is now a court-martial
<br>	offence. I don't see what's so funny about that, sir.
<br>
<br>Edmund: That's not funny, it's deadly serious, we're in trouble. So, I shall
<br>	eat the evidence for lunch and if anyone asks you any questions at all,
<br>	we didn't receive any messages and we definitely did not shoot this
<br>	plump breasted pigeon.
<br>
<br>(at BA's quarters...Edmund just had the pigeon for lunch.)
<br>
<br>Edmund: Umm..delicious.
<br>
<br>(enter Melchett and Darling)
<br>
<br>Melchett: Eahy, Blackadder!
<br>
<br>Darling: Attention!
<br>
<br>Melchett: And why, Captain, are you not advancing across No Man's Land?
<br>
<br>Edmund: Well, sir, call me a bluffo traditionalist, but I was always taught to
<br>	wait for the order to attack before attacking.
<br>
<br>Melchett: Are you trying to tell me you haven't received any orders? What the
<br>	  hell are you playing at, Darling?
<br>Darling: That's a flagrant lie, sir. I spoke to Blackadder less than an hour
<br>	 ago.
<br>	
<br>Edmund: Yes you did. To tell me some gobbledygook about having a lion up your
<br>	bottom.
<br>
<br>Melchett: Umm...I thought it's the old communications problem again. Stand easy.
<br>	  Action on this is imperative, take that down, Darling.
<br>
<br>Darling: Yes.
<br>	  use it more often in conversation.
<br>
<br>Darling: I must say sir, I find this all very unlikely. Not only did I tele-
<br>	 phone Blackadder, but as you'll recall, we sent him a telegram and
<br>	 a carrier pigeon.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Did you?
<br>
<br>Darling: Are you telling us you haven't had a pigeon, Blackadder?
<br>
<br>Edmund: Ohaaahhh!
<br>	  Jim", my only true love who's been with me since I was a nipper!
<br>	  And to business, I'm giving you your order to advance now. Syncronise
<br>	  watches gentlemen. Private, what is the time?
<br>
<br>Baldrick: We didn't receive any messages and Captain Blackadder definitely did
<br>	  not shoot the delicious plump breasted pigeon, sir.
<br>
<br>Melchett: WHAT???????
<br>
<br>Edmund: You want to be cremated, Baldrick or buried at sea?
<br>
<br>Baldrick: (thinking it over) Umm....
<br>
<br>Darling: Lieutenant?
<br>
<br>George: Sir.
<br>
<br>Darling: Do you mind answering a couple of questions?
<br>
<br>George: Not at all, sir. We didn't get any messages and Blackadder definitely
<br>	did not shoot this delicious plump breasted pigeon.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Good.
<br>
<br>Darling: And look sir, pigeon feathers. White feathers very apt, eh Blackadder?
<br>
<br>Melchett: White feathers?
<br>
<br>Baldrick: Oh no, sir, that's gobbleijuke! They're not white, they're sort of
<br>	  speckly!
<br>
<br>Melchett: (shocked) Speckly?! AAHHHHHHHH! YOU SHOT MY SPECKLED JIM???
<br>
<br>Darling: You're for it now, Blackadder. Quite frankly sir, I've suspected this
<br>	 for some time. Quite clearly, Captain Blackadder has been disobeying
<br>	 orders with a breathtaking impertinence.
<br>
<br>Melchett: I don't care if he's been watering the Duke of York with a prize-
<br>	  winning leak!  He shot my pigeon! (screams) AAAHH  AHHHH OOOHHHH!
<br>
<br>Darling: Take it easy. I think we should do this by the book, sir.
<br>
<br>Melchett: Yes, yes, you're right, of course. I'm sorry. Attention!
<br>
<br>Darling: (drums are heard in the background) Captain Blackadder, as of this
<br>	 moment you may consider yourself under arrest. You know what the
<br>	 penalty is for disobeying orders, Blackadder?
<br>
<br>Edmund: Umm..court-martial, followed by immediate cessation of chocolate
<br>	rations?
<br>
<br>Darling: No, court-martial followed by immediate death by firing squad.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Oh, so I got it half right.
<br>
<br>(at the cell)
<br>
<br>Perkins: (Edmund's guard) Sadder than a happy hour then, sir? Wave all our
<br>	 last goodbyes.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Oh, no need for that, Perkins, I'll just dash off a couple of notes,
<br>	one asking for a sponge bag, and the other sending for my lawyer.
<br>
<br>Perkins: Oh, your lawyer now, yes sir.  Don't you think that might be a bit
<br>	 of a waste of money, sir.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Not when he's the finest mind in English legal history.  Ever heard
<br>	of Bob Mattingburg?
<br>
<br>Perkins: Oh, yes indeed, sir!  A most gifted gentleman!
<br>
<br>Edmund: I remember Mattingburg's most famous case, the case of the bloody knife.
<br>	A man was found next to a murdured body, he had the knife in his hand,
<br>	thirteen witnesses that seen him stab the victim, when the police
<br>	arrived he said, "I'm glad I killed the bastard."  Mattingburg not
<br>	only got him off, but he got him knighted in the New Year's Honors
<br>	list, and the relatives of the victim had to pay to have the blood
<br>	washed out of his jacket.
<br>
<br>Perkins: There is a job under the prosecution involved, sir.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Yes, well, look at Oscar Wilde.
<br>
<br>Perkins: Oh, butch, Oscar.
<br>
<br>Edmund: A big, bearded, bonking, butch Oscar.  The terror of the ladies.  114
<br>	illegitamate children, world heavyweight boxing champion, and author
<br>	of the best-selling phamplet, "Why I Like To Do It With Girls".
<br>	Mattingburg had him sent down for being a whoopsie. (enter Baldrick)
<br>	Ah, Baldrick. Anything from Mattingburg yet?
<br>
<br>Baldrick: Yes, sir.  It just arrived, sir.
<br>
<br>Edmund: What is it?
<br>
<br>Baldrick: Sponge bag, sir.
<br>
<br>Edmund: A sponge bag.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Baldrick, I gave you two notes.  You sent the note asking for a sponge
<br>	bag to the finest mind in English legal history.
<br>
<br>Baldrick: Certianly did, sir!
<br>
<br>Edmund: And you sent the note requesting legal representation to...
<br>
<br>(enter George)
<br>
<br>George: Well, tally-ho, with a bing and a bong and a buzz-buzz-buzz! (THUMP!)
<br>
<br>Edmund: (digustingly, as we've all heard before) Oh God!
<br>
<br>George: I'll tell you, apart from all, sir, that I am deeply, deeply honored.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Baldrick, I'll deal you later.  Am I to understand that you are going to
<br>	represnt me at the court-martial?
<br>
<br>George: Absolutly, sir.  Well, it's a sort of family tradition, really.  My
<br>	uncle's a lawyer, you know.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Your uncle's a lawyer, but you're not.
<br>
<br>George: Oh, good lord, no.  I'm absolute duffer at this sort of thing.  In
<br>	school the basing society, I was voted the boy least likley to complete
<br>	a coherent...um...an oops...yes, anyway, my dear old friend, its an
<br>	honor to serve.
<br>	
<br>Edmund: George, I'm in trouble here. I need to construct thats as watertight
<br>	as a mermaid's brassiere.  I'm not sure your particular brand of
<br>	mindless optimism is going to contribute much to the proceedings.
<br>
<br>George: Well, that's a shame, sir, becarse I was planning on playing the
<br>	mindless optimisim card very strongly.
<br>
<br>Edmund: I beg your pardon?
<br>
<br>George: Yes, I've already planned my closing address based on that very thing.
<br>	Oh, go on, let him off, your honor, please!  It's a lovely day.  Pretty
<br>	clouds, trees, birds, etc.  I rest my case.
<br>
<br>Edmund: So, council, with that summing up in mind, what do you think my chances
<br>	are?
<br>
<br>George: Well, not all that good I'm afraid, as far as I can tell you're as
<br>	guilty as a puppy sitting next to a pile of poo.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Ah.
<br>
<br>(in the court room; Edmund's trial is taking place)
<br>
<br>George: (walking in) Crikey! So sorry I'm late, my luv.
<br>
<br>A voice: 'allo.
<br>
<br>George: But anyway, let me open up my defence straight away, by saying that
<br>	I've known this man for three years, he's an absolutely gawking chap.
<br>
<br>Edmund: George?
<br>
<br>George: Yes, sir?
<br>
<br>Edmund: That's the clerk of the court.
<br>
<br>George: Is it? Oh!
<br>
<br>Edmund: We haven't started yet.
<br>
<br>(enter Darling)
<br>
<br>Darling: Good luck, Blackadder.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Well, thank you,  Darling.  And what's your big job here today?
<br>	Straightening chairs?
<br>
<br>Darling: No, in fact I'm appearing for the prosecution.  I wouldn't raise your
<br>	 hopes too much, you're guilty as hell, you haven't got a chance.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Why thank you,  Darling.  And I hope your mother dies in a freak
<br>	yachting accident.
<br>
<br>Darling: Just doing my job, Blackadder.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Obeying orders, and of course, having enormous fun into the bargain.
<br>	I wouldn't be too confident if I were you, any reasonably impartial
<br>	judge is bound to let me off.
<br>
<br>Darling: Well, absolutely.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Who is the judge, by the way?
<br>
<br>Melchett: (boldly) Me!
<br>
<br>Edmund: I'm dead.
<br>
<br>Melchett: Well, come on, then.  Come on.  Get this over in five minutes, and
<br>	  then we can have a spot of lunch. (some noise from the others) The
<br>	  court is now in session, General Sir Anthony Cecil Hogmenay Melchett
<br>	  in the chair.  The case before us is that of the crown vs. Captain
<br>	  Edmund Blackadder, the flanderous pigeon murderer!  Oh, uh hand me
<br>	  the black cap, I'll be needing that.
<br>
<br>Edmund: I love a fair trial.
<br>
<br>Melchett: Anything to say before we kick off, Captain Darling?
<br>
<br>Darling: May it please the court, as this is clearly an open and shut case, I
<br>	 beg leave to bring a privete prosecution against the defence council
<br>	 for wasting the court's time.
<br>
<br>Melchett: Granted.  Council, he is fined fifty pounds for turning up.  This is
<br>	  fun!  This is just like a real court!  Alright!  Let the trial begin!
<br>	  The chagre before us is that the flanderous pigeon murderer did de-
<br>	  liberately, callously, and with beastliness of forethought murder a
<br>	  lovely, innocent pigeon.  And disobeyed some orders as well.
<br>	  Is this true?
<br>
<br>George: Perfectly true, sir. I was there.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Thanks George.
<br>
<br>George: Oh, dammit.
<br>
<br>Melchett: Right.  Council for the defence, get on with it.
<br>
<br>George: Oh, right, yes, right.  Um, yes.  I'd like to call my first witness
<br>	Captain Darling.
<br>
<br>Melchett: You wish to call the council for the prosecution as a defence
<br>	  witness?
<br>
<br>George: That's right. (aside) Don't worry, sir, I've got it all under control.
<br>	You are Captain Darling of the general staff?
<br>
<br>Darling: I am.
<br>
<br>George: Captain, leaving aside the incident in question, would you think of
<br>	Captain Blackadder as the sort of man that would usually ignore orders?
<br>
<br>Darling: Yes, I would.
<br>
<br>George:  Ah, um.  You sure?  I was rather banking on you saying no.
<br>
<br>Darling: I'm sure.  In fact, I have a list of other orders he's disobeyed,
<br>	 if it would be useful.  November 16th, 9:15am, 10:23am, 10:24am,
<br>	 11:17am...
<br>
<br>George: You missed one out, there.
<br>
<br>Darling: ...10:30am, 11:46am...
<br>
<br>Edmund: George!
<br>
<br>George: What?  Oh, oh ye-ye-right, yes.  Thank you, Captain.  No further
<br>	questions.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Well done, George.  You really had him on the ropes.
<br>
<br>George: Don't worry, old man.  I have a last and I think you'll find decisive
<br>	witness.  Call Private Baldrick.
<br>
<br>Edmund: (to Baldrick) Deny everything, Baldrick.
<br>
<br>George: Are you Private Baldrick?
<br>
<br>Baldrick: NO!
<br>
<br>George: Um, but you are Captain Balckadder's batman?
<br>
<br>Baldrick: NO!
<br>
<br>George: Come on, Baldrick.  Be a bit more helpful, it's me!
<br>
<br>Baldrick: No it isn't!
<br>
<br>Darling: Sir, I must protest!
<br>
<br>Melchett: Quite right!  We don't need your kind here, Private.  Get out.
<br>	  Sum up, please.
<br>
<br>George: Oh, right, yes, uhhhh, oh.....Uh, gentlemen, you have heard all the
<br>	evidence presented here today, but in the end it is up to the
<br>	conscience of your hearts to decide, and I firmly belive, that like
<br>	me, you will conclude that Captain Blackadder is in fact, totally
<br>	and utterly, GUILTY......of nothing more than trying to do his duty
<br>	under difficult circumstances.
<br>
<br>Melchett: Nonsence!  He's a hound and a rutter, and he's going to be shot!
<br>	  However, before we proceed to the formality of sentancing the
<br>	  deceased,  I mean the defendant, (laughs) I think we'd all rather
<br>	  enjoy the case of the prosecution.  Captain Darling, if you please.
<br>
<br>Darling: Sir, my case is very simple. I call my first witness, General Sir
<br>	 Anthony Cecil Hogmaney Melchett.
<br>
<br>Melchett: Ah..umm! (goes up to the stand)
<br>
<br>George: Clever, clever.
<br>
<br>Darling: General, did you own a lovely, plump, speckily pigeon called Speckled
<br>	 Jim, which you hand reared  from a chick and which was your only
<br>	 childhood friend?
<br>
<br>Melchett: (hysterical) Yes! (calmer) Yes, I did.
<br>
<br>Darling: And did Captain Blackadder shoot the aforementioned pigeon?
<br>
<br>Melchett: Yes, he did!
<br>
<br>Darling: (shouts) Can you see Captain Blackadder anywhere in this courtroom?
<br>
<br>Melchett: (overwrought, pointing his finger at Edmund) YES, THAT'S HIM!!!
<br>	  THAT'S THE MAN!!!!! AAHHHHH AAAAHHHHHH!!!!!
<br>
<br>Darling: No more questions, sir.
<br>
<br>Melchett: Very good, excellent, first class. Carry on. I therefore have ab-
<br>	  solutely no hesitation in announcing that the sentence of this
<br>	  court is: that you Captain Edmund Blackadder be taken from this
<br>	  place and shot to death by shooting tommorrow at dawn. (bangs
<br>	  gavel). Do you have anything to say?
<br>
<br>Edmund: Yes, can I have an alarm call, please?
<br>
<br>(at the cell)
<br>
<br>Perkins: Someone to see the Captain?
<br>
<br>Edmund: What does he look like?
<br>
<br>Perkins: Short, ugly...
<br>
<br>Edmund: Hello Baldrick.
<br>
<br>Baldrick: I brought you some food, sir, for your final breakfast tommorrow.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Ah, so you're not pinning much hope on a last minute reprieve then.
<br>
<br>Baldrick: No sir, you are as dead as some doo-doos.
<br>
<br>Edmund: The expression, Baldrick, is 'as a do-do'. 'Dead as a do-do'.
<br>
<br>Perkins: Well, I'll leave you to it then, shall I? (leaves)
<br>
<br>Baldrick: Do not despair, sir. All my talk of food was jsut a dead herring.
<br>	  In fact, I have a cunning plan. This is not food, but an escape
<br>	  kit.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Good Lord! A saw, a hammer, a chisel, a gun, a change of clothes,
<br>	a Swiss passport, and a huge false moustache, I may just stand a
<br>	chance.
<br>
<br>Baldrick: Ah....
<br>
<br>Edmund: Let's see, what have we here? A small painted wooden duck.
<br>
<br>Baldrick: Yeah, I thought if you get caught near water, you can balance
<br>	  it on the top of your head as a brillaint disguise.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Yeeeesss, I would, of course, have to escape first. Ah, but what's
<br>	this, unless I'm much mistaken, a hammer and a chisel?
<br>
<br>Baldrick: You *are* much mistaken!
<br>
<br>Edmund: A pencil and a miniature trumpet.
<br>
<br>Baldrick: Yes, a pencil so you can drop me a postcard to tell me how the break
<br>	  out went and a small little tiny miniature trumpet in case during
<br>	  your escape, you have to win favour with a difficult child.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Baldrick, I don't want to spend my last precious hours rummaging
<br>	through this feeble collection of stocking-fillers. Now let me ask
<br>	you some simple questions: is there are a saw in this bag?
<br>
<br>Baldrick: No.
<br>
<br>Edmund: A hammer?
<br>
<br>Baldrick: No.
<br>
<br>Edmund: A chisel?
<br>
<br>Baldrick: No.
<br>
<br>Edmund: A gun?
<br>
<br>Baldrick: No.
<br>
<br>Edmund: A false passport?
<br>
<br>Baldrick: (thinks) No.
<br>
<br>Edmund: A change of clothes?
<br>
<br>Baldrick: Yes sir, of course I wouldn't forget a change of clothes.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Ah, now that's something, let's see.....a Robin Hood costume.
<br>
<br>Baldrick: I put in a French peasant's outfit first, but then I thought
<br>	  'What if you arrive in a French peasant's village and they're
<br>	  in the middle of a fancy dress party?'
<br>
<br>Edmund: And what if I arrive in a French peasant village, dressed in a
<br>	Robin Hood costume and there *isn't* a fancy dress party?
<br>
<br>Baldrick: Well, to be quite frank sir, I didn't consider that eventuality,
<br>	  because if you did, you'd stick out like a.....
<br>
<br>Edmund: (interrupting) Like a man standing in a lake with a small painted
<br>	wooden duck on his head?
<br>
<br>Baldrick: Exactly!
<br>
<br>(re-enter Perkins)
<br>
<br>Perkins: Excuse me, sir.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Alright. Aaahhmm, thank you, Baldrick, we'll finish this picnic
<br>	later.
<br>
<br>Baldrick: (rather loudly) YUM YUM! (exits)
<br>
<br>Perkins: Do you mind if I disturb you for a moment, sir?
<br>
<br>Edmund: No, no, not at all.  My diary's pretty empty this week.  Let's see,
<br>	Thursday morning, get shot, yes, that's about it, actually.
<br>
<br>Perkins: It's just there's a few chaps out here would like a bit of a chinwag.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Oh, loveley.  Always keen to meet new poeple.
<br>
<br>Perkins: Corpral Jones and Privates Spacer, Robinson, and Tipperwick
<br>
<br>All: Hello
<br>
<br>Edmund: Oh, nice of you to drop by.  And what do you do?
<br>
<br>Leader: We're your firing squad, sir.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Of course you are.
<br>
<br>Squad man 2: Good sized chest.
<br>
<br>Leader: Shut up, lad.
<br>
<br>Squad man 2: Sir!
<br>
<br>Leader: You see, us firing squads are a bit like taxmen, sir, everyone hates
<br>	us, but we're just doin' our job,  'aven't we, sir?
<br>
<br>Edmund: My heart bleeds for you.
<br>
<br>Leader: Well, sir, we aim to please.  Just a little firing squad joke there,
<br>	sir!  You see, sir, we take pride in the termanatory service we
<br>	supply.  So, is there any particular area you'd like us to go for, hmm?
<br>	We can aim anywhere.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Well, in that case, just above my head might be a good spot.
<br>
<br>Leader: You see, a laugh and a smile, and all of a sudden the job doesn't seem
<br>	quite so bad after all, does it sir?
<br>
<br>Squad man 2: No, and a lovely roomy forehead.
<br>
<br>Squad man 3: A good pulse and jugular, there as well.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Look, I'm sorry, I know you mean to be friendly, but I hope you won't
<br>	take it amiss if I ask you to sod off and die.
<br>
<br>Leader: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, fair enough, 'course not, sir.  No one
<br>	likes being shot first thing in the morning, do they?  No, no, no,
<br>	So, look foreward to seeing you tomorow, sir.  You'll have a blindfold
<br>	on of course, but you'll recognize me.  I'm the one that says, "Ready,
<br>	aim, fire!"
<br>
<br>Edmund: Can I ask you to leave a pause between the word "aim" and the word
<br>	"fire"?  Thirty or forty years, perhaps?
<br>
<br>Leader: Ahh, wish I could pause, sir.  I really wish I could, but I can't, you
<br>	see, cos I'm a tabler, you see.
<br>
<br>(lots of inaudible lines, sorry)
<br>
<br>(Firing Squad leaves)
<br>
<br>Edmund: Perfect! I wonder if anything on earth could depress me more?
<br>
<br>(enter Baldrick)
<br>
<br>Baldrick: Excuse me, sir?
<br>
<br>Edmund: Of course it could.
<br>
<br>Baldrick: I forgot to give you this letter from Lieutenant George, sir.
<br>
<br>Edmund: (sarcastically) Ahh! Oh, joy! What wise words from the world's
<br>	greatest defence counsel. (reads letter) 'Dear Mother,'......un-
<br>	usual start, (continues) 'thanks for the case of Scotch.' You've
<br>	excelled yourself, Baldrick. You've brought the worng letter again!
<br>
<br>Baldrick: Ohh yeah, he did write two.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Yes, his mother's about to get a note, telling her he's sorry she's
<br>	going to be shot in the morning.....while *I* have to read this
<br>	drivel. (reads further) 'Count Celia thrives in the Pony Club trials
<br>	and that little Freddy scores a century for the first eleven'. (aside)
<br>	You can't deny, it's a riveting read...uhhh, 'Send my love to Uncle
<br>	Rupert', (aside) who'd have thought it, Mad Uncle Rupert, Minister of
<br>	War. Power of life or death over every bally soldier in the army.
<br>	Hang on a minute.....this is it! All George has to do is send him a
<br>	telegram and he'll get me off. (in a pleasant tone) Baldrick, I love
<br>	you! I want to kiss your cherry lips and nibble your shell-like ears.
<br>	I'm freeeee!
<br>
<br>(at BA's quarters, George is moping)
<br>
<br>George: I'm useless, useless!
<br>
<br>Baldrick: Sir, sir!
<br>
<br>George: Hello Private, how's the Captain?
<br>
<br>Baldrick: He's absolutely fine, sir, but..
<br>
<br>George: uhh, you're just trying to cheer me up. I know the truth. He hates
<br>	me cos I completely arsed up his defence.
<br>
<br>Baldrick: Yes, I know, sir, but..
<br>
<br>George: I'm thick, you see. I'm as thick as the big-print version of The Com-
<br>	plete Works of Charles Dickens. If only I could've saved him. If only!
<br>
<br>Baldrick: But you *can*, sir.
<br>
<br>George: What, how?
<br>
<br>Baldrick: You send a telegram.
<br>
<br>George: Of course! I send a telegram.
<br>
<br>Baldrick: Yeah!
<br>
<br>George: Who to?
<br>
<br>Baldrick: To the person in the letter.
<br>
<br>George: What letter?
<br>
<br>Baldrick: To your mother.
<br>
<br>George: I send a telegram to my mother?!
<br>
<br>Baldrick: No!
<br>
<br>George: No!
<br>
<br>Baldrick: You send a telegram to the person in the letter to your mother.
<br>
<br>George: Who was in the letter to my mother?
<br>
<br>Baldrick: I can't remember!
<br>
<br>George: Well, think, think!
<br>
<br>Baldrick: No, you think think!
<br>
<br>George: Well, I ahh...Stay here, of course, the Pony Club Trials. Yes! See
<br>	here, they can leap over the walls over the prison and save him.
<br>
<br>Baldrick: No, no!
<br>
<br>George: No, no, ahhhmm. Yes, cricket. Yes, I've got Cousin Freddie, of
<br>	course. He can knock out the firing squad with his cricket bat.
<br>
<br>Baldrick: No, there's someone else!
<br>
<br>George: (excited) Oh well, who!?
<br>
<br>Baldrick: I don't know.
<br>
<br>George: Well, neither do I!
<br>
<br>Baldrick: Well, think!
<br>
<br>George: You think!
<br>
<br>Baldrick: You think that!
<br>
<br>(both continue arguement, then....)
<br>
<br>George: No, it hasn't helped.
<br>
<br>Baldrick: Yes it has, sir. Your Uncle Rupert who's just been made Minister
<br>	  of War.
<br>
<br>George: Of course. Uncle Rupert shall be made Minister of War. Baldrick,
<br>	I'll, I'll send him a telegram and he'll, he'll pull strings and
<br>	scratch backs and fiddle with nobs, and....
<br>
<br>Baldrick: HURRAY!
<br>
<br>George: Well, I got there in the end, eh Baldrick?
<br>
<br>Baldrick: Oh, just about, sir.
<br>
<br>George: Ah, I think this calls for a celebration, don't you? What about a
<br>	toss of old Morehen's Shredded Sporum, which Mum has just sent over?
<br>	I drink a toast, don't you, to Captain Blackadder and freedom!
<br>
<br>Baldrick: Captain Blackadder and Freedom, sir.
<br>
<br>(outside, where Edmund is to be executed; Dawn, a cock crows)
<br>
<br>Edmund: 'Morning.
<br>
<br>Firing Squad (all): 'Morning.
<br>
<br>Perkins: I must say, Captain, I've got to admire your balls.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Prehaps later. (to Firing Squad) How are you doing?
<br>
<br>All: Very well, good.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Robinson, good to see you.
<br>
<br>Robinson: Good to see you, too, sir.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Ahh, Corporal, how's the voice?
<br>
<br>Corporal (referred to as Leader in an earlier scene): Excellent, sir.
<br>
<br>Edmund: So the phone's on the hook, is it Perkins?
<br>
<br>Perkins: Oh yes, sir.
<br>
<br>Edmund: So, where do you want me?
<br>
<br>Corporal: Well, up against the wall is traditional, sir.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Course it is. Ah...this side or the other side? (all laugh)
<br>	No messengers waiting, Perkins?
<br>
<br>Perkins: Oh, I'm afraid not, sir. Oh well.
<br>
<br>Corporal: Alright, lads, line up.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Yes, uahh...now look, I think there might have been a bit of a mis-
<br>	understanding, you see. I was expecting a telegram.
<br>
<br>Corporal: ATTENTION!
<br>
<br>Edmund: Quite an imporant one, actually.
<br>
<br>Corporal: TAKE AIM!
<br>
<br>A voice: Stop!
<br>
<br>Edmund: I think that's what they call 'the nick of time'.
<br>
<br>Voice: Letter for the Captain.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Of course it is. Read it please.
<br>
<br>Voice: Eh, 'here's looking at you. Love from all the boys in the firing squad.'
<br>
<br>Corporal: You soft bastards, you!
<br>
<br>Squad Man 2: After all we've got, I couldn't resist it.
<br>
<br>Edmund: (sarcastically) How thoughtful!
<br>
<br>Corporal: ATTENTION!
<br>
<br>Edmund: Now look, ah, something has gone spectacularly badly wrong.
<br>
<br>Corporal: TAKE AIM!
<br>
<br>Edmund: Baldrick, you're mincemeat!
<br>
<br>(at BA's quarters)
<br>
<br>George: (awaking) Oh, my head! Ah, my head! Feels like the time I was initiated
<br>	into teh Silly Buggers society at Cambridge. I misheard the rules and
<br>	push a whole oberjing into my earhole.
<br>
<br>Baldrick: Permission to die, sir.
<br>
<br>George: Oh! Bu-bu-bu-what started this drinking? Oh, yes, well,we were cele-
<br>	brating getting Captain Blackadder off scot...(realises it's too late)
<br>	free. Oh my sainted trousers, we forgot!
<br>
<br>Baldrick: Oh whoops.
<br>
<br>George: Oh no. He's dead, you see. He's dead dead dead because we're a pair of
<br>	selfish so and so's....(despairingly) oh, course, if I have a rope, I'd
<br>	put it around my neck and bally well hanged myself until it really hurt.
<br>
<br>(Edmund walks in)
<br>
<br>Edmund: Hi, George, 'morning, Baldrick. Still the striking resemblence to guppie
<br>	fish at feeding time. Yep, it arrived in the nick of time.
<br>
<br>George: Oh, excellent!
<br>
<br>Edmund: Ah, so you've got the Scotch out, haven't we?
<br>
<br>George: Oh, well, well, of course, sir, yes. We wanted to lay on a bit of a
<br>	bash for your safe return, ah..here you go. (gives Edmund a drink,
<br>	laughs)
<br>
<br>Edmund: There was a second telegram that arrived actually George, addressed     
<br>	personally to you by your Uncle.
<br>
<br>George: Oh, thank you, I....(tries to get letter from Edmund, who opens and
<br>	reads it)
<br>
<br>Edmund: (reads) 'George, my boy, Outraged to read in dispatches how that ass
<br>	Melchett made such a pig-ear out of your chum Blackadder's court-mar-
<br>	tial. Have reversed the decision forthwith. Surprised you didn't ask
<br>	me to do it yourself, actually.' Now this is interesting, isn't it?
<br>
<br>George: Uh, uhh, yes, well, I, you see, sir. Uh..the thing is..
<br>
<br>Edmund: You two got whammed last night, didn't you?
<br>
<br>George: We--well, well, no, uh, uh. not whammed exactly. A little tiddly,
<br>	perhaps.
<br>
<br>Edmund: And you forgot the telegram to your Uncle!
<br>
<br>George: Well, n--n--n-no. Not, not, not completely. Partially, umm....Well
<br>	yes, yes. Entirely.
<br>
<br>Baldrick: I think I can explain, sir.
<br>
<br>Edmund: Can you, Baldrick?
<br>
<br>Baldrick: (pause) No.
<br>
<br>Edmund: As I suspected. Now, I'm not a religious man, as you know. Henceforth,
<br>	I shall nightly pray to the God, who killed Cain and squashed Sampson,
<br>	that He comes out of retirement and gets back into practice on the
<br>	pair of you!
<br>
<br>(phone rings; Edmund answers it)
<br>
<br>Edmund: Captain Blackadder. Ah, Captain Darling. Well, you know, some of us
<br>	just have friends in high places, I suppose. Yes, I can hear you per-
<br>	fectly. You want what? You want two volunteers for a mission into No
<br>	Man's Land, Code name: Operation Certain Death. yes, yes I think I
<br>	have just the fellows. (hangs up; to George and Baldrick) God is
<br>	*very* quick these days.
