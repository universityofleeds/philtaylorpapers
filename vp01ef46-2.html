"It should get them."<br><br>Kenneth Y. Tomlinson, chairman of the BBG, the independent federal agency that oversees all U.S. international broadcasting, said of the report's recommendations, "We believe that the people of the Middle East and elsewhere are best served by providing them the truth. That's what our broadcasting does."<br><br>On page 377 of its report, the 9/11 commission made the following recommendation:<br>"Recognizing that Arab and Muslim audiences rely on satellite television and radio, the government has begun some promising initiatives in television and radio broadcasting to the Arab world, Iran, and Afghanistan. These efforts are beginning to reach large audiences." The report said the BBG has asked for more money, and should get it.<br><br>Bolstering the need for U.S. broadcasting initiatives, the report said: "Local newspapers and the few influential satellite broadcasters -- like al Jazeera -- often reinforce the jihadist theme that portrays the United States as anti-Muslim."<br><br>Currently, the BBG's annual budget of more than $550 million goes to broadcasts around the world through various entities, including the Voice of America (VOA); Alhurra television and Radio Sawa, Arabic-language broadcasts; Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) and Radio Free Asia (RFA.) <br><br>Since 9/11, the BBG has taken steps to dramatically increase its broadcasting to key areas. <br><br>"    The Middle East: Alhurra, a new satellite television channel launched in February 2004, is aimed at Arabic-speaking viewers in 22 countries across the Middle East. Radio Sawa, a 24/7 station, has garnered large audiences of young people in the region with its mix of news, information and Western and Arabic music.<br><br>"    Iran: Radio Farda, a youth-oriented, 24/7 radio, covers news about Iran, along with entertainment and features. It is a joint project of VOA and RFE/RL. VOA-TV launched a successful, daily, Persian-language show, News and Views, broadcast to audiences by satellite. Additionally, VOA has a Persian service and two other weekly television shows.<br><br>"    Afghanistan: Audiences in that country are able to listen to a 24-hour stream of news, information and other programs in Dari and Pashto. These are run by the VOA and Radio Free Afghanistan, which is part of RFE/RL. Additionally, the BBG arranged for two medium-wave transmitters to be installed in Kabul - one for the BBG, the other for Afghanistan to help bolster its media.<br><br>"    Pakistan: The VOA recently expanded its Urdu service to 12 hours daily to reach more Urdu-speaking listeners in Pakistan and parts of India.<br><br>The BBG is an independent federal agency which supervises all U.S. government-supported non-military international broadcasting, including the Voice of America (VOA), Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL); the Middle East Television Network (Alhurra); Radio Free Asia (RFA); Office of Cuba Broadcasting (Radio and TV Mart√≠); Radio Sawa and Radio Farda. The services broadcast in 55 languages to over 100 million people around the world. Nine members comprise the BBG, a presidentially appointed body. Current governors are Chairman Kenneth Y. Tomlinson, Joaquin Blaya, Blanquita W. Cullum, D. Jeffrey Hirschberg, Edward E. Kaufman, Norman J. Pattiz, Veronique Rodman and Steven Simmons. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell serves as an ex officio member.<br><br> <br><br><br>
